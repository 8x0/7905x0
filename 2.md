WHAT I BELIEVE 

I am deeply honored to participate in the Symposium, The 
Faith J Live By, compiled and edited by Krishna M. Talgeri, 
and to contribute this paper particularly written for the con- 
templative audience of Indian readers.* This is the first op- 
portunity I have had to write a 'credo 1 , where I do not need 
to go into theoretical explanations. 

It happens that 1 come from an old family of agriculturists, 
mathematicians, soldiers, jurists, and engineers, etc. When 1 
was five years old my father, an engineer, gave me the feel 
of the world's most important scientific discoveries of the 
nineteenth century, which prepared the groundwork for the 
scientific achievements of the twentieth century and remain 
fundamentally valid today. The feel of the differential calcu- 
lus, as well as non-euclidean and four-dimensional geometries, 
which he conveyed to me at that time shaped the future inter- 
ests and orientations of my life, and became the foundation 
of rny whole work. 

My observations and theoretical studies of life and mathe- 
matics, mathematical foundations, many branches of sciences, 

*This was originally written in 1948 in response to an invitation 
from Mr. Krishna Mangesh Talgeri, M.A. of 26, Atul Grove, New 
Delhi, India, to contribute to a symposium entitled, The Faith I 
Live By, It is to be published soon, and includes such international 
contributors as Gandhi, Nehru, Montessori, John H, Holmes, Rad- 
hakrishnan and others. I admit that without Mr. Talgeri's invita- 
tion, and the most valuable assistance of Miss Charlotte Schuchardt, 
which I wish to gratefully acknowledge, I would never have 
undertaken the difficult task of formulating such a condensed sum- 
mary of life studies and experiences which any 'credo* would 
require.

also history, history of cultures, anthropology, 'philosophy', 
psychology*, 'logic', comparative religions, etc, convinced me 
that : 

1 ) Human evaluations with reference to themselves were 
mythological or zoological, or a combination of both ; but, 

2) Neither of these approaches could give us a workable 
base for understanding the living, uniquely human, extremely 
complex (deeply inter-related) reactions of Sniithi, Smiths, 
etc*, generalized in such high-order abstractions as 'mind*, or 
'intellect' ; and, 

3) A functional analysis, free from the old mythological 
and zoological assumptions, showed that humans, with the 
most highly developed nervous system, are uniquely charac- 
terized by the capacity of an individual or a generation to be- 
gin where the former left off. I called this essential capacity 
'time-binding'. This can be accomplished only by a class of life 
which uses symbols as means for time-binding. Such a capacity 
depends on and necessitates 'intelligence', means of communi- 
cation, etc. On this inherently human level of interdependence 
time-binding leads inevitably to feelings of responsibility, duty 
toward others and the future, and therefore to some type of 
ethics, morals, and similar social and/or socio-cultural re- 
actions. 

In the time-binding orientation I took those characteristics 
for granted as the empirical end-products of the functioning 
of the healthy human nervous system. 

It was a fundamental error of the old evaluations to pos- 
tulate 'human nature' as 'evil', 'Human nature 1 depends to a 
large extent on the character of our creeds or rationalizations, 
etc., for these ultimately build up our socio-cultural and other 
environments. 

I believe that our approaches to the problems of humans 
have been vitiated by primitive methods of evaluation which 
still often dominate our attitudes and outlooks. With a time- 
binding consciousness, our criteria of values, and so behaviour, 
are based on the study of human potentialities, not on statis-

tical averages on the level of homo ho mini lupus drawn from 
primitive and/or un-sane semantic (evaluational) reactions 
which are on record. Instead of studying elemental is tic think- 
ing', 'feeling 1 , 'intellect 5 , 'emotion', eta, a misguiding ap- 
proach implying the inherited archaic, artificial, divisions or 
schizophrenic splits of human characteristics which actually 
cannot be split, 1 investigated functionally and therefore non- 
el erne n talis tic ally the psycho-biological mechanisms of time- 
binding — how they work. 

By induction we pass from particulars to the general. How- 
ever, this method is not reliable enough. We have to build 
a deductive system and verify empirically whether the gen- 
eral applies to the eventual random particular, which then 
would become the foundation for predictability. This, after 
all, ts the main aim of all science. So far what we 'knew* 
about 'man' were statistical averages gathered Inductively, 
and so our human world picture was rather sad, distorted, if 
not hopeless. The human understanding of time-binding as 
explained here establishes the deductive grounds for a full- 
fledged 'science of man', where both inductive and deductive 
methods are utilized. I believe that this very point of in- 
ductive and deductive scientific methods with regard to hu- 
mans tangibly marks a sharp difference between the child- 
hood and the manhood of humanity. In other words, we try 
to learn from the study of the individual the main charac- 
teristics of the phylum (the human race). Now with the 
time-binding theory, for the first time to my knowledge, hav- 
ing accumulated data by induction (statistical averages) , we 
can start with what we have learned about the phylum and 
analyze the individual from the point of view of human po- 
tentialities as a phylum. I may be wrong, but perhaps this 
may become the turning of a page of human history. 

I could not use, in my further studies, the older Wganism- 
as-a- whole' approaches, but had to base my analysis on the 
much more complex 'organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment', 
1 had to include neuro-linguistic and neuro -semantic (evalua-

tional) environments as environments, and also had to con- 
sider geographic, physico-chemical, economic, political, ecolog- 
ical, socio-cultural, etc., conditions as factors which mould 
human personalities, and so even group behaviour. This state- 
ment is entirely general, and applies to highly civilized people 
as well as the most primitive. 

Common sense and ordinary observations convinced me that 
the average, so-called 'normal pe rsun* is so extremely complex 
as to practically evade an over-all analysis. So 1 had to con- 
centrate on the study of two extremes of human psycho- 
logical reactions: a) reactions at their best, because of their 
exceptional predictability, as in mathematics, the foundations 
of mathematics, mathematical physics, exact sciences, etc., 
which exhibit the deepest kind of strictly human psycho- 
logical reactions, and b) reactions at their worst, as exempli- 
fied by psychiatric cases. In these investigations I discovered 
that physico-mathematical methods have application to our 
daily life on all levels, linking science with problems of sanity, 
in the sense of adjustment to 'facts 1 and 'reality'. 

I found that human reactions within these two limits do not 
differ in some objectified 'kind 1 , but only in psycho-biological 
degrees*, and that the 'normal' person hovers somewhere in 
between the two extremes- Nobody is as 'insane* as the com- 
posite picture a textbook of psychiatry would give us, and 
nobody is as sane as that wmieh a textbook of sanity would 
give, the author included. The mechanisms of time-binding 
are exhibited in most humans except those with severe psycho- 
biological illnesses. However, some inaccessible dogmatists in 
power, particularly dictators of every kind, have blocked this 
capacity considerably. Clearly police states of secrecy, with- 
holding from the people knowledge of, and from, the world, 
or twisting that knowledge to suit their purposes, 'iron cur- 
tains*, etc., must be classified as saboteurs among time-binders, 
and certainly not a socio-cultural asset to the evolution of 
humanity. 

Linguistic and grammatical structures also have prevented 



What I Believe 



5 



our understanding of human reactions. For instance, we used 
and still use a terminology of 'objective' and 'subjective', both 
extremely confusing, as the so-called 'objective' must be con- 
sidered a construct made by our nervous system, and what 
we call 'subjective' may also be considered 'objective' for the 
same reasons. 

My analysis showed that happenings in the world outside 
our skins, and also such organismal psycho -logical reactions 
inside our skins as those we label f feelings 1 , * thinking*, 'emo- 
tions', iove\ 'hate', 'happiness 1 , 'unhappiness', 'anger', 'fear 1 , 
'resentment 1 , 'pain', 'pleasure 1 , etc*, occur only on the non- 
verbal, or what I call silent levels. Our speaking occurs on 
the verbal levels, and we can speak about, but not on f the 
silent or un-speakable levels. This sharp, and inherently natu- 
ral, yet thoroughly unorthodox differentiation between verbal 
and non-verbal levels automatically eliminates the useless 
metaphysical verbal bickerings of millenniums about 'the na- 
ture of things', 'human nature', etc. For many metaphysical 
verbal futile arguments, such as solipsism, or 'the unknow- 
able', have been the result of the identifications of verbal 
levels with the silent levels of happenings, 'feelings', etc., 
that the words are merely supposed to represent, never being 
the 'reality' behind them. 

Such psycho -logical manifestations as those mentioned 
above can be dealt with in a unified terminology of evalua- 
tion, with the result that an empirical general theory of 
values, or general semantics, becomes possible, and, with its 
roots in the methods of exact sciences, this can become the 
foundation of a science of man. For through the study of 
exact sciences we can discover factors of sanity* Different 
philosophical trends as found in disciplines such as Nominal- 
ism, Realism, Phenomenalism, Signifies, Semiotic, Logical 
Positivism, etc., also become unified by a methodology, with 
internationally applicable techniques, which I call 'non-aristo- 
telian*, as it includes, yet goes beyond and brings up to date, 
the aims and formulations of Aristotle.

Appendix VI 



Whatever we may say something is, obviously if not the 
'something' on the silent levels. Indeed, as Wittgenstein 
wrote, 'What can be shown, cannot be said,' In my experience 
I found that it is practically impossible to convey the differen- 
tiation of silent (un-speakable) levels from the verbal with- 
out having the reader or the hearer pinch with one hand the 
finger of the other hand. He would then realize organ ism ally 
that the first-order psycho- logical direct experiences arc not 
verbal. The simplicity of this statement is misleading, unless 
we become aware of its implications, as in our living reactions 
most of us identify in value the two entirely different levels, 
with often disastrous consequences. Note the sadness of the 
beautiful passage of Eddington on page 1 i. He seems to be 
unhappy that the silent levels can never be the verbal levels. 
Is this not an example of unjustified 'maximum expectation* ? 

I firmly believe that the consciousness of the differences be- 
tween these levels of abstractions; i.e., the silent and the ver- 
bal levels, is the key and perhaps the first step for the solution 
of human problems. This belief is based on my own observa- 
tions, and studies of the endless observations of other in- 
vestigators. 

There is a tremendous difference between 'thinking' in 
verbal terms, and 'contemplating 1 , inwardly silent, on non- 
verbal levels, and then searching for the proper structure of 
language to fit the supposedly discovered structure of the 
silent processes that modern science tries to find. If we 'think 1 
verbally, we act as biased observers and project onto the silent 
levels the structure of the language we use, and so remain 
in our rut of old orientations, making keen, unbiased, obser- 
vations and creative work well-nigh impossible. In contrast, 
when we 'think' without words, or in pictures (which involve 
structure and therefore relations), we may discover new 
aspects and relations on silent levels, and so may produce im- 
portant theoretical results in the general search for a similarity 
of structure between the two levels, silent and verbal. Prac- 
tically all important advances are made that way. 



What I Believe

So far the only possible link between the two levels is found 
in terms of relations, which apply equally to both non-verbal 
and verbal levels, such as 'order* (serial, linear, cyclic, spiral, 
etc.)* 'between-ness*, ^space-time*, 'equality* or 'inequality', 
'before', 'after', more than', 'less than', etc. Relations, as fac- 
tors of structure, give the sole content of all human knowl- 
edge. 

It has been said that f to know anything we have to know 
everything'. Unfortunately it is true, but expressed in ike 
above form 'knowledge' would be impossible. Mathematicians 
solved this impasse simply and effectively. They introduced 
postulational methods, thus limiting the Everything*, out of 
which the limited 'anything* follows. 

The identification (confusion) of verbal with silent levels 
leads automatically to the asking of indefinitely long arrays 
of verbal 'why's*, as if the verbal levels could ever possibly 
cover all the factors and chains of antecedents of the silent 
levels, or ever 'be 1 the silent levels* This is why in science we 
limit our 'why* to the data at hand, thus avoiding the un- 
limited metaphysical questioning without data, to which there 
cannot be an answer. Mathematicians solved these inherent 
dilemmas by stating explicitly their undefined terms in their 
postulational systems, terms which label nothing but occur- 
rences on the silent levels. Metaphysicians of many kinds or 
many creeds since time immemorial tried to solve the same 
perplexities by postulating different 'prime movers 1 or 'final 
causes', beyond which the further 'why* is ruled out as leading 
to the logically 'verboten* 'infinite regress*. Originally re- 
ligions were polytheistic. Later, in the attempt for unifica- 
tion, perhaps to strengthen the power of the priesthood, and 
also because of the increasing ability of humans to make gen- 
eralizations, monotheisms were invented, which have led to 
the most cruel religious wars. Different rulers, dictators, 
'fuehrers', etc, have followed si miliar psycho- logical patterns 
with historically known destructive or constructive results. 
The above statements are limited by the historical contexts.

Appendix VI 



In our human evolutionary development the structures of 
religions and sciences, because all man-made, do not differ 
psycho-logically. They all depend on fundamental assump- 
tions, hypotheses, etc., from which we try to build some under- 
standing of, and/or rapport with, this world, ourselves in- 
cluded. Some of these involve archaic and false -to- fact as- 
sumptions, etc, others, such as sciences, involve modern, 
potentially verifiable, assumptions and hypotheses, In brief, 
any religion may be considered 'primitive science* to satisfy 
human unconscious* organismal longings; and modern science 
may be considered 4 up-to-date religion', to satisfy consciously 
the same human feelings. If we are supposed not to separate 
elementalistically 'emotion' and 'intellect* , we have to take 
into consideration organismal longings spread over continents 
for millenniums, which find their proper expression according 
to the date of the specific human developments, at a date. 
Religions and sciences are both expressions of our human 
search for security, and so predictability, for solace, guidance, 
feelings of 'belonging', etc*, culminating in self-realization 
through a general 'consciousness of abstracting*, the main 
aim of my work. 

The progress of modern science, including the new science 
of man as a time- hinder, has been due uniquely to the free- 
dom of scientists to revise their fundamental assumptions, ter- 
minologies, undefined terms, which involve hidden assump- 
tions, etc, underlying our reflections, a freedom prohibited in 
'primitive sciences' and also in dictatorships, past and present. 

As to the space-time problem of the * beginning and the end 
of the world*, I have 'solved* it for myself effectively by the 
conviction that we are not yet evolved enough and so mature 
enough as humans to be able to understand such problems at 
this date. In scientific practice, however, I would go on } in 
search for structure, asking 'why* under consciously limited 
conditions. Probably in the future this problem will be shown 
to be no problem, and the solution will be found in the dis- 
appearance of the problem* By now science has already solved 



What I Believe

many dilemmas which at first seemed insoluble, as exempli- 
fied, for instance, in the new quantum mechanics. 

Another important point which clarifies the problem of the 
'unknowable', religions, etc, is that we humans have a ca- 
pacity for inferential knowledge, which is not based on sense 
data, but on inferences from observed happenings. All modern 
sciences on the submicroscopic, electro-colloidal, etc, levels 
are of this 'as if character. In fact, inferential knowledge 
today leads to testing in unexpected fields, and so is very 
creative. E p iste m olog ically the fundamental theories must 
develop in converging lines of investigation, and if they do not 
converge it is an indication that there are flaws in the theories, 
and they are revised. Inferential knowledge today in science is 
much more reliable than sense data, which often deceive us. 
In religions we also translate the still unknown into infer- 
entially 'known', which become creeds, but based on primitive 
or prescientific assumptions. The most primitive religion in 
which the savage believes, or the more generalized and more 
organized religions in which the 'man in the street 1 believes, 
represent non-elemental istkally his inferential 'knowledge*, 
which involves his 'feelings', wishes, desires, needs, fears, and 
what not, as combined inseparably in living reactions with his 
'intellect'. 

I firmly believe that the still prevailing archaic, split, schiz- 
ophrenic orientations about ourselves, which without a 
modern science of man are practically impossible to avoid, are 
an extremely hampering influence to any understanding of the 
potentialities of 'human nature'. These outlooks, inherited 
from the 'childhood of humanity 1 and perpetuated linguisti- 
cally, keep our human reactions and so our cultures on un- 
necessarily low levels, from which we try to extricate our- 
selves through violence, murder, rioting, and in larger expres- 
sions of mass sufre rings, through revolutions and wars. This is 
in sharp contrast to the peaceful progress we have in science, 
where we are free to analyze our basic assumptions, and 
where we use a language of appropriate structure. 



10 



Appendix VI 



I firmly believe that an adequate structure of language is 
fundamental for human adjustment to the silent levels of hap- 
penings, 'feeling**, etc. Thus, the non-clementalistic Einstein - 
Minkowski space-time, instead of the split, elemental is tic new- 
tonian 'space' and 'time', revolutionized physics. The non- 
elementalistic psycho-biology of Adolf Meyer, instead of 
'psychology' and 'biology*, marks the sharp difference between 
humans and animals. Non-elemental istic psychosomatic con- 
siderations,, instead of the older 'psyche* and 'soma', revolu- 
tionized the whole of medicine and rescued it from being 
merely glorified veterinary science. Etc., etc, I give these 
specific examples to indicate the general practical value of 
structural linguistic innovations which express and convey to 
others our new structural outlooks. 

I am deeply convinced by theoretical considerations and 
empirical data that the new {historically the first to my 
knowledge) formulation of time-binding throws enormous 
light on our understanding of 'human nature*, and will help 
to formulate new perspectives for the future of time-binders. 
This new functional definition of humans as time-binders, 
not mere 'space-binders*, carries very far-reaching scientific, 
psycho-logical, moral and ethical beneficial consequences, 
which often remain lasting, today verified in many thousands 
of instances. It explains also how we humans, and humans 
alone, were able to produce sciences and civilizations, making 
us by necessity interdependent, and the builders of our own 
destinies. 

All through history man has been groping to find his place 
in the hierarchy of life, to discover, so to say, his role in the 
'nature of things'. To this end he must first discover himself 
and his 'essential nature*, before he can fully realize himself 
— then perhaps our civilizations will pass by peaceful evolu- 
tions from their childhood to the manhood of humanity. 

It is a source of deep satisfaction to me that similar notions 
about the circularity and self-reflexiveness of human knowl- 
edge are taking root in our orientations as expressed by other 



What I Believe 



writers. In 1942 in Monograph III published by the Insti- 
tute of General Semantics, in my foreword with M. Ken dig, 
we wrote ; 

'It should be noticed that in human life self-reflexiveness 
has even "material" implications, which introduce serious 
difficulties. Professor Cassius J. Kcyser expresses this very 
aptly: "It is obvious, once the fact is pointed out, that the 
character of human history, the character of human conduct, 
and the character of all our human institutions depend both 
upon what man is and in equal or greater measure upon 
what we humans think man is." This is profoundly true. 

'Professor Arthur S. Eddington describes the same prob- 
lem in these words: "And yet, in regard to the nature of 
things, this knowledge is only an empty shell — a form of 
symbols. It is knowledge of structural form, and not knowl- 
edge of content. All through the physical world runs that 
unknown content, which must surely be the stuff of our 
consciousness. Here is a hint of aspects deep within the 
world of physics, and yet unattainable by the methods of 
physics. And. moreover, we have found that where science 
has progressed the farthest, the mind has but regained from 
nature that which the mind has put into nature. 

L "We have found a strange foot-print on the shores of 
the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after 
another, to account for its origin. At last, we have succeeded 
in reconstructing the creature that made the foot-print. 
And Lo! it is our own." 

'Dr. Alexis Carrel formulated the same difficulty dif- 
ferently, but just as aptly: "To progress again man must 
remake himself. And he cannot remake himself without 
suffering. For he is both the marble and the sculptor/' 1 

Those self- reflexive and circular mechanisms are the uniquely 
human types of reaction which made our human achievements 
possible. With the new formulations, the consciousness of this 
special capacity with its profound implications has become 
generally teachable on all levels, that of uneducated people 
and children included, and this consciousness may now mark 
a new period in our evolution. 

History, anthropology, and general semantics establish 
firmly that the enormous majority of humanity so far lived 



12 



Appendix VI 



and live on the animal biological level of mere subsistence, 
without the opportunity to realize their potentialities. For 
time-binders are not merely biological organisms, but psycho- 
biological, and this introduces incredible complexities, which 
so far we did not know how to handle. The old notions about 
'man' have hitherto led to a generally sick and bewildered so- 
ciety. We cannot be psycho-logical isolationists and try to be 
constructive time-binders, or we are bound to be bogged down 
in an asocial morass of conflicts* 

The theory of time -binding and extensional methods of 
general semantics have been tested in many scientific, edu- 
cational and managerial fields. Even on the battlefields of 
World War II they were applied by American physicians, 
officers and men in thousands of cases of 'battle fatigue', with 
telling results. Today the new methods are taught in many 
schools and universities, and there are study groups on alt 
continents. 

To conclude, I may quote from my new preface to the 
third edition of Science and Sanity: 'We need nol blind our- 
selves with the old dogma that "human nature cannot be 
changed", for we find that it can be changed [if we know 
how]. We must begin to realize our potentialities as humans, 
then we may approach the future with some hope. We may 
feel with Galileo, as he stamped his foot on the ground after 
recanting the Copcrnican theory before the Holy Inquisition, 
fC Eppur si muovef" The evolution of our human development 
may be retarded, but it cannot be stopped.*
