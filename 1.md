Working Formula For General Semantics: 
"I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE.'" - AK 



1st lecture, 6/2 GENERAL SEMANTICS 

I. 

(Approach.:) What is it all about? You may have difficulty at first 
in understanding ^. S. for l) what I say is baby-stuff, too simple; 
2) we have much knowledge that we do not apply. In G« S, we have 
co mbined th e knoiYledge that is current and _abst_r_aoted mejthqd, The ele- 
mentary results of science "are~we 11 known, "But what" Ts the method 
behind the results? How do we get what we know? This is one of the 
most important questions for education. 

(Discussion:) The word semantics is from the Greek - to signify, to 
mean* Interplay of words with words is how we build meaning in the 
old way (intensional). Can this be done? No, we_ have to st art with 
words_ .that are undefined. Before we can have a "theory of meaning, we 
have to investigate terms that underlie all meaning. If you want to 
try a vicious experiment, take some simple word or phrase that a friend 
has used and ask him what he means. Then you will soon find out the 
meaning of what I've just said. This is very well known in mathematics. 
I refer you to what Keyser said in his Mathematical Philosophy about 
logical miracles and asses,' 

Our work is strictly experimental, G. S, does not work as a theory of 
meaning but works as a general theory of values. How do we act? By 
organismal evaluations," ~You" are to understand that the term evaluation 
i s_ a _st_r uc tur al t e rm» i» e, you cannot split emotion and intellect, ~ 
Sanity can be called proper evaluation; unsanity (insanity is a legal 
term only) misevaluation. You ask what do you mean by proper evaluation? 
1 answer: scientific. Evaluation has to be tested empirically. If 
your predictions work out, you have proper evaluation, A good example 
here can be found in Eddington. In text-books you get horizontal pre- 
dictions; vertical ones work in living. Evaluation applies to all sci- 
ences and to your own affairs. Its standards are predictability and 
experimentation. 

Predictability involves factors of sanity. It saves the shock of sur- 
prise. Nothing is more difficult than to discover the obvious. By 
example, soldiers in the world war who expected horrors, did not break 
down; soldiers who did not expect horrors, did. We are revising daily 
all we know. Predictability exists in mathematics. We learn wisdom 
in G. S, from mathematics but we do not use mathematics. In application 
we clear up the old linguistic messes. Many problems are no problems 
at all, just verbal fictions, 

Our religious training, so education, cannot exist without Aristotle, 
You know why, why, why? Do you really get any answers? A limited 
why is alright - this is what we have in science. The unlimited why 
splits us. We see its results plainly in dementia praecox, (story 
here of talcing 4 hours to explain to a student (patient); "You think 
with your toe as with your brain . . • look at your toe and feel better J") 

G» S. d eals with living re actions, (Then followed various examples of 
evaluation, including a story about Napoleon and Jesus Christ, one to 
illustrate that if you feel ins^fulted, you are infantile, and also 
some comments on Hitler.) You know "Mein Kampf"? Several answers 
have been written to it, Lewis Muniford recently wrote one. He calls 
it Men Must Act, He tries to defend democracy. Remember I am not 
talking politics; I am talking about a general typo of human reaction, 

- 1 - 



1 s t _l e o tu r e_, _c o nt ! _n ' d 2 

Mumford sees democracy as a way of life. To have this kind of a demo- 
cracy, pre-supposes intelligence. The problem is shall we be intelli- 
gent? Can we be intelligent? Are we trained in intelligence? If 
so, then we can have democracy, I assume intelligence; natural way of 
mankind; democracy. Without intelligence, democracy is worse than any- 
thing else. Do we have educational methods that develop intelligence? 
The old ways kill intelligence; they're fact-cramming. 

Regarding Hitler, the facts he presents are true; his connections - 
relations - of them, false. He has a persecution complex. The world 
cannot be saved by politicians. How do you react when I ask you if 
we should have an examination of any political leader? Can you take it? 
(Example of conduct of man who when dead was found to have brain tumors - 
also humorous story of Oriental ruler who saluted Queen Victoria by 
thumbing his hand-to-nose J ) 

Some standard of evaluation cannot be avoided. We are born into a set 
of values. This is why we speak in terms of neuro-semantics and neuro- 
linguistics. Our human levels can never avoid a neuro-linguistic or 
verbal environment. It plays havoc with us. Let me read you a few 
examples: (reading here from an article by Prof. Snidecor of Idaho, 
titled Emotional Connotations of Personality, Western Speech, May 1939, 
comprising concise summaries of life tragedies made and exposed through 
words), 

What is peculiar about the way we use the term evaluation? It is non- 
elementalistic; it is a structural term. That means you cannot split 
its meaning; it keeps you integrated; you can't go off into verbal spec- 
ulation with it. Benefit of science depends upon predictability; pre- 
dictability depends upon structural assumptions on the bottom of any 
theory. When you have proper terminology, you have a hard-going sci- 
ence. How about the power of terminology? Terminology has structural 
assumptions that carry the day. 

You should understand what I mean by structural assumptions, I recommend 
you rt ad Rainich on this. In the old days, we had matter and mass; in 
space-time we have no mass; wo have space-time curvature. We hear much 
of Aristotle, Euclid and Newton; and also of Non-Euclidean geometries 
now and Non-Newtonian physics. In Euclid wo had lines that never met - 
parallels, Euclid built on ideal structure; equi-distant. Ride on a 
street-car today., Do you bump? How about Euclid? We build curves 
from little bits of straight lines, Non*Euclidean geometry gets us a 
light ray; straight line is also crooked now J 

Newton separated space and time and matter - fictionj Einstein inte- 
grated space and time and curvature of space-time. It cannot be dis- 
membered. Aristotle classified the body, mind, emotions, etc. He 
was elcmontalistic; ho split, G« S« terminology does not split. 
Evaluation, reactions, neuro- semantic - these terms don't split. In 
n ature we cannot spl it. Why split in language? If so, we go astray 



• 



People may say from a practical point of view: "Why I never knew anything 
about iiristotleJ" Is that so? Whether a believer in religion or not, 
you have had Aristotelian training; you could not escape it, (it per- 
meates all our linguistic behavior,) 

When electricity comes in, there is no more Newton and Euclid, You can 
build a car by Newton and Euclid but you cannot run it. It takes non-N 



l£^lec_^ure, _cont'r}_^d 3 

and non*B to do that. By Aristotle you can build a world like Europe 
but you cannot be sane. Sanity is more than "rough stuff". No one 
is as insane as a text-book.' 

As living beings, we have impasses j minor maladjustments enter into 
everyone's life; we have to have standards of sanity and insanity to be 
useful. The vrorld has changed completely. This affects everyone. 
We live actually in an entirely different v/orld than our fancy dictates. 
The older orientations live in Aristotle, Newton and Euclid, one reason 
why world is going to pieces. You and I live now in the connecting 
period. We are building up a new civilization, not with miracles but 
with scientific method, Personal opinion has to be backed by opinion 
of race: science. 

We have to know about limits; now a straight line is the limit of a 
curve. Read Yiittigstein on this. Someone has said that a straight 
line is whatever you think it, but a point is a place for arguments 
Progressive Education (.Assn.?) began some 3 years ago a Non-S experiment; 
little has been published as yet for work is not finished, 

(Advice to class - "Make notes. What I say soems simple, I give it a 
jocular presentation but it is a hcc.vy foundation - make notes,") 

Yet there is a connection between A, N and E; also a relation between 
non-A, non-N, and non-E. The new is broader than old. When you get 
the new, the old is only a limitation - a specific case. Have to 
broaden our whole world outlook, (story here of Mrs, Tomcat who declared 
there was very little difference between men and women, and the Irishman 
iiio thanked God for that little difference,) In science, a little dif- 
ference can raise hell. It is very hard to get hold of the new as it is 
different from the old, but when you do get hold of the new (orientation) 
you will find it easier - more workable - than old. 



vie now pass to the problem of the mechanism of learning, (Ex, given here 
of squash root and its learning capacity - then ex, of amoeba,; The 
amoeba is a drop of life, no organs, no brain, undifferentiated. Yet 
the amoeba shows that life on every level has some degree of neural-mus- 
cular behavior, (cf, S&S, Ch, XXII, *p,345f.*) Child in his work on 
physiological gradients, a theory that is physico-chemical, shows how 
the rate of metabolism may become structural in the organism. Then the 
amoeba gets a head-end, a brain. 

The nerv o us system is a re sult of the impact of environment . The nervous 
system and brain have the fastest rate of" metabolism, "Toall the brain 
our cosmic corn ; ire have developed it by impact. Our cortex is one of 
our "latest developments; impact upon impact has given the cortex layers 
upon layers. The linguistic layers are very late ones, a process of 
evolution and the impact of environment. 

It is practically impossible to talk sense about the nervous system. It 
is a__l iving pr ocess, an elo ct ro-colloidal transformation , I refer you 
to the work of fir, Burridgo; "it guarantees a revolution. It makes little 
difference whether his theory is correct or not. The importance is that 
he has discovered 2 mechanisms in place of 1, the ordinary p hysiology with 
tho_ c olloids . To think colloidally you have to have the non-A (non- 
Aristotelian) orientation. 



1st l®cture/_ oont 'n 1 d 4 

Fishes have different kind of adjustment* sufficient for their life 9 but 
we may have a perfect brain yet be totally maladjusted. The new brai n 
_we_have is our cortex; t he old one i s t he _t hal amu s . (cf, rough diagram 
of 1 this on p. 13 of this ms.) "This verbal division is misleading* Every 
part of the brain is functionally connected with every other par t* The 
predominant region in liv ing life is thalamic; the cort ical area- are ou r 
latest center's , *This is the" neurological key to undorstand G-_. _b.* 
thalamus' has: id linguistic representation, Our troubles' are tha lam ic i 
oannot__o hange by ve rb i age , 

The issue is CAM WE CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE TO INVOLVE THE 
THALAMIC REGION? All art involves thalamic factors, IN G.S, WE INTRO 
DUCE THALAMIC FaCTORS INTO A NON-LINGUISTIC THALAMUS AND SO WE CAN COM- 
MUNICATE TO THE THALAMUS. With the extensional devices that the thalamus 
begins to understand, we use thalamic means. (Further examples given 
here of the experiences of pikes and minnows in learning.) Realize^ t hat 
whatev er we learn tha i amic a lly stays put . The thalamus takes on aid the 
impressions, excitements", reactions to stimuli. It becomes permanently 
over stimulated. The cortex h as the important ro le in norms! life_ to 
prote ct the thalam us, "otherwise we get neurotic or psychotic.. "Here comes 
in linguistic structure; dogmas j creods, etc. based on language. In 
most cases instead of protecting the thalamus, our heads add to the ex- 
citation. We train children in split language; we train them in split 
personalities. Split personality comes about that way, (ex, of the 
thief who asserted he did not steal.) Tho old problem is such that our 
thalamus and our cortex do not coordinate. In G. S, training we have 
and we do coordinate them. 

I discuss in my book the experiments made with lower animals, i.e. star- 
fish and -worms. (cf. SecS, p, 347 and 123ff.) (Stories here also of 
the professor who shouted "Don't quote me to me J", and of the one who said 
that any fool could ask questions that a wise man could not ansvrer and a 
student who then asked him "Is that why you flunked me?") If you cut off 
tho head of a worm, the lesson is forgotten; it takes a worm 3 times as 
long to loam without a head, Tho organism learn s as-a-wholo. The amoeba 
is happy in a life that is slow, "But we are in an impasse Tor we live 
now in a world where the scientists use their cortex. I repeat the crucial 
problem is the coordination of the linguistic cortex with the thalamus. 

What do we know about the cortex? Very little. Vile do know that 
functionally l) it operates as vital generating energy - dyncu.iogenic 
activation; 2) it has differential activation; 3) delayed r eaction. From 
a colloidal point of view, there is no fundamental difference between the 
amoeba, muscle, and tho brain. Life is to bo trained whether roots, 
muscles or the nervous system. The truth is often shocking. Balance 
is to be trained between action and reaction. This applies to the ner- 
vous system. There is no such thing as norvous inhibition - the nervous 
system has no static parts, we have actually physico-chemical packages 
in us, Tho action of the nervous system is to regulate and control these, 
(ex. given of the patient who had 8 different personalities showing dis- 
cordination; ex. also of chemical memory through the story of the Jew who 
said "I was day dreaming"; have here theory of re-incarnation.) Our 
latest problems are cortical - wo harm them by false knowledge. 

(Culmination;) Ignorance can be 0. K. but false knowledge makes us un- 
happy. ~Tou know in human life how we always think that we know "all 
about ourselves"? Hero comes the tragedy. With false knowledge, the 
cortex does not protect the thalamus but adds to its troubles.

2nd lecture, 6/3 II. GENERAL SEMANTICS 

(Approach:) Last night we wore talking about different aspects of the 
nervous system. We review first about the cortex: l) it has a dynamo- 
genio effect - it generates energy, 2) it has differential activation. 
Both these statements are verbal fictions. There is a 3rd function of 
the cortex which is not a verbal fiction. This is delaye d reaction. 
In evolution every new layer of the brain has protected the lower one, 
I refer you to Koohler's experiments with pictures of apes. The reaction 
of the thalamus without delay has no relational meaning - no human value. 
Animals do not have an artificial world like we have built for ourselves, 
Realize to what extent we respond to signal reactions. Wo blow up from 
words that we dislike in childhood. We have to have sym bol reactions 
for intelligent social affairs* "What is education, politics, etc, to do? 

The personal problem is whether we have intelligence or not, I am talk- 
ing brain not political issues. What can we do about dullness and lazi- 
ness? Is it possible to clear up our human messes by scientific method? 
This is a question of the investigation of facts, not speculation, 

(Discus sion : ) There is one thing about the nervous system that cannot 
be avoided. This is canalization - Bahnung the Germans call it or 
facilitation. Canalization shows that new nervous impulses tend to 
travel the old paths or channels. There is benefit in this, also danger, 
■This mechanism makes learning possible by experience. On the human level, 
the human cortex matures only about 18, Through canalization we get an 
immature, infantile thalamic brain, What is going on in the world today - 
infantilism, immature canalization. do not have moans yet to spur 
cortex because we canalize infantile brains, 

^- n 'aV.A*^. w -°-..j laV£i found means to stimulate °ortj3X^ij"0£tly_, bring about 
"bliat maturity which physiologically is denied" us, T dr aw attention now 
to vjhat happens in science. In science when a definite error is dis- 
covered, it is dropped. Do we do this in human affairs? No, we argue, 
we arg\io endlessly. If you make an error, drop it. Nothing is wrong 
if you learn a lesson, (ox. given here of how Einstein discovered errors 
in the older Newtonian formulations so dropped them and re-formulated,) 

G. £>. deals with life. In stressing problem of evaluation, you must 
understand this for adjustment to life. Test evaluation by predict- 
ability. Scientific theory acts only if it covers old fexcts. If you 
introduce one new fact, it changes the whole operation and things happen. 
You have to verify. Is the new quantum theory crazy? No, it is the 
best we hove to date, G. S. accepts that standard for human affairs. 

Wo pass now to factors of predictability. Let us take a map (cf . p, 13)- 
something when and where you reach what. For maximum predictability, 
the map must bo similar in structure to the territory for maximum results. 
Contemplate the relation between the territory and the map. Its funda- 
mental premises arc non-A; humanity today lives under Aj science works 
with non-A premises, 

Non»A premises: 

1) Map is not the Territory - non-identity, 

2) Map is not all the T - non-allness, 

3) Map ia self reflexive. 

The old A premises give dog-matism, cat-egorics, absolutism, I refer you 



- a - 



2nd lecture, oont'n'd 7 

to Bertrand Russell on illegitimate totalities, Self-reflexiveness 
gives us a problem that has been entirely disregarded. Royce of Harvard 
discovered self-reflexiveness. This problem is one of multiordinality. 
(of. S&S, Ch. XXVTI, *section B, p. 433-42*). Self-ref lexiveness applies 
to every form of representation. It applies to language - we can talk in 
language about language. (Ex. given here through story of doctor who 
instructed a beginning medico "Always and never are 2 terms which always 
say never,") The self-reflexive problem is on the bottom of multiord- 
inality, (Ex, of how the depression began - does yes always mean yes, 
and no, no?) 

Vie have to adjust the structure of language to the structure of facts. 
Crucial to have a similarity of structure between M & T, Make an em- 
pirical investigation by observation of whether our language is similar 
in structure to facts, I recommend that you read Wittigstein who starts 
his book and ends his book with the statement, "Whereof one cannot speak, 
thereof one should be silent." Incidentally, one of the best things that 
Bertrand Russell has written is the introduction to Wittigstein' s book. 
Can you understand what the structure of language means? I am not talk- 
ing about the structure of a sentence. Stop masturbating your salivary 
glands i 

A working formula for G. S, is "I don't know, lot's see," Lot's see 
about the structure of language. Life docs not follow verbalism. Life 
has its own rules which we have to discover. The results of mathematics 
are solid; elementary arithmetic began empirically with function in it; 
this was generalized into algebra, then analysis. The human side of 
mathematics is method, not interplay of formulas. When engineers build 
a bridge do they use a language similar in structure to facts? Yes; but 
our human structures collapse because in human affairs we do not accept 
scientific method. 

Realize the terrors of language; their recurrent dramas are serious, (ex, 
given here of faces, masques, making public speeches, hospitals for the 
mentally ill,) Do you know that line from Housman: 

"I, a stranger and afraid in a world I never made"? 
I stress now that if you want to benefit from ray work follow the devices, 
in the ofd language we cannot avoid talking" non-sense, " Very well," then 
warn your hearers that you talk no; -sense, I warn you now I am about to 
talk non-sense. Lot's sec about the structure of language. 

(Ex, given here by holding up stick or cane and asking if wo could divide 
matter, space and time in it as an object; class replied no, AK said 
then - take away matter, you have no stick; take away space, you have 
only a point; take away time, you have just a flash,) These are facts: 
they are the structure of nature; they are non-elementalistic. The work 
of Einstein is revolutionary for physics because the language fits the 
facts; the language fits the structure, the process. In the living org- 
anism body-mind, emotion-intellect, etc. are interconnected. But do we 
separate them verbally? Do wo split matter, space and time verbally? 
Life is non-el, language is el; we have to adjust the structure of language 
to bo nearer the facts. 

Inspect persons and what do you find - everyone is an absolute individual; 
hero is man]_, here is human2, hero is Smithy 2, 3, etc. No verbalism 
here - facts, I introduce now 2 technical terms. Look under index of 
any book on logic for intension and extension. Terms are not nowj Aris- 
totle may have made them; anyway he know them but he never applied them, 



2nd J^t^e,_ c_on-t_ , _n|d 8 

_A d efinition by intension is one by properties* You know Plato's clas- 
sical definition of man as a fcatherless biped. It applies to everyone 
and covers no one* This kind of thing gets nowhere but to the verbal 
brink of non-sense. 

By extension j we mean the inspecting of a class of individuals made up 
or ISinith]_, Smithg, Smithg, etc, (This acts through numerical subscripts 
or indexes), (Such) extensional methods are applied only in G. S, and 
in mathematics. No mathematician is interested in the definition of a 
number for he shows the behavior of numbers. The power of mathematics 
is uncanny. It is based first on empirical operations, then verified, 
(Story here of revising the advice to Mary be good, to Mary bo careful,) 

The power of mathematics is extensional. Generalizing oomes later. 
Have facts first, then words for them. What happens to you and me is 
that we are taught language before facts. Natural order starts with 
facts and then generalizes. The reverse order is pathological. We 
hove to understand that we are trained in this pathological order. Take 
the dictionary - what does it do? Reverses bla-bla into tra-tra indef- 
initely, 

I shall now take the devices or techniques for exbensionalization in G.S. 
There aro 5: 

l) indoxing 4) using quotes 

Z) dating 5) using hyphens 

3) using etc, permanently 
I recommend that you try reading the Bible with non-A punctuation. It 
will become anew book, I point out and emphasize that you can only 
speak with security provided you date what you say. Only talk at a date 
makes sense . We need to date what we say for with new faots we need to 
revise what we scy. We have to go by facts, not only those we know per- 
sonally but those we know indirectly by science, etc. In G, S. we start 
with observing of individuals, generalizing for the time being as we need. 
Our knowledge becomes hypothetical, not dogma, (Ex, given here of the 3 
little girls investigating the box of matches - the little "beast", the 
verbalizer, and the moron, and the results of G, S« training. Ex, also 
given of the chair episode - cf, S&S, p, 424 for details - showing the 
''cussedness of the object" and the consciou sness of a bstracting,) 

When we do not use cortex we copy animals, (Ex, given hero of student 
who wrote, "Do I copy animals in my stomach reaction? Do I copy animals 
in my nervous system? If you say yes, it will make no sense to me," And 
ATK's answer. Diagram of this ex, may be found in S&S outline by aK in 
G, S, Congress Re-prints, Arrow Editions, 444 Madison Av,, N, Y. j 

Indexes and dates have to do with timing. Physically you have grasped 
the cortex. You have dono this automatically for by indexing and dating 
you have delayed your reactions. This is how direct neurological train- 
ing in G. S« works. Another thing of importance is that mathematics 
finds similarities in differences and differences in similarities, I 
recommend to those interested in this you read Sylvanus Thompson's little 
book on Calculus Made Easy, v'.hen wo index and date, we get a new orien- 
tation. Learn to do this permanently in your heads. It makes us cau- 
tious because we deal with realities. 

The use of indexes leads to etc, Non-A punctuation to avoid repetition 
of this is ,, Etc, helps us get away from the allneSs, I call indexes,

siblc; -we have to use them; warn your hearer then the term is irrespon- 
sible by using quotes - 'thinking' for example. Hyphens help us estab- 
lish relations; make non-el terms out of el ones* (For the explanation 
of the principles upon which these devices are based, students are refer- 
red to che index of S&S for the specific sections that treat of allness 
and non-allness, circularity of knowledge, identification, multiordinality, 
etc., and especially to Book II, Ch, XXIV-VTI, p. 371-451, *the process 
of abstracting*). 

Those devices have to do with the consciousness of abstracting. They 
bring us to a nat ur a 1_ or d e r of e v a 1 u at ion . (Ex, given here of a disk, 
manufactured by the lower nervous"" centers; ex. also given of the thalai.ins 
acting like a motion-picture film, and the cortex (in connection with 
words) like the little static images seen when one stops the film. Fur- 
ther ex, given of ascribing blueness to object - cover of pamphlet hang- 
ing on wall - when the evaluation is a process; this implies relations. 
Mathematics expresses what is there (pointing) and what is here (pointing) 
by equations. The tensor calculus rives us the equation of a relation 
that is absolutely - and we mean just that; the tensor calculus is often 
called the absolute calculus - workable. The formula goes A/3:l. 

(Culmination: ) We can now introduce real mathematics into personality 
study, not just numerical data like the I. Q, We begin too to understand 
something about brain waves. But it is too late now to go into that. 
What all this means is that we have to bring up our orientation to the level 
of the world wc now live in.

3rd lecture, 6/4 III, GENERAL SEMANTICS 

(^£EL°i''£il : ) •*• nee< i bo remind you of the relation between the map and 
the territory; also that predictability is the proper test for evalu- 
ation, Most of what I am telling you is based on the revolution in 
science that has been going on the last 50 to 80 years. In the old 
ways, we had positive and negative. Me interpreted positive as some- 
thing desirable, negative undesirable. Today this is reversed. The 
only scientific results are negative, i.e, hypothetical. The negative 
becomes fundamental} the old cannot exist, ..e are sharpening our orien- 
tations, getting closer to facts. The premises of G. S, are negative} 
we learn about the world when we know it is not so, (Story of Hark 
Twain and mind and matter, "7/hat is matter - never mind, .mat is 
mind? - it doesn't matter] "), 

( Discuss ion ; ) We pass now to a simplified theory of matter. The atom 
is the core of the electron. Electronic structures cannot be seenj they 
are inferred (sub-microscopic level), (Use of blades again which when 
rotcited produce object called disk to emphasize how the nervous system 
creates 'what is labelled disk.) Eddington gives an interesting example 
of the process we call matter. It is of a cathedral being like a swam 
of fast-moving fire-flies. There are really no walls but you can't get 
out because electrons are there, 

knowing may b e timing , :,:ion you have a knowing about knowing, this is 
a higher order of abstraction} this is the human level. In laboratories 
we produce daily elements not made by nature; man adds cortical work to 
the work of nature,, , , Ford has no humanity in him despite his senti- 
mentality ... (Story here of pigeons to show structure of modern sci- 
ence, based on inferential data.) All lines in science have to converge. 
Geometrical intuition is thalamic, creative. Verity bjr analyses etc, 
are cortical, Thoro is no why about 1st order facts} accept 1st order 
facts on their face value, 1st order facts cannot be explained although 
wo may try to understand them. We have to depend on undefined terras. 
Mathematics accepts that. For example, you have a pain, no matter what 
you say about the pain, because you are speaking on verbal level, it is 
not the pain, Whatever you say about an object, is not the thing. There 
are unspeakable, silent levels, (^JL blew smoke-clouds here to illustrate) 
There are objective, yet non-verbal, levels} also inner feeling levels. 

Colloids are very important. Inorganic colloids produce geometrical 
forms, Where is that source of energy that makes colloids possible? 
Fundamental energies of the world: l) working of electricity - electrical 
energy pulls forces apart, 2) surface energy pulls them to got her. Think 
about yourselves, "nhatcvcr you do is registered in the nervous system. 
You will bo more carciul about what you do. Understand yourself as a 
colloidal jazz, i,e, electro-colloidal dynamic configurations, (cf, S&S, 
Ch, IX, *p,i21* for summary on colloidal behavior). This explains how 
shock therapy works, also G. S, Mctrasol is colloidal, insulin like- 
wise. Some of the upheavals are a pitiful sight, A 1 to 1 correspond- 
ence is colloidal. This gives an infinite-valued or multi-valued orien- 
tation as science has. The old A orientation is 2-way, just either-or. 
It won't work in our present world. Nothing in the world is 100% — 
unless a 100% .amoricanj This means statistical averages - a different 
orientation from aline ss - they give maxumim probability. 

Adult infantilism is a stop toward domentia praeeox, (Ex, here of stu- 
dent who wrote wanting to help a friend who first began to act strange by

sitting on floor and tearing up bits of paper, then became promiscuous, 
and next went to a woman living across the street and said "Do not worry 
any more, Mrs. Jones • I mil never sleep with your husband again." The 
facts wore she had never done so, AK advised his student that she could 
not help hor friend; the colloids wore too far dispersed. (low friend 
is locked up for good.) >.e arc paying more attention to the effect of 
the weather on medical cases. I advise you to read Peterson on this, 
(Ex. hero of the differences in Lincoln and Douglas, one lean, thin, tall 
and the other stout and short and their reactions to weather,) 

Get into your heads that we live in a process-world. Levels become 
important. The world of objects is macro scopic, what we see by ohe 
naked oyej the micro scopic level is what we can see through instruments} 
the _sub-microscopic *is inferred. We call this last level in the natural 
order of evaluation a series of events. Complications in higher orders 
of abstracting proceed by geometric ratio. This is what wo get in life, 
'when you have a mechanism that acts for an indefinite number of possibil- 
ities then you have something that works oven when details are not known, 
when we view everything as a 1st order fact, wo get surprises. 

Humans have electrical reactions to life. They are electrical reactions 
of life. The psychogalvanomotcr shows this, also their frustrations. 
It shows 1) word s have ele ctrical e ffects , 2;tho verbal report is never 
true to the organismal response. Language has electro-colloidal effects 
so language becomes a branch of natural science, words kill and words 
cure, (Story her<- on you are talking to the .nlmighty. ) 

Language is one of the means of rc-oricntation. Results of brain-wave 
study show that even though men have benefitted by psycho-analysis, the 
length of the brain-wave does not change. Many people 'think' there is 
something mysterious about dimensions. Get that out of your heads. 
Dimension merely means the number of factors you have to know before 
you can know something. The 4th dimensional world is static, (cf, S&S, 
Ch, XXXVIII. *p. 671-72*). 

The natural order of evaluation is based on asymmetrical relations. 
(Brief demonstration here with the Structural Differential, cf, S&S, 
p. 393,398, 414, 427 for diagrams and detailed t cxt). The S. D. is a 
diagram of a process. It shows the event is more important than the 
object, the object is more important then the label or description, the 
description is more important than a lower order inference, a lower order 
inference is more important than a higher order inference, oto«, etc. 
Wo are speaking and living by going up end down all the time mixing these 
levels. If you miss the lovel of your abstracting in a serious problem, 
you cannot solve it. 

Use your hands j this is v.:ry important in practice. You are working to 
order your reactions; this gives you delayed reactions. There are all 
kinds of mosses and fictions you have to clear up. Take the fiction 
hate-father, hate-mother. Very well allocate the hate, then dote and 
you eliminate. Politics moke use of generalizing language; as such is 
fiction. Nouro-lingui sties are facts, not fiction. The S. D,, shows 
the premises of G. S, and the devices. These supplement each other. The 
S, D, translates the premises and the devices. 

All existing art has thalamic appeal v/hich, if high art, works bettor 
then science sometimes. Poetry and literature in general involve thal- 
amic factors. The S. D. is a thalamic affair. Realize the difference

betwoen signal reactions and symbol-evaluation. The bottom of our dif- 
ficulties is that signal reactions are not fully human. We are detl ing 
with multiordinal mechanisms - these are natural to language. When wo 
stop abstracting, we copy animals, abstracting is the dynamic character- 
istic of humanity* Test it J I give in my book quite a list of multi- 
ordinal terms such as yes-no; true-false; fact-reality; love-hate; etc. 
They have no content outside of a specific context. The multiordinal ity 
of fact and reality acts as a key for psychiatry. 

Take some examples: You may have doubt; this is 1st order. If you doubt 
the doubt, you have 2nd order - scientific criticism. Knowing about 
knowing is 2nd order. Passing to the 2nd order introduces beneficial 
effects instead of the harmful 1st order ones. Sex of the 1st order is 
quite different from sex of the 2nd order, 1st order sex is enjoyment; 
2nd order sex enjoyment of the enjoyment. If you have the 2nd order, 
can you be promiscuous? Promiscuity splits women. It is interesting 
that women remember the worst of their lovers, men the best of them. 

Facts always have thalamic components. Study the section in my book on 
abstracting and the one on multiordinal ity. An understanding of multi- 
ordinality provides help for women during change of life, M, 0. terms 
are at the core of human destructive action, also desperate action. 
Consciousnes s of the mec hanism does the work . The m echanism inns_t_ be_ 
formulated i n a th alamic way , I repeat performance of or for sex is not 
a cure, Consciousness of the mechanism is a cure, 

(Cujjiina tion : ) I shall close by giving you an extensional theory of 
happiness, " I diagram a circle, quite large, with a big E; then a very 
small circle with a smail c, and then a middle-size with an F» This 
stands for fact. Regardless of the fact, most people have expectation 
with a big E, I advise you in life to oxpect nothing with a big E, 
Expect with a small o. Expect no tiling in life without beating; also do 
not expect anything after boating. If the facts turn out better than 
you expect, you will be happy. If they do not turn out, you will not be 
unhappy. By extension we deal with living beings, not with definitions 
and intension, A theory of happiness is not new; what is new is training 
for minimum expectation. The results are different from when you start 
with a big E: without boating or with beating, you can face facts and 
adjust yourself to them.

Point (per comp.) 

The style of punctuation used in this ms. warrants explaining, AK 
lectures extensionally, i. e. ho shows . He acts a great deal and delib- 
erately. It is impossible to record these facts of communication on the 
printed page. The nearest hint that could be employed was punctu ation 
fo r timing , e. g. ; for longer than , and shorter than , and - for more 
undefined pausing. 

If students will road these notes with this in mind, it may help 
them recall many characteristics of the living communication or 1st order 
omitted by ms. Some will then perhaps re-vitalize for themselves some- 
thing akin to the weight yet playfulness of the original presentation. 

Probably half of the actual pro sent at ion- time was used in the giving 
of examples. These have been indicated rather than described for 2 rea- 
sons: l) Examples presented extonsionally are the most difficult thing to 
record' in- words^ they need pictures; 2) it seemed wise to emphasize for 
students something of the content and connections of G« S. training, i.e. 
structure and function as far as possible.

Synopsis of 6/3 a.m. talk GENERAL SEMANTICS 

Donald McLean, Chairman AND PSYCHOTHERAPY 

(Approach:) In_ G. S, wo aro more inter ested in prevention th a n o.ure » 
In training with G« 8, from bur childhood wo find that psychic trauma 
becomes impossible, Ono of our crucial problems is canalization . . • 
our troubles are thalamic • • • the pictures stay put that we learn in 
childhood, I deal only with students; you deal as psychiatrists with 
patients* It does not matter what mechanism you give your patients; it 
will work if you give them a mechanism to work out, 

(Di soussion i) We are passing from old credos . , « Promiscuity, we know, 
is not good" for men; it is definitely harmful for women. Talk in_terms 
of pvalu/tipn; lack of evaluation is evaluation of a low order. Evalu- 
ation can h~ negative or positive. You have to understand that you are 
dealing with multiordinal mechanisms. 

In G. S, the general problem has extreme simplicity of approach. We 
grant 90% of Freud but his technique is useless. The methods of Freud 
are fact-finding, e.g. 90% of human beings show masturbation. What is 
your main difficulty? Masturbation, we know, is infantile; it is anti- 
biological. 

What we don't understand about sex is that 90% of the energy of the 
gonads can and should revitalize the entire nervous system; 10% go for 
sex of the 1st order - reproduction. Idiots and bitches • , , (ex, 
given here of intercourse between an idiot and a bitch with comment on 
the bitch's biological hopelessness and the idiot's human shame lessness,) 
I have learned that physiological tickling is not sex. It takes bio- 
logical sex to be sex. Infants with tassels and infants with holes don't 
know this. 

To talk by example involves the thalamic character of communi c ation, not 
H oTinition . Factors involved arc thalamic factors; you can vis ualiz e 

them. Order is also thalamic, kinesthetic. In general psychotherapy, 
have to consider talk, As example take some water - the cortex - with 
chalk - the thalamus. The chalk represents the affective components; 
the water the verbal ones. Can you mix talk without sediment? 

Our attitude is colloidal. Dementia praocox and infants have over-disp- 
ersed colloids. Words have cioctrical effects; this makes psychotherapy 
crucial. You have to understand you r.rc working with electro-colloidal - 
dynamic-configurations . . . The cortex has one function that is not a 
fiction - delayed reacti on. This can be brought about automatically. 
Pinch your finger J what you say of a pinch is not what you experience; 
this is on a silent, unspeakable level. We have to got very straight 
how the word is not the thing. 

We are up against signal-reflex reactions; a symbol reaction has evalu- 
ation. iJLl psychoses and neuroses involvo signal reactions, (Ex, of 
the Lithuanian who never spoke and hardly moved and who on being shown 
iJv as a Pole suddenly struck him. ) 

The consciousness of abstracting applies endlessly, I worked 6 months 
in a criminal ward of a Federal institution. There was much hate there - 
the majority were mutilating and ruthlc ss murderers. Yet human energies 
have limits. If you have only hate, nothing works. When you have a 
positive theory (G. S. ) you can use semantic shock which is colloidal. 

- 15 - 



PsychothorajgjTj cont 'n'd 16 

This is how even insulin works in some cases. In passing to a higher 
order of abstracting you then can got a hate of hate. 

Do not know what to do with manic-doprcssivenoss . . » The premises of 
G. S, are more close to facts than the old ones. My opinion about 
paranoia is that it's not hcriditax-y biology but environmental biology. 
You know how paranoics can talk; do you know the story of the one who 
said: "What can a psychiatrist do for me? I can always out-talk themj" 
Paranoics arc extremely intcnsional; they associate words with -words 
without limit. Have to work to cxtonsionalize them. 

The hysterical mechanisms do exist for projection , . • point here, why 
not project useful stuff? We mistreat ourselves and others continually 
through false knowledge , . . remember humans are very complex* men are 
more than little drops of vinegar.* You can use a mirror with dementia 
praoooxj t toy like it and it is helpful, but never use a mirror with a 
manic-depressive; he can't stand it. 

Make use of the extensional devices; make use of the hands. These things 
work • . . Wo have a lot of false knowledge about homosexuality, a most 
stubborn form of infantilism . . , realize that homosexuality is not 

burbation; that anatomy does not matter; and that performance is not 
sex. 

Stuttering has no one general cause. It acts as a thalamic disturbance 
of some kind resulting from some painful experience. Treatment for 
stuttering connects with relaxation; also here, as elsewhere, we have to 
develop a general freedom of symbols, working toward full conditionally, 
(cf, S&S, Ch. XXI, XXII, XXIII, p. 326-365.) 

( Culmination : ) (demonstration given here), hand has to bo extremely 
soft; men to strip to waist; women can have a light slip on; everything 
that affects blood pressure has to be removed. The principle is that 
the thalamus controls blood pressure. ..hen we get hurt in childhood, 
this remains on level of organismic memory in consciousness, nandle 
yourself; you will be gentle with yourself; no massage, no petting; get 
the i feeling of yourself , i, c, verify yourself; shako your soli up and 
down a little j do no talking. Men havo defense in arms; women have 
defense in stomach. Life is bewildering; wo are put on the defensive 
but being on the defensive is no defense ... Results are reached when 
relaxation remains permanent, (*cf, bibliography re monograph jfl, in 
which, p. 46-8, details are given for neuro- semantic relaxation*), 

Comp, note: The Neurotic Personality of our Time, and 
New Lays of Psycho-analysis, both by Dr. 
Karen Horney, are worth reading. 



Synopsis of 6/4 a.m. talk GENERii SEMANTICS 

Dr. Lowell C. Frost, Chairman iiND EDUCATION 

(Agproaoh:) The problem of education is one about isihich we have fooled 
ouVseTves since the beginning of mankind. Schooling means little. From 
the moment a child is born he i s being educated, Neuro-seiuantic factors 
are at work, and particularly neuro-linguistic s.r. as human environments 
are verbal ones. Educational environments of some kind cannot be avoid- 
ed; likewise the problem of adjustment at some level. Train the child 
then from a life point of view: e xtensio n. Education in te rms of verb - 
■Pi-J-A?.? 1 - J; , G _ S nolTTace facts . Knowledge i~s m ath emat ical in character. 

The approach of G. S, shovra when we face a situation we find a solution. 
.ijiy child can solve an equation of the 1st order, Galois proved that 
above the 5th order equations could not be solved by algebra. Today vre 
have the theory of groups by which we can solve any equation, (cf. S&S, 
Oh, XIX, *section C, p, 280-87* for theory of invariance, transformations, 
etc.) We discover f a cts to begin with if facts are unknown . Ex, of the 
new quantum mechanics through which we now know that waves travel but 
electrons do not, (cf, S&S, Ch, XLI, *scctions E, F. G. p. 714-28 for 
details.) Solving problems is a question of human ingenuity, not an 
Almighty alibi. To talk with security trices facts; talk all you went 
but know when you talk whether you have the facts or not* 

(Pi sous si on ; ) I stress the G. S. interpretation is flexible yet matter- 
of-fact* , , Our difficulties ore always the seme. We start with a gen- 
erality, Ex. of chair]_, an object and chairg the label, noise or defin- 
ition (and showing how we never sit on a definition,) G. S, overlaps 
education and psychiatry. In any case its results come from extension. 
We may view all education as a generalized psychiatry. If you treat ed- 
ucation on verbal levels only, you have trouble, (ex, given of levels of 
abstracting orders of democracy, ) AL1 talk is b un k witho ut an index and 
a da te. In modern science we begin 'with limitations, ~ Me d*o look for 
generalities but these come after the single instances ... Language 
originally had an extensional origin. Law, Roman Catholic doctrine and 
a host of other things reverses with precedents and codes the original 
operations of language. We are taught to learn a great deal of verbiage 
1st before wo learn or experience the actual facts. From such training 
we get endless arguments. Extension discovers and then orders facts for 
us; agreement becomes possible; wc don't mistake noises for things or 
processes. 

Distinguish between words and noises , A word has to be a symbol, not a 
signal. There is nothing to be known about noises or spell-marks ... 
I refer you to the chapter on infinity in my book, (cf, S&S, Ch. XIV, 
p* 204.) Clear up verbal messes; don't legislate. 

I take up in my book the operations of extensional analysis or living 
facts, (Ex, of question, "Do you believe in G-o-d?" with a showing of 
how G-o-d is a noise out there - by pointing - and a symbol here inside 
breast - pointing.) ^ chi ld should knovf the relations of words to facts. 
If you allocate G-o-d as a symbol inside, there is no quarrel; I" have 
nothing to say, Allocate the symbol; find where it belongs* Dogmatic 
Ifnoories then disappear. The Hindus and the Chinese have no fiction 
about God but recipes for wisdom, fineness and ethics, 

Quc_s_-bi_o_n asked here: When a symbol is allocated within, does it remain 

thalamic? 



- 17 - 



Education, oont'n' d 18 

Answer by AX: If it is your creed, it involves thalamic factors, God 
lias" no thalamic factors for many but what I say about God has. 

Another fundamental issue which has been completely neglected is how some 
words, many words have multi o rdinal meanings . You can read about this 
in my book, (cf, S&S, Ch. jQWl, *section B, p, 433-42*) there is not time 
now to go into it. Science depends upon terminology, special terms. We 
know in G, S, how elementalistic terms split facts j we select then non-el 
terms deliberately. They mean the dfference between speculations and 
structural assumptions • « , The problem of structural assumptions behind 
terms makes every difference in orientation* (Ex. given of structural key 
terms used in G, S, - order, structure, function, relations, extension, 
evaluation, etc,, etc,) Structure in general can be defined in terms of 
relations. Tell child what terms in language are relationa l. 

The revolution on which most of what I am telling you is based is already 
80 years old; it marks the passing from the objective level to the process 
level. Remember the disk' Now we deal with macroscopic, microscopic, 
and sub-microscopic levels. Sense data are extremely important for sur- 
vival value, (ex, of "blue" as a projected neurological process and 
showing how such projected mechanisms go on into hysteria,) Animals are 
adjusted entirely for survival value on their level. Our human levels 
already have great danger for in all mental illness, you have delusions, 
i,e, a refinement of projected mechanisms, 

rte may use language as we do today but the salvation of the child depends 
" U P. J\ Jffl. °74 n S what we are doing when we use language . We faTsify facts 
every time we use the i s of identity . Realize what language means today - 
the English and Americans have literally made Hitler by words - more dyna- 
mite than anything else. Psychotherapy brings people back to life just 
by language. Such implications for education lead far into the field of 
insanity and adjustment, 

( Culm inat ion ; ) G» S, aims in education include: - and I can't go into 
detail - l) Elimination of false knowledge systematically; the structure 
of lang uage involves false knowledge ; the child should be warned false 
knowledge is being taught him by and through our very teaching methods, 
2) Children are born extensional; we ruin them by education; the dynamic 
character of a processworld requires an infinite-valued orientation, 
o) Passing from dynamic to static is difficult, so be taught child early; 
remember any dimension shows how many factors you have to know before you 
can know something; ("ex, of Newtonian and non-Newtonian explanations,) 
4) Teaching generally of the elementary data of physics and physiology, 
also of electricity and the colloids, and finally the emphasizing of the 
coordination of cortical with thalamic reactions and vice versa.
