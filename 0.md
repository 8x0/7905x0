(6 AT my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people , but those 
IX who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality They beheld me 
with all the marks and circumstances of wonder, "either, indeed, 
was I much in their debt , having never, till then, seen a race of mortals so 
, singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances Their heads were all 
reclined either to the right or the left , one of their eyes turned inward, and 
the other directly up to the zenith Their outward garments were adorned 
with the figures of suns, moons, and stars, interwoven with those of fiddles, 
flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsicords, and many other instruments 
of music, unknown to us in Europe I observed, here and there, many m 
the habit of servants, with a blown bladder fastened like a flail to the end 
of a short stick, which they carried in their hands In each bladder was a 
small quantity of dried pease, or little pebbles (as I was afterwards in- 
formed) With these bladders they now and then flapped the mouths and 
ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could not then con- 
ceive the meaning , it seems, the minds of these people are so taken up with 
intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the dis- 
courses of others, without being roused by some external taction upon the 
organs of speech and hearing, for which reason, those persons, who are 
able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is dtmenole) m their 
family, as one of their domestics, nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, 
without him And the business of this officer is, when two or three more 
persons are in company, gently to strike witli his bladder the mouth of him 
who is to speak, and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker 
addresseth himself This flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend 
his master in his walks, and, upon occasion, to give him a soft flap on his 
eyes, because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in mani- 
fest danger of falling down every precipice, and bouncing his head against 
every post, and in the streets, of jostling others, or being jostled himself, 
into the kennel 

It was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he 
would be at the same loss with me, to understand the proceedings of these 
people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and from 
thence to the royal palace While we were ascending, they forgot several 
times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories were 
again roused by their flappers, for they appeared altogether unmoved by 
the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of the 
vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged 

And although they are dextrous enough upon a piece of paper in 
the management of the rule, the pencil, and the divider, yet, in the common 
Wtions and behaviour of life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, 
^iid unhandy people, nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon 
all other subjects, except those of mathematics and music They are very 
bad reasoners, and vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen 
to be of the right opinion, which is seldom their case Imagination, fancy, 
and invention they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their 
language by which those ideas can be expressed , the whole compass of their 
thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences ”

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 

1941 


There is what may perhaps be called the method of optimism, which 
leads us either willfully or instinctively to shut our eyes to the possibility 
of evil Thus the optimist who treats a problem in algebra or analytic 
geometry will say, if he stops to reflect on what he is doing T know that 1 
have no right to divide by zero , but there are so many other values which 
the expression by which I am dividing might have that I will assume that 
the Evil One has not thrown a zero m my denominator this time ’

Section A Recent developments and the founding of the Institute of 
General Semantics. 

Science and Sanity An Introduction to N on-aristotelian Systems 
and General Semantics, first published in October, 1933, was intended to 
be a textbook showing how in modern scientific methods we can find 
factors of sanity, to be tested empirically Although a great many scien- 
tific discoveiies have been made since the first publication, it did not seem 
necessary to revise the text for this second edition because the method- 
ological data given, important for our purpose, have not changed How- 
ever, the list of books in preparation for the Non-aristotelian Library 
has been revised, and m this introduction I indicate some new develop- 
ments in general semantics and include a short new bibliography, supple- 
menting the bibliography of 619 titles given on page 767 ff 

In 1935 I began to conduct seminar courses in general semantics m 
schools, colleges and universities, and before various groups of edu- 
cators,** scientists, and physicians, including psychiatrists. In the same 
year a group of students of Science and Sanity organized the First Anier- 

Coiujrcss of .-Ills and Science, St Louis, 1904. Vol I, p 4/2 
** I use the word ‘educator’ in its standard English sense , namely, ‘one who or 
that which educates’ I use ‘educate’ in the sense of ‘to rear bring up from 
childhood, so as to form habits, manners, mental and physical aptitudes To 
provide schooling for tram generally tram so as to develop some special 
aptitude, taste, or disposition’ Etc (The Shoiter Oxfoid English Diclwnaiy on 
Historical Principles, Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1933 ) In this sense any 
teacher from nursery school through university professors are ‘educators’ From a 
hfe point of view this would include even parents, nurses, etc 



vi INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 

lean Congress on General Semantics at the Washington College of Edu- 
cation at Ellensburg, where a number of papers from various fields were 
presented. The present writer delivered three addresses on the applica- 
tion of general semantics to education and medicine, which are printed 
in the proceedings of the Congress * The Second American Congress 
on General Semantics will be held at the University of Denver m August, 
1941. This Congress is organized by Professor Elwood Murray of the 
iTiiiversity and M Kendig, Educational Director of the Institute 

In 1938 the Institute of General Semantics was incorporated in Chi- 
cago for neuro-linguistic, neuro-epistemologic, scientific research and 
education Since that date, as director of the Institute, my major efforts 
have been concentrated on further research and co-ordmation of rapidly 
accumulating empirical data, along with the conduct of seminar courses 
to tram in the new extensional methods for application m personal adjust- 
ment, and in the respective speaal fields of the students At present 
several universities are offering accredited courses in general semantics, 
and in a number of other universities and colleges general semantics is 
incorporated in the presentation of other courses 

From scientific necessity this book was written inductively ; the semi- 
nar courses are presented deductively, and so the two complement each 
other The seminars include much illustrative empirical material accu- 
mulated in the five years of application of the system by my co-workers 
and myself, together with the pertinent, factual, newest findings of other 
sciences 

The non-aristotelian system presented here has turned out to be a 
strictly empirical science, as predicted, with results which have greatly 
surpassed even my expectations General semantics is not any ‘philos- 
ophy’, or ‘psychology’, or ‘logic’, in the ordinary sense. It is a new 
extensional discipline which explains and trams us how to use our ner- 
vous systems most efficiently It is not a medical science, but like bac- 
teriology, It is indispensable for medicine in general, and for psychiatry, 
mental hygiene, and education m particular In brief, it is the formula- 
tion of a new non-aristotehan system** of orientation which affects every

branch of science and life The separate issues involved are not entirely 
new, their methodological formulation as a system which is workable, 
teachable and so elementary that it can be applied by children, is entirely 
new 

The experience of my co-workers, mostly educators and psychiatrists, 
and my oun, shows that about ninety per cent of those who train them- 
selves seriously in the new extensional methods definitely benefit mi 
various degrees, and in ways so varied as to be unpredictable 

Theory and empirical results show that these new methods involve 
psychosomatic factors which help the balancing and integration of the 
functions of the nervous system, while the prevalent and traditional in- 
tensional methods of evaluation tend to disintegrate these functions The 
nervous mechanisms involved work automatically one way or another, 
harmfully or beneficially, depending on the methods with which we utilize 
them This has not been fully realized before 

The new methods eliminate or alleviate different semantogenic block- 
ages, many ‘emotional disturbances’, including even some neuroses and 
psychoses, various learning, reading, or speech difficulties, etc.; and 
general maladjustments in professional and/or personal lives These 
difficulties result to a large extent from the failure to use ‘intelligence’ 
adequately so as to bring about proper evaluation 

It IS well known that many psychosomatic symptoms such as some 
heart, digestive, respiratory, and ‘sex’ disorders, some chronic j’oint dis- 
eases, arthritis, dental caries, migraines, skin diseases, alcoholism, etc , to 
mention a few, have a semantogenic, and therefore neuro-semantic and 
neuro-lmguistic origin In general semantic training we do not go into 
the medical angle as such. We eliminate the harmful semantogenic 
factors, and m most cases the corresponding symptoms disappear — ^pro- 
vided the student is willing to work at himself seriously.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


working of their own nervous systems For most of them it is only 
tached verbal ism such as we often find in hospitals for ‘mentally’ ill For 
instance, a very gifted, well-minded mathematician and professor of ‘phi- 
losophy’ wrote to me ‘I do not, however, think that neuro-psychology is 
relevant to the analysis of the nature of meaning . . I do not believe 
in confusing logic with neuro-psychology’ These professionals would be 
shocked if they would study the many volumes of verbal rationalizations 
by patients in hospitals They would find very quickly that the words 
interplay ^\lth the other words somehow, but they have very little, if any, 
connection with the facts, and that is one reason why the patients are con- 
fined Why speculate on academic verbal definitions instead of investi- 
gating facts in such hospitals, where patients also pay no attention to the 
functioning of their own nervous systems? Even a gramophone record 
undergoes some physical changes before words or noises can be ‘stored’ 
and/or reproduced Is it so very difficult to understand that the extremely 
sensitive and highly complex human nervous system also undergoes some 
electro-colloidal changes before words, evaluations, etc , are stored, pro- 
duced, or reproduced? In the work of general semantics we deal with 
the living «ei(ro-semantic and «e«ro-hnguistic reacbons, not mere de- 
tached verbal chatter in the abstract In our experience we have found 
that even seriously maladjusted persons benefit considerably if we can 
succeed in making them ‘think’ about themselves in neurological electro- 
colloidal terms (see chapter IX) 

Most ‘philosophers’ who reviewed this book made particularly shock- 
ing performances A\ erage intelligent readers can understand this book, 
as they usually have some contact with life It is not so with those who 
indulge in mere verbalism I can give here only a classical example of 
some ‘philosophical’ performances A revieuer in the Journal of Philos- 
ophy, February 1, 1934, writes 

‘Except for his stimulating discussion of the mathematical infinite 
(p 206) and his hints on the nature of theory (p 253), he contributes 
nothing to the clarification of meanings by definite analyses of special 
problems Indeed, he only adds to the confusion when he declares that 
hypotheses contrary to the fact are meaningless (e g , p 168) , if his views 
11 ere correct, science ii ould come to an end His theory of meaning, like 
his theory of social causation, is very naive, to say the least ’ 

I suggest that the reader verify whether on page 168 there is such a 
statement, or even a hint at such a notion, which I could not possibly have 
Besides, I do not give any theories of ‘meaning’ or of ‘social causation’ ' 

Most ‘philosophers’, ‘logicians’, and even mathe, 'aticians look at this 
non-aristotehan system of evaluation as some system of formal non-aris-

totelian ‘logic’, which is not the case They are somehow not able to take 
the natural science point of view that all science, mathematics, 'logic', 
‘philosophy’, etc , are the product of the functioning of the human nervous 
system, involving some sort of internal orientations, or evaluations, which 
are not necessarily formalized. The analysis of such living reactions is 
the sole object of general semantics as a natural empirical science. 

These ‘philosophers’, etc , seem unaware, to give a single example, 
tliat by teaching and preaching ‘identity’, which is empirically non-existent" 
in this actual world, they are neurologically training future generations in 
the pathological identifications found m the ‘mentally’ ill or maladjusted 
As explained on page 409, and^also Chapter XXVI, whatever we mayj 
say an object 'is’, it is not, because the statement is verbal, and the facts 
are not 

It IS pathetic, if not tragic, that society should invest millions of dol- 
lars to support such specialists who train future generations in malad- 
justments just because they disregard the unavoidable neuro-linguistic 
and neuro-semantic effects of their teachings on the lives of their pupils 

Most scientists and educators are either entirely innocent of these 
problems, or indifferent and passive, or even negativistic Like some 
animals that can outwit humans because of their keen observations, the 
cunning, often pathological, thoioughly ignorant present day totalitarian 
leaders are not unaware of the academic shortcomings based on inertia, 
verbalism, etc , and openly proceed to utilize these human nervous weak- 
nesses destructively, with very telling results Nazism, wars 0 / and on 
nerves, wars of verbal distortion, etc , with their following disasters are 
in 1941 only too obvious examples. I will return to this subject at the 
end of this introduction 

The terms ‘philosophy’, ‘system’, etc , as ordinarily used, stand for 
too bioad generalizations Different ‘philosophies’ repiesent nothing but 

methods of evaluation, which may lead to 
empirical mis-evaluation if science and 
empirical facts are disregarded Different 
systems may be very broad and general, 
such as, say, the aristotelian system (A) 
(see Fig 1), within which is a more lim- 
ited and less general system such as 
‘Christianity’ (C), within which is, for 
instance, the leibnitzian system (L), and 
within which there are individual, per- 
sonal systems (P). Every Smithi has an

system of Ins own As a rule, personal systems are a part of, and in- 
fluenced by, larger systems, which in turn are influenced by still more 
general systems Such problems can be handled at present only by the 
methods of general semantics and by topological methods * 

‘Mental’ illness and every form of maladjustment are to be considered 
as mis-evaluations, involving some ‘philosophies’, public or individual, 
one w'lthin the other, as usual ‘Philosophers’, etc , who wish to become 
aware of such dangers, would do well to study the verbalizations and 
mis-evaluations of the ‘mentally’ ill in hospitals 

2 PERPLEXITIES IN THEORIES OF ‘MEANING’ 

« 

There is a fundamental confusion between the notion of the older 
‘semantics’ as connected with a theory of verbal ‘meaning’ and words de- 
fined by words, and the present theory of ‘general semantics’ where we 
deal only with «e«ro-semanttc and newro-linguistic hvmg reactions of 
Smithj, Smiths, etc , as their reactions to neuro-semantic and neuro-lin- 
guistic environments as environment 

The present day theories of ‘meaning’ are extremely confused and 
difficult, ultimately hopeless, and probably harmful to the sanity of the 
human race Of late in the United States some members of the progres- 
sive education movement have written much on ‘referents’ and ‘opera- 
tional’ methods, in the abstract, based on verbalism Let us consider 
some facts, and how the theories of referents and operational methods fit 
human evaluations. Here is, for instance, Smithi who, through family, 
social, economic, political, etc , conditions has become ‘insane’ Smithi 
finally, in ordinary parlance, kills Smithj From a human point of view 
it is a veiy complex and tragic situation Let us account for it in terms of 
referents and operations The body and the heart of Smiths, the hand of 
Smiths, the knife, etc , are perfectly good referents The grabbing of the 
knife by Smiths and plunging it m the heart of Smiths, the falling down 
on the ground by Smith, and the kicking of Ins legs are perfectly good 
operations However, where is hitman evaluation^ Where is concern 
with ‘sanity’ and ‘insanity’^ Here we deal with some of the deepest 
human and social tragedies which, in this case, involve not only the killing 
of Smiths by Smiths, but the sick, unhappy, twisted life of Smiths, affect- 
ing all his life connections, and with which we must be concerned if we 
are to be human beings and different from apes

Such an example is of course extreme and over-simplified, although 
It illustrates the principles Howevei, offiLially teaching such methods 
which are inadequate to handle evaluation, and so human values, has a 
definite sinister effect, among others, on the ‘sex’ life of the students. 
Many of them are taught to orient themselves generally by referents and 
operations only , and so mere physiological performance is often identified 
with mature love life, etc , and is a causative factor in the wide-spread 
marital unhappiness, promiscuity and other lowerings of human cultural 
and ethical standards. 

Thus, theories of ‘meaning’ or still worse, ‘meaning of meaning’, based 
on ‘referents’ and ‘operational' -methods are thoroughly inadequate to 
account for human values, yet they do affect the nervous systems of 
humans We must, therefore, work out a theory of evaluation which is 
based on the optimum electro-colloidal action and reaction of the nervous 
S3'Stem 

There is no doubt that a civilized societ)'^ needs some mature ‘morals’, 
‘ethics’, etc In a general theory of evaluation and sanity we must con- 
sider seriously such problems, if w e are to be sane humans at all. Theory 
and practice show that healthy, well-balanced people ai e naturally ‘moral’ 
and ‘ethical’, unless their educations have twisted their types of evalua- 
tions In general semantics we do not ‘pi each’ ‘morality’ or ‘ethics’ as 
such, but we tram students m consciousness of abstracting, consciousness 
of the multiordmal mechanisms of evaluation, relational orientations, etc , 
which bring about cortico-thalamic integration, and then as a result ‘mor- 
ality’, ‘ethics’, awareness of social responsibilities, etc , follow automati- 
cally Unfortunately our educational systems are unaw’are of, or even 
negativistic toward, such newro-seniantic and neio-o-linguistic issues 
These are sad observations to be made about our present educational 
systems 

May I suggest that readers consult Apes, Men and Morons and Why 
Men Behave Like Apes by Earnest A Hooton, The Mentality of Apes 
by W Kohler, The Social Life of Apes and Monkeys by S Zuckerman, 
and many other studies of this kind. They might then more clearly un- 
derstand how the aristotelian type of education leads to the humanly 
harmful, gross, macroscopic, brutalizing, biological, animalistic types of 
orientations which are shown today to be humanly inadequate These 
breed such ‘fuhrers’ as different Hitlers, Mussolmis, Stalins, etc , whether 
m political, financial, industrial, scientific, medical,* educational, or even 
publishing, etc , fields, fancying that they represent ‘all’ of tlie human

world ! Such delusions must ultimately be destructive to human culture, 
and responsible for the tragic ‘cultural lag’, stressed so much today by 
social anthropologists 

Existing theories of ‘meaning’ of any school do not take into consider- 
ation that any definition of words by words must be based ultimately on 
undefined tei ms To the best of my knowledge this problem is not con- 
sidered at all in present day educational systems, outside of some sci- 
ences, and so the existing theories run in a vicious circle, just like a dog 
chasing his tail, and are bound to be ineffective, if not harmful. 

As Professor Keyser aptly formulates the problem ‘If he contend, as 
sometimes he will contend, that he has defined all his terms and proved 
all his propositions, then either he is a performer of logical miracles or 
he IS an ass , and, as you know, logical miracles are impossible ’* 

Similarly the theorists m the ‘theory of meaning’ as described above 
disregard the inadequacy for human orientation of the subject-predicate 
form of representation I must refer the reader to my chapter on rela- 
tions, page 188 ff , for further information. 

In principle, a typ'’ of orientation which restricts formally everything 
to subject-predicate xorms of representation can account only for sym- 
metrical relations, and we may beat in the bush about ‘meaning’ ; m prin- 
ciple, however, a theory of evaluation is then impossible Evaluation 
must be based on asymmetrical relations such as ‘more’ or ‘less’, etc., 
which cannot be dealt with at all adequately if restricted formally to sub- 
ject-predicate forms of representation, that harmfully affect our orien- 
tations 

What I have said here is correct m prmaple , however, in practice, in 
the neuro-semantic and neuro-lingmstic development of the white race we 
had to invent, by living necessity, some asj mmetncal relations such as 
‘more’ or ‘less’, etc The difficulty lies in the fact that these methods of 
escape from a subject-predicate grammatical structure of language were 
used only haphazardly, and not formulated generally into a workable 
system based on asymmetrical relations, which would be teachable. 

Similarly with the problem of intensional orientation by verbal defi- 
nitions and extensional orientation by facts (see p 173) , there is also 
confusion about it ‘Pure’ extension is humanly impossible, ‘pure’ inten- 
sion IS possible, and is often found in hospitals for ‘mentally’ ill, and m 
some chairs of ‘philosophy’ These issues and problems are seriously 
confusing to the average person because they have not been formulated 
befoi e 111 a methodological system.

3 INADEQUACY OF FORMS OF REPRESENTATION AND THEIR 
STRUCTURAL REVISION 

It IS not generall}' realized what serious difficulties an inadequate, 
unduly limited form of representation or theory brings about This is 
well known in science Thus, for instance, the euclidean and newtonian 
systems cannot deal successfully with electricity and so it was imperative 
to produce non-euclideaii and non-newtonian systems, which do apply to 
the sub-micioscopic electrical levels and also to the macioscopic gross 
levels Similarly in life, the two-valued aristolehan system could not 
deal adequately with the electro-colloidal sub-microscopic levels of the 
functioning of our nervous systems, on which sanity depends Thus the 
formulation of the present infinite-valued non-aristotelian system became 
also an imperative necessity 

I must stress that as the older systems are only special limitations of 
the new more general ‘non’ systems (see p 97), it would be incorrect to 
interpret a ‘non’ system as an ‘anti’ system 

Such a non-anstotelian sj'stem is long overdue It was retarded be- 
cause of persecution by the church and other influential bodies, the gen- 
eral belief that ‘Aristotle said the last word’, etc , and particularly because 
of the inherent difficulties of such a revision 

The problem of inadequacy in the forms of representation has handi- 
capped science and life a great deal until relatively adequate systems 
were produced In life the situation is much more aggravated, for if our 
orientations and evaluations are inadequate, our predictability is impaired, 
and we feel with the poet Housman, ‘I, a stranger and afraid, m a world 
1 1 never made’ If we have a more adequate or proper evaluation, we 
would have more correct predictability, etc , (see p 58 ff and p 750 ff ) 
We would then feel, ‘We are not strangers, and not afraid, in this human 
mess you and I have made’ 

Another of the main difficulties is that a language or a system of a 
given styucture can be somewhat altered from within, but cannot be 
revised structurally without going outside the former system For in- 
stance, all the attempts to revise the structure of the euclidean and new- 
tonian systems from within were ineffective Those who revised these 
systems structurally had to go outside the systems first, after which they 
were able to produce different, independent, new systems Only then did 
an effective evaluation of the former systems become possible 

Similarly the aristotelian, ti\o-valued, mtensional system can be re- 
vised structurally and evaluated properly only by building independently 
a non-aristotelian, infinite-valued, extensional system. This verifies the 
contention of Bertrand Russell made in 1922 that there is a ‘possibility’ 



xiv INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


that ‘every language has a structure concerning which, in the lan- 
guage, nothing can be said, but that there may be another language deal- 
ing with the structure of the first language, and having itself a new struc- 
ture’ * What Russell calls a ‘possibility’ becomes a fact once a system of 
different structure is built Then the issues become clear 

Russell limits himself to the structure of a language, and disregards 
the fact that this limitation is artificial, and that any language involves 
structural assumptions which build up a system of orientations that may 
be racial, national, personal, etc 

4 IDENTIFICATIONS AND MIS-EVALUATIONS 

The problem of general identification is a major problem which does 
not seem to be understood at all even by specialists Psychiatrists know 
professionally the tragic consequences of identifications m their patients 
But what even psychiatrists do not realize is that identifications in daily 
life are extremely frequent and bring about every kind of difficulties 

As a matter of fact we live in a world m which non-identity is as en- 
tirely general as gravitation, and so every identification is bound to be in 
some degree a mis-evaluation In a four-dimensional world where ‘every 
geometrical point has a date’, even an ‘electron’ at different dates is not 
identical with itself, because the sub-microscopic processes actually going 
on in this world cannot empirically be stopped but only transformed 
We can, however, through extensional and four-dimensional methods 
translate the dynamic into the static and the static into the dynamic, and 
so establish a similarity of structure between language and facts, which 
was impossible by aristotelian methods Unfortunately even some mod- 
ern physicists are unable to understand these simple facts 

To communicate to my classes what I want to convey to my readers 
here, the following procedure has been useful In my seminars I pick a 
young woman student and pre-arrange with hei a demonstration about 
which the class knows nothing During the lecture she is called to the 
platform and I hand her a box of matches which she takes carelessly and 
drops on the desk That is the only ‘crime’ she has committed Then 
I begin to call her names, etc , with a display of anger, waving my fists 
in front of her face, and finally witli a big gesture, I slap her face gently 
Seeing this ‘slap’, as a rule ninety per cent of the students recoil and 
shiver , ten per cent show no overt reactions The latter have seen what 
they have seen, but they delayed their evaluations Then I explain to the 
students that their recoil and shiver was an organismal evaluation very

harmful in principle, because they identified the seen facts with their 
judgements, creeds, dogmas, etc Thus their reactions were entirely 
unjustified, as what they have seen turned out to be merely a scientific 
demonstration of the mechanism of identification, which identification I 
expected 

Such identifications are very common The late Dr Joshua Rosett, 
formerly Professor of Neurology in Columbia University, and Scientific 
Director, Brain Research Foundation, New York, gives an example 
from his own experience 'A vivid picture on the cinema screen repre- 
sented a boy and a girl pulling down hay from a stack for bedding I 
sneezed — from the dust of the hay shown on the screen ’* 

The problem of identification m values is neurologically strictly con- 
nected with the pathological reversal of the natural order of evaluation, 
which IS found in different degrees in the maladjusted, neurotics, psy- 
chotics, and even in some ‘normal’ persons Thus, the supposedly inno- 
cent ‘shiver’ and the sneezing in the examples above, or the attack of hay 
fever when paper roses are shown (see p 128 ) , etc , may as well in other 
cases end in a sudden death or in a neurosis or psychosis The neuro- 
logical mechanisms are similar, involving identifications in values of 
different orders of abstractions, and therefore the very common reversal 
of the natural order of evaluation 

f In the evolution of the human race and language there was a natural 
order of evaluation established , namely, the life facts came first and labels 
(words) next in importance Today, from childhood up, we inculcate 
words and language first, and the facts they represent come next in value, 
another pathologically reversed order, by which we are unconsciously 
being trained to identify words with ‘facts’ Even in medicine we much 
too often evaluate by the definitions of ‘diseases’ instead of dealing with 
an individual sick patient, whose illness seldom fits textbook definitions 

The foregoing considerations deal directly with aristotehan orienta- 
tions by intension, or verbal definitions, where verbiage comes first in 
importance, and facts next By non-aristotehan methods we tram in the 
natural order , namely, that first order empirical facts are more important 
than definitions or verbiage. It should be noticed that the average child 
IS born extensional, and then his evaluations are distorted as the result 
of intensional training by parents, teachers, etc , who are unaware of the 
heavy neurological consequences 

These are key problems involved in the passing from aristotehan to 
non-aristotelian orientations, which affect our future personal, national

and international adjustments For a detailed discussion the reader is

‘natural order’, etc 

S METHODS OF THE MAGICIAN 

Another very serious difficulty arises due to the fact that our knowl- 
edge of the world and ourselves involves unavoidable factors of decep- 
tion and self-deception A scientific study of magic with its methods of 
psycho-logical deception is most revealing, as it shows the mechanisms 
by which we are continually and unknowingly being deceived m science 
and daily life * The stock in trade of the magician to fool the public con- 
sists of methods of misdirection, of mis-evaluation, half-truths, etc , used 
to play on the ordinary associations and implications, habits of hasty 
generalizations, etc , of the audience, thus leading to misinterpretations, 
identifications, lack of predictability, etc These general, and so common, 
psycho-logical mechanisms are very deep, and to a large extent are con- 
nected with the anstotelian type of intensional, subject-predicate orien- 
tations, which ultimately may become harmful 

For maximum adjustment, and therefore sanity, we need neurological 
methods to prevent and counteract these heretofore unavoidable old de- 
ceptions and self-deceptions In a non-aristotelian system these difficul- 
ties are recognized and empirical methods are discovered to eliminate 
them step by step Such methods of prevention and counteraction cul- 
minate in training in consciousness of abstracting (see Chapters XXVI, 
XXVII, XXIX and p 499 ff ) 

I must stress that as far as we humans are concerned, we cannot pos- 
sibly be entirely ignorant about ourselves , we may have only jalse knowl- 
edge or half-truths It is psychiatrically known that in many instances 
false knowledge, particularly about ourselves, breeds maladjustments, 
often of a serious character, just because it is based fundamentally on 
self-deception In the meantime we react and act ‘as tf" our half-truths or 
false knowledge were ‘all there is to be known’ Thus we are bound to 
be bewildered, confused, obsessed with fears, etc , because of mistakes 
due to our mis-evaluations, when we orient ourselves by verbal structures 
which do not fit facts 

Section C Revolutions and evolutions. 

One of the gravest difficulties faang the world today is the passing 
from one historical era to another Such passings, as history shows, have

always been painful, and pregnant with consequences To illustrate, the 
transition from papal control to non-papal control, passing through mur- 
derous religious persecutions and slaughters, including the devastating 
Thirty Years’ War, etc , from French royalism to republicanism, passing 
through the ferocious French Revolution and Commune, from czarism 
to state capitalism, passing through the latest bloody Russian Revolution 
and a period of so-called ‘communism’ Now we are witnessing the 
struggles of ‘democracies’ with ‘totalitarian states’, passing as yet through 
the recent ruthless Spanish War, second W orld War, etc , etc 

Similarly we can give illustrations of painful transitions from one 
system to another from the history of science, which uere also accom- 
panied by bewilderment and labour for instance, the passing from the 
ptolemaic to the copernican, from euclidean to non-euclidean, newtonian 
to non-newtonian (einsteinian), etc, systems 

In all these transitions it took one or more generations before the 
upheaval subsided and an adjustment was made to the new conditions 
No matter how painful and disturbing these transitions were, they 
were still changes and revisions within tlie then most general, intensional 
aristotehan system This system was imposed on the white race by the 
'church fathers'. Its strength and influence was due to its academically 
rationalized general verbal formulations which were set forth in text- 
books, and thus became teachable From the beginning the aristotehan 
system as formulated was inadequate and many attempts at corrections 
were made The white race was impressed by the church that ‘Aristotlq, 
spake’, and there was nothing more to be said In fact, attempts to revise 
this system were prohibited even up to very recent times Just the same, 
new facts which would not fit the aristotehan and church patterns were 
accumulating and so new methods, languages of special structure, etc., 
were required. 

Perhaps an illustration fiom the history of mathematics will help 
For more than 2,000 years by necessity mathematicians differentiated 
and integrated in some clumsy fashion in order to solve individual prob- 
lems But only after the formulation of a general theory by Newton and 
by Leibnitz did the general method become teachable and communicable 
as a general practical discipline (see p 574) which provided the founda- 
tions for future developments in mathematics 

The aristotehan system had been formulated in a very rationalized 
way Non-aristotelian attempts have been and are being made con- 
tinually in limited areas The difficulty was that no methodological gen- 
eral theory based on the new developments of life and science had been 
formulated until general semantics and a general, extensional, teachable 



xviii INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


and communicable, noii-anstotelian system was produced The mam 
difficulties ahead are neuro-semantic and neuro-lmguistic because lor 
more than 2,000 years our nervous systems have been canalized in the 
inadequate, intensional, often delusional, aristotelian orientations, which 
are reflected even m the structure of the language we habitually use. 

It may be helpful to indicate some historical facts of the development 
of our orientations since Socrates (469-399 B C ) Socrates was the 
son of a sculptor and himself did some work with the chisel and his hands 
He became an important founder of a school of ‘philosophy’ In brief, 
this school had very high standards for science, seeking the application of 
the science of the tune to life, so that it became what may be called a 
‘school of wisdom’ 

One of his students, Plato (427-347 B C ), who came from an aristo- 
cratic family, became the founder of a different school, called the ‘Acad- 
emy’, and the ‘father’ of what may be called ‘mathematical philosophy’ 
Unlike his teacher, he began, in his ‘Doctrine of Ideas’, to verbally split 
humans into ‘body’ and ‘mind’, as if they could be so split m living beings 
He built a system of ‘immatcrialism' or ‘idealism’ 

Aristotle (384-322 B C ), the son of a physician, was the student of 
Plato, and particularly interested in biology, other natural sciences, etc 
He founded the most influential of the three schools, which is called by 
his name He was undoubtedly one of the most gifted men mankind has 
ever known As usual in such cases, the study of one branch of knowl- 
edge leads to another, so Aristotle was led to the study of ‘logic’, lin- 
guistic structure, etc , about which he produced scholarly treatises or 
textbooks, ultimately formulating the most complete system of his time 
Because of the completeness of tlie system, backed by powerful influences, 
it has moulded our orientations and evaluations up to the present The 
man on the street, our education, medicine and even sciences, are still in 
the clutches of the system of Aristotle, a system inadequate for 1941 yet 
perhaps satisfactory 2,300 years ago, when conditions of life were rela- 
tively so simple, when orientations weie on the macroscopic level only, 
and knowledge of scientific facts was practically ml (see p 371 ff ). 

In Aristotle’s system as applied, the split becomes complete and insti- 
t tutionalized, with jails for the ‘animal’ and churches for the ‘soul’ Now 
we begin to realize how pernicious and retarding for civilization that split 
IS For instance, only since Einstein and Minkowski do we begin to 
understand that ‘space’ and ‘time’ cannot be split empirically, otherwise 
we create for ourselves delusional worlds. Only since their work has 
modern sub-microscopic physics with all its accomplishments become 
possible

Similarly, and tragically, this applies to medicine Until recently we 
have had a split medicine One branch, general mcdieine, was interested 
in the ‘body’ (soma) , the other was interested in the ‘soul’ (‘psyehe’) 
The net result was that general medicine was a glorified form of veterin- 
ary science, while psychiatry remained metaphysical However, it has 
been found empirically that a great many ‘physical’ ailments are of a 
semantogenic origin Only a few years ago general physicians began to 
understand that they cannot deal with humans without knowing some- 
thing about psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine began to be formu- 
lated I cannot go into further detail here, except to mention that this 
is another constructive step away from the aristotelian system, which as 
applied trams us in artificial, verbal splits 

If we train m methods which in piinciple lead to splitting the person- 
ality, we obviously train or prepare the ground for dementia praecox or 
schizophrenia, which very often involves a split personality At any 
rate, it does not seem to be advisable for sanity, and so proper evaluation 
of ‘facts’ and ‘reality’, to train our children in delusional methods Per- 
sonally, the author is always profoundly shocked that parents, who after 
all care for their children, can tolerate educators, physicians, scientists, 
etc , who train their children in such pernicious and hopelessly antiquated 
methods I also always wonder whether educators, physicians, scientists 
and other professionals realize what harm they can do by disregarding 
factors of sanity, or by ignoring them 

It is pitiful to watch how even some of the most outstanding scientists 
in the world are unable to understand what a passing from one system to 
another means. Thus, for example, an Encyclopedia of Unified Science 
was projected. A number of very scholarly treatises were published in 
it, and yet because the difficulties were not faced squarelj the authors are 
missing the point that neuro-semantic and neuro-linguistic mechanisms 
are involved and that we are passing from one system to another 

One of the tremendous obstacles m the revision of the aristotelian 
system is exactly the excellence of the woik of Aristotle based on the very 
few scientific facts known 2,300 years ago The aim of his work circa 
350 B c was to formulate the essential nature of science (350 b c ) and 
the forms and laws of science His immediate goal was entirely methodo- 
logical (350 B c ), and he aimed to formulate a general method for ‘all’ 
scientific work He was even expounding the theory of symmetrical 
relations, the relation of the general to the particular, etc In his days 
these orientations were by necessity two-valued and ‘objective’, hence

follows his whole S3’stem, then more or less satisfactory on macroscopic 
levels. A modern revision of the aristotehan system or the building of a 
non-aristotelian system involves, or is based on, similar aims, namely, 
the formulation of a general method not only for scientific work, but also 
life, as we know it today (1941) 

Modern scientific developments show that what we label 'objects’ or 
‘objective’ are mere nervous constructs inside of our skulls which our 
nervous systems have abstracted electio-colloidally from the actual world 
of electronic processes on the sub-microscopic level And so w'e have to 
face a complete methodological departure from two-valued, ‘objective’ 
orientations to general, infinite-valued, piocess orientations, as necessi- 
tated by scientific discoveries for at least the past sixty years 

The aim of the w ork of Aristotle and the work of the non-aristotehans 
IS similar, except for the date of our human development and the advance 
of science The problem is whether we shall deal with science and scien- 
tific methods of 350 b c or of 1941 a c In general semantics, in build- 
ing up a non-aristotehan system, the aims of Aristotle are preserved yet 
scientific methods are brought up to date 

Section D A non-aristotehan revision 

In an attempt to convey the magnitude of the task we are now con- 
fronting, I can do no better than to summarize roughly in the following 
tabulation some of the moie outstanding points of difference between the 
aristotehan system as it shapes our lives today, and ts lived by, and a 
scientific, non-aristotelian system, as it will, perhaps, guide our lives

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxiii 


The old orientations are being perpetuated, as a rule unknowingly, 
through the aristotehan striicLuie of oui language, our institutions, etc 
The new orientations are simpler than the old because they are closer to 
empirical facts, and so are even more easily absorbed by children — pro- 
vided parents, teachers, etc , are themselves aware of the new methods 
and so can give the children guidance 

The difficulties we are now facing, with the many important new fac- 
tors introduced in a non-aristotehan system, listed roughly in the tabula- 
tion, cannot be evaluated effectively unless we understand the role that 
new factors play m our generalizations 


Section E New factors the havoc they play with our generalizations. 


( 5 , 12 ) 


In mathematics and science we use extensively the method of inter- 
polation In building curves we do not have all the points or data We 
have a number of them and then connect the points with a smooth curve 

The equation of that curve is given on the 
basis of the actual data at hand The nervous 
processes which are involved in interpolations 
and building up equations are also involved in 
producing ordinary generalizations in daily 
life, that IS, we interpolate from the data we 
have and then generalize in words instead of 
equations It is well known that sometimes 
when a new datum is discovered it transforms 
the curve entirely, with a corresponding 
change in the equation (generalization) 

Fig. 2 as an illustration will make this 
clearer If we measure the experimental 
points (1,0), (3,6), (5,12), we would find 
them to he on the line abc with the equation 
y = 3x-3, and we might conclude therefrom 
that further similar experiments would con- 
firm the linearity of the relationship being 
studied. But if a further analysis yields the 
point (2,6), the simplest curve fitting these data is now the curve adbec, 
expressed by the equation y = .v^-9x’^ + 26.v-18, which is different and 
much more complex than before, because it is a cubic equation instead of 
a linear equation * 



*I am indebted for this example to Dr A S Householder, University of 
Chicago 



XXIV INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


It IS not generally recognized what havoc the discovery of a single 
new, important, structural factor may play with our generalizations. In 
science and ordinary life we are coming across such new factors quite 
often, and we have to change our equations or generalizations, and so 
our standards of evaluation, if we do not want to build up delusional 
situations for ourselves 

As an example I can suggest here tlie work of Professor W Bur- 
ridge,* who in his physiological investigations introduced the new 
unavoidable factor of the electro-colloidal structure of life In this case 
it does not matter whether the particular colloidal theory suggested by 
Burridge is correct or not The fact that he introduced an important 
new structural factor leads to entirely different interpretations, general- 
izations, etc, although the first order empirical facts remain Such an 
introduction requires a complete revision of the generalizations of biol- 
ogy, physiology, neurology, etc , and therefore even medicine and 
psychiatry Incidentally, psychosomatic results become at least intel- 
ligible 

Other examples may be given, such as the work of Professor William 
F Petersen,** i\ ho introduced the new factor of w eather into medicine , 
or of Freud, who introduced the ‘unconscious’, etc , or of Lorentz, Ein- 
stein and others, who introduced the finite velocity of light into the new- 
tonian system, etc., etc As is well known, the introduction of these new 
factors revolutionized constructively the older theories 

The scientific requirements of a new theory are very exacting A 
new theory must account for the known facts and predict new facts fol- 
low’ing the new generalizations, which in turn depend upon the new fac- 
tors or structural assumptions introduced The predicted new facts 
must then be verified empirically 

In general semantics we introduce a number of new unavoidable struc- 
tural factors, among others, our neuro-semantic (neuro-evaluational) 
and nenro-lmguistic environments as environment Such introductions 
also require a radical revision of what we know, and have wide applica- 
tions in daily life, as well as m sciences, including the foundation of 
mathematics (see chapters XIV, XV, XVIII, and XIX) and physics 
(see chapter XVII) These new factors should particularly interest 
parents, educators, medical men, psychiatrists, and other specialists 

The introduction of new factors may at first produce seeming diffi-

culties because of the unfamilianty of a new terminology which embodies 
the new structural assumptions, and because of the necessity of a re- 
canalization of our neuro-linguistic habits, etc Yet after the new orien- 
tations are acquired, the new issues become much simpler than the older, 
because they are better understood (see p 97). 

In at least one historical case, it was the omission of an unnecessary 
artificial assumption that brought about a transformation of the whole 
system. I speak here about euclidean geometry, which assumes the^ 
equal distance of parallels, and the non-euchdean geometries, which 
eliminated this equal distance postulate as unnecessary The results were 
very striking Thus, in the euclidean system we build curves out of little 
bits of ‘straight lines’ We do the opposite in the newer geometries — we 
start with curves, shortest distances, etc , not ‘straight lines’ (as no one 
knows what that means), and build up ‘straight lines’ as the limit of an 
arc of a circle with an ‘infinite radius’ (see p 590). 

Further explanations are given in the text, but I hope that I have con- 
veyed to the reader the fundamental character of these problems and 
some of the difficulties encountered at first when new structural factors 
are introduced Even the elimination of a postulate may be translated 
into an introduction of a new negative factor This translation is impor- 
tant in life, although it may be unimportant m technical mathematics 
In science as well as m life ue deal all the time with this kind of problems, 
and when they are not understood structurally, we are only plunged into 
paradoxes and bewilderment, and potential maladjustment 

Section F Non-aristotelian methods 

1 NEUROLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF EXTENSIONALIZATION 

There is an especially broad generalization, already referred to, which 
empirically indicates a fundamental difference between the traditional, 
aristotelian, intensional orientations, and the new non-anstotelian exten- 
sional orientations, and in many ways summarizes the radical differences 
between the two systems This is the problem of intension (spelled with 
an s) and extension, Aristotle, and his followers even today, recognized 
the difference between intension and extension However, they con- 
sidered the problem m the abstract, never applying it to human living 
reactions as Irving reactions, which can be predominantly intensional or 
predominantly extensional The interested reader is advised to consult 
any textbook on ‘logic’ concerning ‘intension’ and ‘extension’, as well as 
the material given in this text (see index). 

The difference can be illustrated briefly by giving examples of ‘defini- 



xxvi INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


tions’. Thus a ‘definition’ by intension is given in terms of aristotelian 
‘properties’ For instance, we may verbally ‘define’ ‘man’ as a ‘feather- 
less biped’, ‘rational animal’, and what not, which really makes no differ- 
ence, because no listing of ‘properties’ could possibly cover ‘all’ the char- 
acteristics of Smithi, Smiths, etc , and their inter-relations. 

By extension ‘man’ is ‘defined’ by exhibiting a class of individuals 
made up of Smithi, Smiths, etc 

On the surface this difference may appear unimportant , not so in liv- 
ing life applications The deeper problems of neurological mechanisms 
enter here If we orient ourselves piedommantly by intension or verbal 
definitions, our orientations depend mostly on the cortical region If we 
orient ourselves by extension or facts, this type of orientation by neces- 
sity follows the natural order of evaluation, and involves thalamic factors, 
introducing automatically cortically delayed reactions. In other words, 
orientations by intension tend to tram our nervous systems in a split be- 
tween the functions of the cortical and thalamic regions ; orientations by 
extension involve the integration of cortico-thalamic functions. 

Orientations by extension induce an aiitomahc delay of reactions, 
which automatically stimulates the cortical region and regulates and pro- 
tects the reactions of the usually over-stimulated thalamic region. 

What was said here is elementary from the point of view of neurology 
The difficulty is that this little bit of neurological knowledge is not applied 
in practice Neurologists, psychiatrists, etc , have treated these prob- 
lems in an ‘abstract’, ‘academic’, detached way only, somehow, entirely 
unaware that living human reactions depend on the working of the human 
nervous system, from which dependence there is no escape. No wonder 
‘philosophers’, ‘logicians’, mathematicians, etc , disregard the working of 
their nervous systems if even neurologists and psychiatrists still orient 
themselves by verbal fictions m the ’abstract’ 

If we investigate, it seems appalling how little of the vast knowledge 
we have is actually applied Even the ancient Persians showed their 
understanding of the difference between learning and applying m their 
proverb ‘He who learns and learns and yet does not what he knows, is 
one who plows and plows yet never sows’. In this new modern non- 
aristotehan system we have not only to ’know' elementary facts of modern 
science, including neuro-hnguistic and neuro-semantic researches, but 
also to apply them. In fact, the whole passage from the aristotelian to 
non-aristotehan systems depends on this change of attitude from inten- 
sion to extension, from macroscopic to sub-microscopic orientations, 
from ‘objective’ to process orientations, from subject-predicate to rela- 
tional evaluations, etc This is a laborious process and months of self- 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxvii 


discipline are required for adults before these new methods can be applied 
generally ; children as a rule have no difficulties 

If we stop to reflect, however, it seems obvious that those who are 
trained m two-valued, macroscopic, ‘objective’, aristotehan orientations 
only, are thoroughly unable to have modern, electro-colloidal, sub-micro- 
scopic, infinite-valued, process oiientations m life, which can be acquired 
only by training m non-aristotehan methods 

It IS sad indeed to deal with even young scientists m the colloidal and 
quantum fields who, after taking off their aprons in the laboratory, re- 
lapse immediately into the two-valued, prevalent aristotehan orientations, 
thus ceasing to be scientific 1941 In many ways these scientists are 
worse off than the ‘man on the street’, because of the artificially accen- 
tuated split between their scientific and their life orientations Although 
they work in an infinite-valued, non-aristotelian field, even they need spe- 
cial training to become conscious of how to apply their own saentific non- 
aristotelian methods to life problems 

Empirically the consequences of training in the new methods are 
astonishingly far-reaching This is easily understood after reflection, 
because the integrating of the functions of the cortical and thalamic re- 
gions brings about better functioning of glands, organs,' etc Although 
general semantics is not a medical science, we can understand why the 
non-aristotelian extensional thalamo-cortical methods bring about a great 
deal of stabilization and even psychosomatic consequences, as the em- 
pirical results achieved by my psychiatric co-workers and myself indicate 

2 NEURO-SEMANTIC RELAXATION 

The optimum working of the nervous system depends, among other 
things, on ‘normal’ blood pressure, which is predominantly a thalamic 
function, supplying the nervous system with necessary blood circulation 
As both affective, or ‘emotional’, respionses and blood pressure are neuro- 
logically closely connected, it is fundamental for ‘emotional’ balance to 
have ‘normal’ blood pressure, and vice versa 

In general semantics we utilize what I call ‘neuro-semantic relaxa- 
tion’, which, as attested by physicians, usually brings about ‘normal’ 
blood pressure, that is, it lowers abnormally high pressure and raises 
abnormally low pressure, thus regulating the essential blood circulation, 
and so blood supply The standards for ‘normal’ are given in statistical 
averages and are not accurate for the given individual, and at different 
times These conditions and beneficial consequences are strictly em- 
pirical, and must be taken into account, regardless of the fact that the 
present scientific theones on this subject are not yet clear It must be 



xxviu INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


realized that for the ‘normal’ working of the nervous system we must 
have a proper blood nrrulation, which ma}' be affected by the tension of 
blood vessels, and is also connected wth ‘emotional’ tension We are 
never aware of this particular steady kind of ‘emotional’ tension, which 
involves hidden fears, anxieties, uncertainties, frustrations, etc., and 
through the neivous mechanisms of projection colour harmfully our atti- 
tudes toward the world and life in general Such conditions result in 
defensiveness, lohich is no defense, but a wasteful, useless dram on the 
limited nervous capacities 

Some details of the mechanisms and techniques involved, as they 
affect, among others, so-called 'speech difficulties’, (stuttenng, etc ) are 
given by Professor Wendell Johnson, University of Iowa, in his Lan- 
guage and Speech Hygiene An Application of General Semantics, pub- 
lished as the first monograph of the Institute of General Semantics 
More details concerning neuro-semantic relaxation will be presented in 
professional papers 


3 EXTENSIONAL DEVICES AND SOME APPLICATIONS 

To achieve extensionahzation we utilize what I call ‘extensional 
devices’ : 


1) Indexes 

2) Dates 

3) Etc (ef cetera) 

4) Quotes 

5) Hyphens 


Working Devices 


Safety Devices 


It should be noticed that in a four-dimensional world dating is only a 
particular temporal index by which we can deal effectively with space- 
time In non-afistotehan orientations these extensional devices should 
be used habitually and permanently, with a slight motion of the hands 
to indicate absolute individuals, events, situations, etc , which change at 
different dates, also different orders of abstraction, etc Thus thalamic 
factors become involved, without which the coveted thalamo-cortical inte- 
gration cannot be accomplished 

I may add that all existing psychotherapy, no matter of what school, 
is based on the partial and particular extensionahzation of a given patient, 
depending on the good luck and personal skill of the psychiatrist Un- 
fortunately these specialists are in the mam unaware of what is said here, 
and of the existence of a theory of sanity which gives general, simple, and 
workable thalamo-cortical methods for extensionahzation, and so thalamo- 
cortical integration. 

A few illustrations of the wide practical applications of some of the 
devices may be given here In many instances serious maladjustments 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxix 


follow when ‘hate’ absorbs the whole of the affective energy of the given 
individual In such extreme cases ‘hate’ exhausts the limited affective- 
energy No energy is left for positive feelings and the picture is often 
that of a dementia praecox, etc. Thus an individual ‘hates’ a generaliza- 
tion ‘mother’, ‘father’, etc , and so by identification ‘hates’ ‘all mothers’, 
‘all fathers’, etc , m fact, hates the whole fabric of human society, and 
becomes a neurotic or even a psychotic Obviously, it is useless to preach 
‘love’ for those who have hurt and have done the harm Just the oppo-^ 
site; as a preliminary step, by indexing we allocate or limit the ‘hate’ to 
the individual Srnithi, instead of a ‘hate’ for a generalization which 
spreads over the world In actual cases we can watch how this alloca- 
tion or limitation of ‘hate’ from a generalization to an individual helps 
the given person The more they ‘hate’ the individual Sniithi instead of 
a generalization, the more positive affective energy is liberated, and the 
more ‘human’ and ‘normal’ they become It is a long struggle, but so far 
empirically invariably successful, provided the student is willing to work 
persistently at himself. 

But even this indexed individualized ‘hate’ is not desirable, and we 
eliminate it rather simply by dating Obviously Smithi^‘’^° is not 
Smithi“‘® and most of the time hurti^®“ would not be a ‘hurt’ in 1940 
With such types of orientations the individual becomes adjusted, and 
serious improvements m family and social relationships follow, because 
the student has trained himself in a general method for handling his own 
problems. 

Similar mechanisms of generalization through identifications are in- 
volved in morbid and other generalized jears which are so disastrous for 
daily adjustment Because thalamic jactors are involved, these difficul- 
ties are helped greatly or eliminated by a similar use of the extensional 
devices to individualize and then date the allocated fears 

What a heavy price we may sometimes pay for the disregard of exten- 
sional devices in connection with the structure of language, can be illus- 
trated no better than by the life history and work of Dr Sigmund Freud 
In his writings Freud ascribed one intensional undifferentiated ‘sex' even 
to infants, which revolted public opinion If Freud would have used the 
extensional devices he would not have gotten into such detrimental pro- 
fessional and other difficulties He would not have used the fiction ‘sex’ 
without indexes, dates and quotes, and he would have explained that an 
infant has a ticklish organ which could be labelled ‘sexo®’ at birth, ‘sexi^’ 
at the age of one, ‘sexa^’ at the age of two, etc These are obviously dif- 
ferent in life, but the differences are hidden by the one abstract defini- 
tional term ‘sex’, and made obvious only by the extensional techniques 



XXX INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


Let us be frank about it The mtensional abstract ‘sex’ labels a fiction 
By extension or facts, ‘sex’ vanes with every individual not only with 
age (dates), but in relation to endless other factors, and can be handled 
adequately only by the use of extensional devices. 

4 IMPLICATIONS OF THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE 

In what IS said above we were already dealing with the change from 
an mtensional to an extensional structure of language, and so orienta- 
tion We can investigate a step further, and find that the aristotelian 
structure of language is m the mam elementahstic, implying, through 
structure, a split or separation of what m actuality cannot be separated 
For instance, we can verbally split ‘body’ and ‘mind’, ‘emotion’ and ‘intel- 
lect’, ‘space’ and ‘time’, etc , which as a matter of fact cannot be separated 
empirically, and can be split only verbally These elementahstic, split- 
ting, structural characteristics of language have been firmly rooted m us 
through the aristotelian training It built for us a fictitious animistic 
woild not much more advanced than that of the primitives, a world in 
which under present conditions an optimum adjustment is m principle 
impossible 

In a non-aristotelian system we do not use elementahstic terminology 
to represent facts wdiich are non-elementalistic We use terms like 
‘semantic reactions’, ‘psychosomatic’, ‘space-time’, etc , which eliminate 
the verbally implied splits, and consequent niis-evaluations. In the be- 
ginning of my seniiiiais when I am explaining space-time, students often 
react by saying, ‘Oh, you mean “space” and “tune” ’. This translation 
would abolish the whole modern advances of physics, because of the 
structural implications of a delusional verbal split. Similarly the 
habitual use of the non-elementahstic term ‘semantic reactions’ eliminates 
metaphysical and verbal speculations on such elementahstic fictions as 
‘emotion’ and ‘intellect’, etc , considered as separate entities 

Unfortunately these considerations of structural implications have 
been entirely disregarded in daily life even by scientists, often befuddling 
issues very seriously Thus, the term ‘concept’ is widely used, and the 
users are not conscious that this term has elementahstic implications of 
‘mind’ or ‘intellect’ taken separately, which then become verbal fictions. 
The actual facts, however, can be simply expressed with correct struc- 
tural implications What is called ‘concept’ amounts to nothing more 
or less than a verbal jormulation, a term which eliminates the false-to-fact 
implications Students of general semantics are strongly advised never 
to use the elementahstic term ‘concept’, but the non-elementahstic ‘formu- 
lation’ instead We could eventually berate and ridicule people for their 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxxi 


old neuro-hnguistic habits, but in our work we take the neurological atti- 
tude and realize the difficulties of linguistic habits and neurological re- 
canahzation. From this point of view we only face understandingly the 
inherent difficulties I can even now hear the reactions of some of my 
readers, T fully agree with you, and I believe it is a very fine concept' > 
And so it goes 

From the above it becomes obvious that without changing the lan- 
guage Itself, which IS practically impossible, we can easily change the 
structure of language to one free from false-to-fact implications This 
change is feasible 

Another example may make issues clearer Thus the intensional 
verbal definition of ‘man’ or ‘chair’, etc, brings to our consciousness 
similarities, and, so to say, drives the differences into the ‘unconscious’ 
In a world of processes and non-identity it follows that no individual, 
‘object’, event, etc , can be the ‘same’ from one moment to the next And 
so individualizing (indexes) and temporal devices (dates), etc, should 
be used conjointly Thus, obviously chairi^“°“ is not the ‘same’ as 
chairi^®^®, nor is Smithi“°”‘'"’ the ‘same’ as Smithi’^""^'’'’ Orientations in 
such extensional terms bring to our consciousness not only similarities 
but also differences Through training in the consciousness of abstract- 
ing we become aware that characteristics are left out in the process of 
abstracting by our nervous systems, and so we become conscious of the 
possibility that new factors may arise at any time which would necessitate 
a change m our generalizations 

Once more we can get a bit of wisdom from mathematical method 
I believe it was the great mathematician Sylvester who said that ‘in 
mathematics we look for similarities m differences and differences in 
similarities’, which statement should apply to our whole life orientation 
This IS made uniquely applicable to life by the new non-aristotelian exten- 
sional structure of language and so orientations. 

The reader will find in this work the use of ceitain terms which, 
although they are standard English words, are not habitually used The 
terms used here have been carefully selected and tested, and found to be 
more similar to the structure of the actual facts The power of terminol- 
ogy, because of its structural implications, is well known m science, but 
IS entirely disregarded in our daily neuro-hnguistic habits 

It IS shocking to realize that even such scholarly aristotehans as the 
Jesuits, and other devotees, are unable or unwilling to comprehend the 
obvious structural modern neuro-semantic and neuro-hnguistic facts 
When confronted with them they hide behind a ^rba[ ■imn ke screen - of 
medieval terms such as ‘nominalism’, ‘realism’, etc , which in modern sci- 



xxxii INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


ence are hopelessly antiquated, useless, confusing, and so eventually 
harmful Their attitude even today is that all those problems were 
settled and disposed of by different monks in the Middle Ages Modern 
researches reveal that nothing of the sort was settled or disposed of, and 
that a new, up-to-date revision is necessary to eliminate the false knowl- 
edge from which present day tragedies follow automatically. The reader 
IS referred to the Enc3'clopaedia Britannica under such terms as ‘nominal- 
ism’, ‘realism’, and related terms 

Section G y^defined terms * 

As was explained before, for a revision of a system we must first get 
outside of the system Only after producing a non-aristotehan exten- 
sional system can the aristotehan intensional structure of our traditional 
system and language be properly evaluated. 

Here we introduce a most important technical term which describes 
a fundamental characteristic of a correct attitude toward language, 
namely, that most terms are ‘;£^efined’ They are over-defined (over- 
limited) by intension, or verbal definition, because of our beliej in the 
definition, and are hopelessly under-defined by extension or facts, 
when generalizations become merely hypothetical For instance, the 
euclidean parallels with their equal distance are over-defined by intension 
and under-defined by extension, as ‘equal distance’ is unnecessary and 
also IS denied by facts Similarly the newtonian equations are over- 
defined (over-limited) by intension, while under-defined by extension, 
which includes the necessary finite velocity of a signal (Lorentz- 
Einstem) 

From these two examples alone we may see how heavy the problem 
IS, as the discovery of a new important factor makes it obvious that most 
generalizations must be ;^^defined, depending upon whether our atti- 
tude IS intensional or extensional Unfortunately only those who have 
studied psychiatry and/or general semantics can fully comprehend the 
difficulties involved Different maladjusted, neurotics, psychotics, etc., 
orient themselves by intension most of the time. This means they evalu- 
ate by over-definition, just because they beheve m their limited verbal- 

* The term ‘over -defined class’ was introduced to the best of ray knowledge by 
Dr A S Householder This term is madequate for our purpose, as it disregards 
the problems of intension and extension, which represent different types of evaluation 
Besides, the term ‘class’ is very ambiguous In science and life we deal mostly 
with ^^^defined terms, as will be explained 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxxni 


isms, and not by extensional facts, which make us conscious of under- 
definitioii 

To make this fundamental difficulty clearer I will use a rather trivial 
illustration. The dictionaries define ‘house’ as a ‘building’ for human 
habitation or occupation’, etc Let us imagine that we buy a house , this 
buying is an extensional activity, usually with some consequences If 
we orient ourselves by intension we are really buying a definition, 
although we may even inspect the house, which may appear desirable, 
etc Then suppose we move into the house with our furniture and the 
whole house collapses because termites have destro}fed all the wood, leav- 
ing only a shell, perhaps satisfying to the eye Does the verbal defini- 
tion of the house correspond to the extensional facts? Of course not 
It becomes obvious then that by intension the term ‘house’ was over- 
defined, or over-limited, while by extension, or actual facts, it was hope- 
lessly under-defined, as many important characteristics were left out 
In no dictionary definition of a ‘house’ is the possibility of termites men- 
tioned 

‘Philosophers’, etc , and ‘philosophizing’ laymen, if they ever will be 
able to face facts and verbal paradoxes, will have a merry time arguing 
back and forth about the above human and neuro-linguistic situation 
because they know nothing about psychiatry and eniptncal data of gen- 
eral semantics Without serious neuro-linguistic study, including the 
‘philosophical treatises’ of ‘mentally’ ill m hospitals, they will not be able 
to understand why, by intension or beliej in verbal definitions, most terms 
are hopelessly over-defined, while by extension they are hopelessly under- 
defined Their analysis of intensional ‘over-definitions’ will be exten- 
stonal by necessity, and they will have gieat difficulties in realizing the 
very important fact that we deal for the most part only with ^^defined 
terms 

I must stress again that this difficulty is not inherent in our language 
as such, but depends exclusively on our attitude toward the tise of lan- 
guage 

The Ignorance of ‘philosophers’, etc , about neifro-semantic and neiiro- 
linguistic issues is not only appalling, but positively harmful to sanity, 
civilization and culture To justify their own existence in civilization 
they should have investigated such problems professionally long ago, and 
incorporated them in their work Even the present world tragedies are 
one of the results of their intensional delusional ne/o'o-semantic and 
wenro-linguistic detachment Present day totalitarianisms were built 
by the dumping on the human nervous systems of such terms as ‘com- 
munism,’ ‘bolshevism,’ etc , which induced corresponding fearful signal

reactions (see chapter XXI) of the ruling classes, resulting in their im- 
becilic and suicidal behaviour The ruling classes welcomed in many 
ways the totahtarians as an eventual safe-guard of their personal selfish 
interests The extensional results are that the dreaded ‘communists’ and 
‘bolshevists’ have united with the totalitarians, and today, 1940, the ‘com- 
munists’ are as ‘imperialistic’ as any czar has ever been 

To give another example of ;^^defined terms, it may be helpful to 
cite a paradox formulated by the mathematician Frege in connection with 
linguistic difficulties underlying mathematical foundations. 

In a village there was only one barber, who shaved only those who 
did not shave themselves The question arises whether the barber shaves 
himself or not. If we say ‘yes,’ then he did not shave himself ; if we say 
‘no,’ then he shaved himself In daily life we deal all the time with such 
paradoxes, which if not clarified result only m bewilderment. 

The term ‘barber’ as a term, since it omits the living human being, is 
a label for a fiction, because there is no such thing as a ‘barber’ without 
a living human being By extension the given specialist in shaving, 
Smithi, IS not so simple He is peppered with complex chain-indexes 
and dates Thus, Smithi^ may be by profession a barber, Smithaa may be 
a father, Smithij may be a member of the village council, and anyway 
Smithi„ IS a living person who has his own life and personality outside his 
profession, and ultimately he has to shave himself if he does not want a 
beard, verbalism or no verbalism Obviously the term ‘barber’ is over- 
defined, over-limited, by intension, and is under-defined by extension. 

One of my co-workers, commenting on this paradox, suggested that 
the barber may be a woman and have no beard , or, the barber may be a 
beardless hermaphrodite or eunuch , or, the barber may have a full beard. 
Thus, we have only traditionally assumed, in analyzing this old paradox, 
that the barber was a man with a beard which was somehow shaved. 

The difficulties of this ^^defined terms situation affect not only 
our daily lives, but science as well. For example, H^O is by intension or 
definition over-defined , by extension or in practice we do not deal with 
‘pure’ H 2 O, which is only a symbol on paper, because actually unavoid- 
able impurities are always present. 

Similarly let us consider ‘blood transfusion' In the beginning we 
used the term ‘blood transfusion’ as over-defined , by extension it turned 
out to be under-defined, because different bloods have different charac- 
teristics, and often blood of one type killed the patient who had blood of 
another type 

Here I will list a few of the many heavy terms we use in science and 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xxxv 


daily life which are the cause of endless verbal bickering and confusion, 
because of our lack of realization of their j^defined character, depend- 
ing uniquely on our attitudes Terms such as variation in biology and 
anthropology, learning, frustration, education, needs, intelligence, in- 
stincts, genius, teacher, leadersHip, love, hate, fear, sex, man, zvonian, 
infantilism, maladjustment, dementia praecox, personality, democracy, 
totalitarianism, dollar, god, gold, war, peace, aggression, neutral, jew, 
number, velocity, etc , etc , can serve as illustrations 

One psychoanalyst suggests ego and super-ego, another writes T 
could quote you a considerable part of psychoanalytic terms’. An epis- 
tomologist says, ‘Meaning is a forbidden term in my courses ... In 
linguistics the terms phoneme, word, sentence are mazes of confusion. 
. . . Philosophy is in as bad a situat’on Metaphysics is even worse ’ 
To quote a prominent anthropologist: ‘^^definition is notably com- 
mon m the field of so-called social anthropology in which students at- 
tempt to disregard the human organism and deal with human affairs as 
discrete phenomena’. For example, ‘culture may be technology, morals, 
philosophy, or a wooden leg — all most vaguely formulated . . When 
some change in the anatomy and physiology of the organism is attributed 
to environment, the latter term is not broken down into climate, rainfall, 
food supply, etc Social environment may be arts, industries, law, 
morals, religion, familial institutions, tradition, etc ’ 

The following comment by a mathematician shows the generality of 
this problem- ‘A term would seem to be extensionally under-defined so 
long as we cannot m practice exhaust its instances by enumeration But 
this much is true of just about every teim of the kind traditionally known 
as “general concrete” , e g house, dime, star, neurone ' 

A journalist suggests ‘As an example recently come to our attention 
I would mention those magic words Monroe Doctrine Even when Mr. 
Hull discusses it, as he does as nearly correctly as anyone “m the know”, 
he omits some real facts, such as the economic implications of overturn- 
ing the international status quo in this hemisphere But when Japan 
and/or Germany (high order abstractions as used here) refer to Asiatic 
and/or European Monroe Doctrines, the meaning of the original words 
has been completely metamorphosed through ^^definition The Amer- 
ican accepted meaning includes no actual control of those falling within 
the doctrine’s sphere, whereas Japan and Germany mean an actual 
hegemony in their respective spheres The relationship between ours 
and theirs is therefore a vast confusion of terms 

‘Then consider the incidents growing out of insults in the interna- 



xxxvi INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


tional fields. What is an insult ? It is usually pure verbalism with great 
affective characteristics manipulated to sway others as the swaycr directs 
To bring it into the domestic field, call a Republican (what is that?) 
a New Dealer (again, what is that?) and the fur begins to fly ’ 

A leading moving picture executive says that actors have frequent 
verbal arguments about what is jtinny The only thing to do is to try 
It before an audience ‘If it makes them laugh, it may be termed 
_ funny If it fails to make them laugh, it is not funny ’ In the mean- 
time, ‘your audience may tell you that the subject in dispute is neither 
funny nor not-funny. It is merely boring ’ 

There is no need to give further examples here, as practically the 
whole dictionary could be quoted In my enquiry concerning j^^dehned 
terms in many fields I got a number of answers which were very fun- 
damental, which I gratefully acknowledge Some replies were to the 
effect that ‘I would gladly give you examples such as you ask for, but I 
do not think I have any that would be new to you’, which shows their 
understanding of the problem Yet the most extensional answer was 
given by that brilliant jurist. Dr Robert M Hutchins, who sent to me 
his Convocation Address of June, 1940 with a letter, which he has kindly 
given me permission to quote, as follows • ‘I am afraid you will feel that 
all the words I use are examples of the errors you are attacking Here 
IS my last Convocation Address, with a sample in every line ’ Such a 
judgement is profoundly justified whenever language is utilized This 
address is a splendid piece of work, and it implies the intuitive recogni- 
tion of the fundamental neuro-linguistic difficulties we are up against 
But an intuitive grasp by exceptional persons does not make that 
recognition teachable in general education. We need crisp, general 
methodological formulations which will make people aware of the role 
the structure of language plays in affecting our types of reactions For 
instance, our language may be elementalistic or non-elementalistic, inten- 
sional or extensional, m structure, etc We discover also the fundamen- 
tal multiordinal character of the most important terms we have, the 
l^defined character of most of our terms, etc 

As the difficulties mentioned here are inherent in our neuro-semantic 
and neuro-lmguistic mechanisms, which control our reactions, the only 
possible safe-guard against the dangers of hopeless bewilderment, fears, 
anxieties, etc , is the consciousness of the mechanisms Certainly ‘phi- 
losophers’, ‘logicians’, psychiatrists, educators, etc, should be aware of 
these problems, and introduce this consciousness even in elementary 
education and in psychotherapy

Section H The passing oj the old aristotelian epoch 
1 'MAGINOT LINE MENTALITIES’ 

Present day scientific researches and historical world developments 
show there is no doubt that the old aristotelian epoch of human evolution 
is dying The terrors and horrors we are witnessing m the East and 
the West are the deathbed agonies of that passing epoch, and not the 
beginning of a new system The changes of historical periods in human 
development are often accompanied by the disorganization, and some- 
times acute suffering, of mankind, and the price is bound to be paid by 
one or more generations 

I doubt if in the whole of human history there is a more accentuated 
illustration than the tragic and sudden collapse, in the summer of 1940, 
of the French government and army, and eventually of French culture 
and ‘democracy’ The degree of stupidity, treachery, graft, dishonesty. 
Ignorance, and ultimately decadence, etc , the French plutocrats and poli- 
ticians, and so-called ‘intelligentsia’ displayed is unprecedented, particu- 
larly because of the fine historical record the French have had. We test 
the freshness or deterioration of fishes by smelling the head end, and as 
we know at the date of this writing, the head ends of the French ‘democ- 
racy’ have a putrid odor This deterioration affected the French military 
men, who once were the finest in the world, and so the collapse was com- 
plete I can give no better, no moie pitiful, no more shocking illustra- 
tion of the collapse of the old system 

The ‘Maginot line mentality’ will become a historical classic, and will 
be applied quite appropi lately to other than military fields It means a 
thoughtless, self-deceptive, etc , ‘security’ in antiquated systems as 
matched against modern methods of 1940 Well, the French Marianna 
felt secure from the front and was taken from behind by the German army 
men, who traditionally pay no attention to such ‘details’.

Dealing with those tragic and painful collapses in civilizations, and 
eventually passing to another spasm of civilization, what interests us 
most in considering the problems of sanity, is the newest, psychopatho- 
logical methods of destroying sanity, not merely the organized orgies of 
murder, rape, arson, looting, drugging, and destruction under different 
dictators, mikados, etc 

I mention the ‘mikado’ especially here as a tragic human example of 
the effect of ;^^defined terms, which in lije application sway the his- 
tory of mankind By definition and/or creed the mikado is supposed to 
be some sort of a ‘god’, etc By extension or facts, the best we know, he 
IS probably a sort of a nice, supposedly educated, collegian He has a 
wife and makes babies, but he is told about Japanese people, the be- 
haviour of Japanese troops in China, etc , only as much as the ruling 
clique in Japan allows him to know If he would be allowed to know 
what ‘his’ soldiers, and so his representatives, are actually doing in China 
with their governmentally organised murder, rape, looting, drugging, 
etc , I doubt if he, as a ‘nice collegian’, would approve it However, if 
he would try to do sometlimg about it, he probably would be ‘liquidated’ 
by the ruling clique From a historical, civilization, human point of view 
he must be adjudged responsible, as the head of his government, for what 
the ruling clique and the Japanese army do in China in his name 

This applies to many other ‘rulers’, who seldom know what is going 
on extensionally because they rely on the use of ;^^^efined terms in 
the reports of those who are m actual control Ignorance in high places 
cannot humanly be an excuse 

Imagine a British empire tolerating so long a Chamberlain in the 
government, or the endless petty, befuddling, deluding, etc , bickerings of 
political partisanship, which are good enough to wreck any system of 
‘democracy’ (in practice another ^^deiined term). 

It seems, however, there is at least one point the totalitarian and 
‘democratic’ politicians have in common, best expressed by Kipling

2 WARS OF AND ON NERVES 

It was explained already how the mtioduction of new factors is bound 
to change our generalizations and therefore evaluations. But this some- 
how is disregarded by most rulers and politicians who are on the defen- 
sive, while those who are on the offensive introduce new psycho-logisal 
factors to confuse the old generalizations, as a rule successfully. Poli- 
ticians, gangsters, military men, etc , without any understanding of the 
depth of destructiveness to the human nervous systems, utilize these 
methods quite successfully Magicians have studied those methods pro- 
fessionally, but they utilize them for entertainment, not for destruction 

These destructive methods are the bases of the ‘war 0 / nerves’, and 
the ‘war on nerves', etc , to the point of using ‘screaming’ bombs, verbal 
distortion, the 'psychology' of deception, etc These methods can be 
counteracted only when governments who feel their responsibility not 
only to the ruling classes, but also to the people of their nations, will 
employ experts in neuro-psychiatry, anthropology, general semantics, etc , 
for guidance, if the present world neurosis is to be checked 

There are persistent reports that the Nazi government is utilizing a 
staff of psycho-logical experts for destructive purposes Other totali- 
tarian governments ape their successfully worked out and tested methods 
The ‘democratic’ governments m this present fundamental nerve contest 
appear a tragic joke of ignorance, inefficiency, etc In practice this 
amounts to betrayal, because they fail to recognize the overwhdmmg im- 
portance and vulnerability of the human nervous system, and do not utilize 
such experts m a constructive way The ‘scream’ of a bomb, for instance, 
is much more destructive to the ‘enemy’ than the destruction by the bomb 
itself, which may kill a few people at the cost of at least $100,000 per 
corpse, while the ‘scream’ alone brings demoralizing tei roi to hundreds, 
if not thousands of people It is certainly an expeitly calculated and 
efficient ‘war on human nerves’ But what can be done if ignoiant ‘demo- 
cratic’ governments refuse to live up to their duties ^ 

Humanity, civilizations, cultures, etc , ai e ultimately based on the 
constructive use of neuro-semantic and neuro-lmguistic mechanisms

fully because of the abysmal ignorance of modern scientific issues exhib- 
ited by the political verbalists and enchanters of other nations. 

One of the most effective of these methods is the use of pathological 
verbal distortion such as is found among the ‘mentally’ ill For instance, 
a paranoiac may believe ‘honestly’ that he is persecuted, become domi- 
nated by ‘hate’, etc , and ultimately may kill to ‘defend’ himself. Unfor- 
tunately at present only psychiatrists, familiar with verbal distortions and 
‘rationalizations’ of patients in hospitals, can fully understand these 
problems. 

A ‘mentally’ ill person is not necessarily a ‘genius,’ but it is well 
known to psychiatrists that some ‘mentally’ ill are often very cunning and 
will outwit any doctor or nurse At present the people of the wor Id do 
not realize that they are being trained m psychopathological uses of fcheir 
nervous systems, and a future generation or two will become semant jcally 
crippled because trained in such distortions 

The violation, through ignorance and/or iin-sanity, of the similarity 
of structure in the map-territory relationship (see p 58 ff and p. 750 
ff ), and/or deliberate, professionally planned distortion of it, abolishes 
predictability, proper evaluation, trust, etc This results only in breeding 
fears, anxieties, hates, etc, which disorganize individuals and even 
nations There must be a coriespondence and similarity of structure 
between language and facts, and so consequent thalamo-cortical integra- 
tion, if we are to survive as a sane ‘civilized’ race 

In a few years history will judge these dying spasms of the aristotehan 
system, a system which was the best of its kind 2,300 years ago, as for- 
mulated by a great man under the conditions of the very few scientific 
facts known at that date It is not so today, 1941 Most of the knowl- 
edge of scientific facts and methods of Aristotle are obsolete today, and m 
the mam harmful, like the ‘Magmot line’ orientation 

By necessity the aristotehan system was based on macroscopic or 
animal, ‘sense’, levels, which even now predominantly guide the masses 
It could take into consideration ‘sense’ data, etc , but cannot deal ade- 
quately with 1941 cultural as well as sanity conditions which, as we know 
today, are resultants of sub-microscopic, electro-colloidal processes 
In a non-aristotehan system we are stressing the differences between

Professor Pavlov, Dr Chakotni bases his analysis of totalitarian methods 
on Pavlov’s fundainentdl lesearches of conditional reactions in dogs 

3 HITLER AND PSYCHO-LOGICAL FACTORS IN HIS LIFE 

The groping dissatisfaction wth the old system was so general that 
only a catalyst was needed to precipitate the crisis This catalyst was 
found in the son of Alois Schicklgruber (also spelled Schucklgriiber) 
who later changed his name to ‘Hitler’ There was a history of illegiti- 
macy m the family Rudolf Olden in his biography of Hitler says, ‘Hitler 
has given the simplest and clearest picture possible of conditions m his 
father’s home But u e have only to look at the facts to see that, far from 
being simple, the married life of his father was unusual and tempestuous 
Three wives, seven children, one divorce, one birth before marriage, two 
shortly after the wedding, one wife fourteen years older than himself and 
another twenty-three years younger — ^that is saying a good deal for a 
Customs officer ’ 

There were other impoitant circumstances in Adolf Hitler’s life 
which were influential and found their fulfillment in totalitarian systems 
(a) He was born from a peasant stock, by tradition prepared to carry a 
heavy load of work with persistency (b) He was baptized in the Cath- 
olic Church, an institution well known to have totalitarian orientations, 
and which up to this day m pnnaple proclaims authority over ‘all’ the 
Catholics in the world Having absorbed that totalitarian orientation 
from childhood up, which applies also to Mussolini, Stalin, etc , it was 
simple for those so trained to switch to state totalitarianism, where such 
leaders could find a ‘lebensraum’ for themselves as individuals, thus en- 
hancing their own ‘egos’, and incidentally filling their pockets No one 
who has actually studied the public appearances of various totalitarian 
‘fuhrers’ can miss the utter similanty between their reactions and the 
reactions of the mobs to them. They act like little ‘gods on wheels’, and 
the mobs react with unreasoned, blind, fanatical subjection, which the 
fuhrers and their aides know how to manufacture 

(c) Hitler was born into Austrian bureaucracy, one of the most in- 
efficient, dishonest, hypocritical, etc , bureaucracies m the world, perme- 
ated with the Hapsburg motto, ‘Divide et impera'. The older Schickl- 
gruber wanted his son also to become a Hapsburg bureaucrat Schickl- 
gruber, Jr had a natural repulsion for them, and so deliberately boy- 
cotted any education, to disqualify himself for such a fate This lack 
of education ostracized him from the class of so-called ‘intelligentsia’, 
to which a Hapsburg bureaucrat eventually belonged Through living 
necessities he had to become a plain labour hand, yet because of his para- 



xlii INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


noia tendencies, delusions of grandeur based on unhealthy worship of 
historical ‘heroes’, etc , he was also not acceptable to the plain workers, 
who are generally sane and do not look at life as a Wagnerian opera So 
in reality he found tliat he was not acceptable anywhere, belonged 
nowhere, a misfit everywhere, until he adhered to totalitarianism as a 
‘religion’ which he and his closest associates modified to suit the Prussian 
character, selected by them as a standard of German perfection, to be 
imposed on the rest of the world 

(d) When he joined the German army with its orderly efficiency, 
etc., he found an ideal for himself as an escape from Hapsburg decadence 
No matter how he hated the Hapsburg polite perfidy, he was too much 
of an Austnan not to utilize to the limit the Hapsburg methods Ulti- 
mately through this combination of methods he ‘out-Prussianed’ the 
Prussians, whose particular arrogant, brutal methods were never ap- 
proved and often disliked throughout the world and even in Germany 

I give these data as partial explanations of how through life and other 
circumstances the whole life of Hitler, as well as his political program, 
was based on hate, revenge and destruction of what he feared and hated 
as a person, driven by his delusions of persecution and grandeur It was 
only natural in his ‘chosen people’ delusion that he should hate and try 
to destroy other 'chosen people’ , obviously there is no place in this world 
for two or more ‘chosen people’ The absurdity of Hitler’s ignorant 
anthropological theories has been definitely established by science and 
history, and m fact are not taken seriously by many of the informed Nazi 
leaders themselves 

Some such analysis of a few of the more important factors in Hitler's 
life indicates how his ‘mental’ illness developed, involving ‘inferiority’ 
and ‘persecution’ complexes, etc , and explains why for his own comfort 
he surrounded himself personally with mostly psychopathological people, 
although their psychiatric classifications may be different 

Very soon psychiatric treatises will be written on the ‘Jehovah com- 
plex’ of Schicklgruber, Jr , etc. Perhaps the following quotations will 
illustrate how the ‘Jehovah’, as recorded in Exodus 19 and 20, is being 
copied today . 

‘Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my cove- 
nant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples . for 
all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a 
holy nation These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the 
children of Israel [Nazis] ’ 

Or, ‘I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee . . . out of the house 
of bondage [England] ’ 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xlni 


Or, ‘for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity 
of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth 
generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of 
them that love me and keep my commandments ’ 

Or, ‘An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt saciifice 
thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine 
oxen in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and 
I will bless thee ’ Etc , etc 

These suggestions are given only to indicate how psychiatrists can 
help future historians 

4 EDUCATION FOR INTELLIGENCE AND DEMOCRACY 

It may become clearer why I speak of a dying, aristotehan, two-valued 
system by giving examples of how this type of evaluation is at the founda- 
tion of present day confusions and terrors Thus, for instance, the Nazi 
militant delusion of ‘chosen people’ gives us an excellent illustiatioii of 
a two-valued, ‘either-or’ orientation The two-valued semantic twisting 
of ‘real neutrality’ is another sigmficant example This distortion has 
kept the ‘neutrals’ in terrors, disorganizing their national and political 
life to the point of complete collapse, whicli today is a historical fact. 
The Nazi two-valued evaluation of ‘neutrality’ was. either be ‘really 
neutral’ and endorse and fight for the Nazis, or be ‘not really neutral’ and 
not help them According to this orientation a ‘really neutral’ Belgium, 
Holland, Denmark, Norway, etc , should fight against England, France, 
etc , to prove that they are ‘really neutral’ ’ 

A similar analysis applies to the ‘aggression’ of China against Japan, 
Czechoslovakia against Germanj% Poland against Germany, Poland 
against Russia, Finland against Russia, Greece against Italy, etc , and so 
on endlessly, which shows only the pathological application of the two- 
valued, ‘either-or’ patterns in action This analysis applies also to the 
first World War and the ‘war guilt’ In a non-aristotehan orientation we 
ask for actual facts, and do not accept mere verbalism Who invaded 
whom^ The historical facts are simple We know by now who invaded 
whom, and never mind verbal definitions 

When analysed from a non-aristotelian point of view, such orienta- 
tions appear pathologically twisted Yet they produced results, as history 
shows It is not accidental that some years ago Hitler in one of his 
speeches took a definite stand for the prevailing aristoteliamsm, two- 
valued orientations, etc , and against modern science, which naturally 
develops in a non-aristotelian direction Quite soon whole volumes will

be written on this subject, here it is possible only to indicate tire main 
methodological issues involved 

Dr Irving J Lee in his article, ‘General Semantics and Public Speak- 
ing’. Quarterly Journal of Speech, December, 1940, formulates a fun- 
damental contrast between the types of ‘rhetorics’ of Aristotle and Hitler, 
and the iion-aristotehan type of communication found in general seman- 
tics which IS based on proper evaluation, made possible by thalamo- 
cortical integration 

We should not make the mistake of fancying that Hitler, etc , or the 
mikado are building a new non-anstotehan system, and a future new saner 
civilization It is only a rebellion within the old ‘either-or’ system, a chang- 
ing from one scheme of selfishness, greed and force to another cabal of sel- 
fishness, greed, and brute force, this time unavoidably lowering human cul- 
tural standards by training future generations in pathological abuses of 
neuro-semantic and neuro-lmguistic mechanisms, emasculating and 
misusing science, etc 

A non-anstotehan system must include considerations of neuro- 
semantic and neuro-hnguistic environments as environment Introduc- 
tions of such new factors necessitate a complete revision of all known 
doctrines, pet creeds, etc , and make possible the building of a science of 
man, which under the old aristotelian conditions was impossible The 
tabulation given here indicates some of the many older fictitious factors 
which have been eliminated as false to facts and destructive, while new, 
constructive factors have been introduced This by necessity requires 
the utilization of more adequate methods and techniques by which we can 
cope with a new world 

The new, non-anstotehan types of evaluations are forthcoming in 
every field of human endeavour, in science and/or life, necessitated by 
the urgencies of modern conditions The main problem today is to formu- 
late general methods by which these many separate attempts can be uni- 
fied into a general system of evaluation, which can become communicable 
to children and, with more difficulty, even to adults History shows that 
whenever older methods prove their inefficiency new methods are pro- 
duced which meet the new conditions more effectively. But the difficul- 
ties involved must first be clearly formulated before methods and tech- 
niques can be devised with which we can deal with them more success- 
fully 

It seems unnecessary to enlarge on the present day world tragedies 
because many excellent volumes have already been written and are con- 
tinuing to accumulate, psychiatric evaluations included I must stress, 
however, that no writer I know of has ever understood the depth of the

pending transition from the aristotelian system to an already formulated 
non-ariblutelian system This transition is much deeper than the change 
from merely one aristotelian ‘ism’ to anotlier 

We argue so much today about ‘democracy’ versus ‘totalitarianism’ 
Democracy presupposes intelligence of the masses ,* totalitarianism does 
not to the same degree But a ‘democracy’ without intelligence of the 
masses under modern conditions can be a worse human mess than any 
dictatorship could be ** Certainly present day education, while it may 
cram students’ heads with some data, without giving them any adequate 
methodological synthesis and extensional working methods, does not 
tram in ‘intelligence’ and how to become adjusted to life, and so does not 
work toward ‘democracy’ Experiments show that even a root can learn 
a lesson (see p. 120), and animals can learn by trial and error But we 
humans after these millions of years should have learned how to utilize 
the ‘intelligence’ which we supposedly have, with some predictability, etc , 
and use it constructively, not destructively, as, for example, the Nazis are 
doing under the guidance of specialists 

In general semantics we believe that some such thing as healthy 
human intelligence is possible, and so somehow we believe in the eventual 
possibility of ‘democracy’ We work, therefore, at methods which could 
be embodied even in elementary education to develop the coveted thala- 
nio-cortical integration, and so sane intelligence Naluially in our work 
prevention is the mam aim, and this can be accomplished only through 
education, and as far as the present is concerned, through i ^-education, 
and re-trainmg of the human nervous system 

Section I. Constructive suggestions 

As far back as 1933, on page 485 ff of the present book, I drew atten- 
tion to the human dangers of the abuse of neuro-semantic and neuro-lin- 
guistic mechanisms, with suggestions for preventive measures In Sep- 
tember, 1939, I advanced further constructive suggestions to some lead- 
ing governments, urging the employment of permanent boards of neuro- 
psychiatrists, psycho-logicians, and other specialists, to counteract similar 
dangers in connection with the present world crises I received only two 
polite acknowledgements of my letters But both forewarnings of 1933 
and 1939 have been disregarded in practice, even by specialists, with 
known disastrous results

xlvi INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


In the meantime the more far-sighted Nazi government employed a 
staff of specialists working at metliods to disorganize the nervous func- 
tioning of their adversaries which, as facts show, have worked very suc- 
cessfully and devastatmgly upon the unlucky citizens whom the short- 
sighted, unscientific, etc , governments never guided toward the proper 
use of their nervous systems, or safe-guarded from the abuses * 

Perhaps at present, 1941, after some irreparable harm has been done, 
the governments of the world will awaken and realize that the proper 
functioning of the nervous systems of their citizens is in many ways more 
important than any gun, battleship or aeroplane, etc , could possibly be, 
as there must be a Smithi behind the gun ! 

No matter who is finally ‘victorious’ m the present world struggle, no 
matter which way we look at it, the return to the old conditions is impos- 
sible A complete neuro-semantic and neuro-linguistic revision is inevi- 
table, and this revision is bound to lead away from anstotehanism. For 
this revision we are preparing the foundations in the formulations of gen- 
eral semantics Before any lasting adjustments in the future social, 
economic, political, ethical, etc , fields are accomplished we have to be 
able to evaluate properly and talk sense. Otherwise the situation is 
hopeless 

Obviously, regardless of what the ‘politicians’ may say, m every coun- 
try we necessarily have some kind of guidance by the government and 
executive power, no matter m what direction Even ‘complete lack of 
guidance’ must be considered guidance of some sort, in the direction, say, 
of ‘rugged individualism’, etc , which, if carried to the limit, becomes the 
unworkable ideal of anarchy In practical life such attitudes ultimately 
engender animal competition instead of human co-operation, and the very 
opposite of what we consider as the social feeling imperative for ‘democ- 
racy’ 

The real question is whether tlie existing governments are informed 
enough about human neurological problems, sanity, etc , and are intelli- 
gent enough, honest enough, etc , to guide and advise their people con- 
structively and efficiently in constantly emerging neurological situations 
such as occur in home and school lives, in national and international 
affairs, etc Unfortunately the answer is in the negative At present 
there is no such government I know of The Nazi government, on the 
other hand, has mobilized the psycho-logical knowledge available to them 
for destructive purposes, which must be professionally counteracted by 
the rest of the governments of the civilized world, if sanity is to prevail.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xlvii 


Depending on science for more and better killing machines is ceitainly 
not the solution for human problems, culture and civili7ation Without 
being sentimental, in a human avihzation humans matter more than 
machines, or symbols such as a ‘dollar’, a ‘pound sterling’, a ‘pound of 
flesh’, a ‘scalp’, etc , or such verbal generalizations as ‘liberty , ‘equality’, 
etc The living reactions of Smithi are more inipoi tant than the verbal- 
isms of Smithi, who nevertheless can shake the air w ith his verbal ti icks, 
as many of us too often do, affecting the nervous sj stems of others 

At present the totahtarians liave exploited neuro-semantic and neuro- 
linguistic mechanisms to their destiuctive limit, the best they knew how, 
to date Counteraction, reconstruction, and/or preiention arc impossible 
unless such mechanisms are utilized consti uctivcly under the guidance of 
governmental specialists in the fields of anthropology, neuro-ps 3 'chiatry, 
general semantics, etc , who would understand the language of their 
fellow workers in related scientific fields, and would be runu to dkvotk 

THEIR ENTIRE TIME AND EFFORTS TO THIS T ISK, AND TO FURTHER INVES- 
TIGATIONS 

Although practically all civilized states employ psychiatrists m their 
governmental hospitals for ‘mentally’ ill, these physicians are necessarily 
preoccupied with their patients and cannot undertake the special duties 
of the board I suggest Such a board would require the full time and 
attention of its members, as they would be called upon for consultation 
by various other governmental departments such as interior, state, laboui, 
commerce, health, army, navy, etc , and so special studies and co-ordi- 
nating knowledge in related branches of science would be essential 

It seems extremely short-sighted in 1941 that governments should 
employ permanently specialists in chemistry, physics, engineering, etc , 
other specialists who advise how to eliminate lice from poultry, raise pigs, 
conserve wild life, etc — ^and yet have no permanent consulting board of 
specialists who would advise how to conserve and prevent the abuse of 
human nervous systems Even a Chamberlain would have intelligence 
and/or honesty enough to pass a problem of a ‘magnetic mine’ to physi- 
cists and engineers, and not to party politicians, who know' nothing about 
such mechanisms, but would nevertheless be ready to debate ‘politically’ 
on the subject 

For example, if consulted, such a suggested body of governmental 
specialists would have studied Mem Kampf and various speeches of 
Hitler, Goebbels, etc , as a part of their duties, long ago, and would have 
advised their governments that psychopathological people are getting in 
control of world affairs and that their words cannot be trusted at all. 



xlvni INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION 


There would have been no ‘appeasements’, etc , and other measures would 
have been taken to cope with the depth of the problems involved 

It seems that the suggestions made on page 485 ff , although neces- 
sary, are not sufficient at the date of this writing, and the latest sugges- 
tions become imperative to safe-guard our future. 

CONCLUSION 

To summarize, under present world conditions the role of govern- 
ments IS becoming more and more difficult and important With all mod- 
ern complexities it is impossible for governmental men to be specialists 
in every field of science, and therefore they must depend on professional 
experts attached to the government, not only in the fields of chemistry, 
engineering, physics, agriculture, etc , which they already utilize , but also 
in anthropology, neuro-psychiatr)', general semantics, and related pro- 
fessions Otherwise the governments will indefinitely play the role of 
the blind leading the blind It is unreasonable to wait ten or twenty 
years to learn by bitter experience how short-sighted and incompetent 
our governments have been Why not utilize some human intelligence, 
proper evaluation, etc, toward which extensional methods lead, and 
thereby have some predictabthty This is definitely an imperative, 
immediate need 

We should not delude ourselves Once the psychopathological mis- 
uses of neuro-semantic and neuro-lmguistic mechanisms have been so 
successfully introduced, they will remain with us unless reconstructive 
and preventive governmental measures are undertaken by experts, at 
once 

The conditions of the world are such today that private scientific 
undertakings and even professional opinions of scientific societies, or in- 
ternational congresses, etc , are bound to be ineffective Only govern- 
mental interest, backing, financing, etc , can organize and enforce a seri- 
ous movement for sanity, the more so since scientists, physicians, edu- 
cators, and other professionals do not have the necessary time, money, 
authority, or even initiative to carry forward concerted plans We have 
learned this group wisdom by now m the case of smallpox vaccination, 
control of epidemics, etc , and I venture to suggest that only such group 
wisdom will be effective as far as tlie health of our nervous systems is 
concerned In terms of money certainly it would be economical to spend 
for preventive and permanent measures an amount even less than the cost 
of a single aeroplane which is made today and shot down tomorrow 

It must be sadly admitted that even professionals, no matter how 
prominent they may be in their narrow specialties, as individuals or spe- 



INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION xlix 


cialized groups are at present scientifically unequipped to deal with such 
large and complex problems as the passing from one system of orienta- 
tion to another, because those whose duty it was to integrate methodolog- 
ically the vast knowledge at hand, have failed Such conditions can be 
remedied only by diversified methodological investigations, co-opeiation, 
and concerted action of specialists in different fields, which no private 
undertaking can organize effectively The reader is referred to page 
558 ff and also to my ‘Science of Man’ * 

There can be little doubt that self-seeking politicians, to cover up their 
own tracks, will be against such scientific sanity guidance, but enlightened 
public opinion will sooner or later force the issues to the only possible 
intelligent solution 

The prevalent and constantly increasing general detenoiation of 
human values is an unavoidable consequence of the crippling misuse of 
Mewro-linguistic and neuro-semantic mechanisms In general semantics 
we are concerned with the sanity of the race, including particularly metli- 
ods of prevention , eliminating from home, elementary, and higher educa- 
tion inadequate aristotelian types of evaluation, which too often lead to 
the un-samty of the race, and building up for the first time a positive 
theory of sanity, as a workable non-aristotelian system 

The task ahead is gigantic if we are to avoid more personal, national, 
and even international tragedies based on unpredictability, insecurity, 
fears, anxieties, etc , which are steadily disorganizing the functioning of 
the human nervous system. Only when we face these facts fearlessly 
and intelligently may we save for future civilizations whatever there is 
left to save, and build from the rums of a dying epoch a new and saner 
society. 

I seriously appeal to scientists, educators, medical men, especially 
psychopathologists, parents, and other forward-looking citizens to inves- 
tigate and co-operate in urging the governments to carry out their duty 
to guide the people scientifically, as suggested here 

A non-anstotelian re-orientation is inevitable , the only problem today 
IS when, and at what cost

gratitude to Cornelius Crane, whose vision, interest, and financing made 
possible the founding of the Institute in 1938 The widespread influence 
and rapid development of the ivork of the Institute in this world turmoil 
became a living reality because of Mr Crane’s generous contributions 
during the first two and a half years of our pioneer effort Forces of 
destruction are working steadily, and Mr, Crane should be credited with 
helping to organize constructive efforts

SUPPLEMENTARY BIBLIOGRAPHY 

TO THE SECOND EDITION 

The following bibliography is only illustrative of points made in the introduction 
to the second edition A number of volumes listed here give extensive bibliographies 
m their fields For instance, the book of Dr Dunbar has 130 pages of bibliography 
which cover 2,358 items Some of the most important and latest empirical data on 
electrical brain-waves, electro-physiology, conditional reactions in humans, electro- 
colloidal processes of the nervous system, experimental neuroses and psychoses in 
animals, the reactions of apes, data on human psychotherapy, the methods ot decep- 
tion and sensory misdirection as utiliaed by magicians, etc , are given mostly in tech- 
nical journals and monographs, and the interested reader may find them in libraries 
This applies also to the many applications of the methods of general semantics 
in education, mental hygiene, speech difficulties, etc, carried on in universities and 
colleges, as well as applications in the practice of physicians, including psychiatrists , 
these are in preparation, or printed at present only by professional journals or by 
the Institute of General Semantics (see special list) 

I list also some new pertinent, professional publications such as PsychosoHiatic 
Medicine, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Encyclopedia of Unified Science, etc , without 
listing the titles of the individual contributions It is suggested that the interested 
reader, and particularly educators, medical men, etc , become acquainted with such 
material, or at least know that it does exist The reader is also referred to the fore- 
word to the bibliography given on page 767, and the titles which follow 

In science and life a great deal depends on proper evaluation, tested by predict- 
ability, which depends in turn on the similarity of structure between territory-map 
or fact-language Thus, we have to know scientific facts, as well as the intricacies 
and difficulties of language and its structure Fortunately there is a weekly Science 
News Letter, published by Science Service, Washington, D C , giving brief, authori- 
tative, non-technical factual summaries of progress in science, mathematics, medicine, 
etc, including sources, which every specialist as well as intelligent layman should 
know

It is difficult for a philosopher to realise that anyone really is confining 
his discussion within the limits that I have set before you The boundary 
IS set up just where he is beginning to get excited (573) A n whitehead 

That all debunkers must add new boshes of their own to supply the vacua 
created by the annihilation of the old, is probably a law of nature (22)

that to me? The answer is positive and weighty Our life is entirely de- 
pendent on the established doctrines of ethics, sociology, political economy,

unconsciously, the man in the street in the first place, because he is the

The mam portions of the present work have already been presented 
in the form of lectures before different universities, technological in- 
stitutes, teachers' and physicians' associations, and other scientific 
bodies The general outline was presented for the first time before the 
International Mathematical Congress in Toronto m 1924, and pub- 
lished in the form of a booklet A further elaboration of the system 
was read before the Washington (D C ) Society for Nervous and 
Mental Diseases in 1925, and the Washington (DC) Psychopatho- 
logical Society in 1926, and later published A fuller draft was pre- 
sented before the Congrcs des matliematiciens des pays Slaves, in War- 
saw, Poland, m 1929 A special and novel aspect of the subject, in 
connection with the conditional reflexes of Pavlov, was outlined before

C , in 1930. Other aspects were discussed before the American Mathe- 
matical Society, October 25, 1930, and the Mathematical Section of 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science, December 
28, 1931 The latter paper is printed as Supplement III in this 
volume 

The general character of the present work is perhaps best indicated 
by the two following analogies It is well known that for the working 
of any machine some lubricant is needed Without expressing any 
judgement about the present ‘machine age’, we have to admit that tech- 
nically It IS very advanced, and that without this advancement many 
scientific investigations necessitating very refined instruments would be 
impossible Let us assume that mankind never had at its disposal a 
clean lubricant, but that existing lubricants always contained emery 
sand, the presence of which escaped our notice Under such condi- 
tions, existing technical developments, with all their consequences, 
would be impossible Any machine would last only a few weeks or 
months instead of many years, making the prices of machines and the 
cost of their utilization entirely prohibitive Technical development 
would thus be retarded for many centuries Let us now assume that 
somebody were to discover a simple means for the elimination of emery 
from the lubricants ; at once the present technical developments would 
become possible, and be gradually accomplished 

Something similar has occurred in our human affairs Technically 
we are very advanced, but the elementalistic premises underlying our 
human relations, practically since Aristotle, have not changed at all 
The present investigation reveals that m the functioning of our nervous 
systems a special harmful factor is involved, a ‘lubricant with emery’ 
so to speak, which retards the development of sane human relations 
and prevents general sanity It turns out that in the structure of our 
languages, methods, ‘habits of thought’, orientations, etc , we preserve 
delusional, psychopathological factors. These are in no way inevitable, 
as will be shown, but can be easily eliminated by special training, 
therapeutic in effect, and consequently of educational preventive value 
This ‘emery’ m the nervous system I call identification It involves 
deeply rooted 'principles’ which are invariably false to facts and so our 
orientations based on them cannot lead to adjustment and sanity 

A medical analogy here suggests itself We find a peculiar parallel 
between identification and infectious diseases History proves that 
under primitive conditions infectious diseases cannot be controlled 
They spread rapidly, sometimes killing off more than half of the af- 
fected population The infectious agent may be transmitted either 



PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 


lix 


directly, or through rats, insects, etc With the advance of science, 
we are able to control the disease, and various important preventive 
methods, such as sanitation, vaccination, etc , are at our disposal 
Identification appears also as something ‘infectious’, for it is trans- 
mitted directly or indirectly from parents and teachers to the child 
by the mechanism and structure of language, by established and in- 
herited ‘habits of thought’, by rules for life-orientation, etc There 
are also large numbeis of men and women who make a profession 
of spreading the disease Identification makes general sanity and com- 
plete adjustment impossible Training in non-identity plays a thera- 
peutic role with adults The degree of recovery depends on many fac- 
tors, such as the age of the individual, the severity of the ‘infection’, 
the diligence in training in non-identity, etc W'lth children the train- 
ing in non-identity is extremely simple It plays the role both of 
sanitation and of the equally simple and effective preventive vaccina- 
tion 

As in infectious diseases, certain individuals, although living in 
infected territory, are somehow immune to this disease Others are 
hopelessly susceptible 

The present work is written on the level of the average intelligent 
layman, because before we can tram children in non-identity by pre- 
ventive education, parents and teachers must have a handbook for their 
own guidance It is not claimed that a millenium is at hand, far from 
it; yet it seems imperative that the wenro-psycho-logical factors which 
make general sanity impossible should be eliminated 

I have prefaced the parts of the work and the chapters with a 
large number of important quotations I have done so to make the 
reader aware that, on the one hand, there is already afloat in the ‘uni- 
verse of discourse’ a great deal of genuine knowledge and wisdom, and 
that, on the other hand, this wisdom is not generally applied and, to a 
large extent, cannot be applied as long as we fail to build a simple sys- 
tem based on the complete elimination of the pathological factors 

A system, in the present sense, represents a complex whole of co- 
ordinated doctrines resulting m methodological rules and principles 
of procedure which affect the orientation by which we act and live 
Any system involves an enormous number of assumptions, presup- 
positions, etc , which, m the mam, are not obvious but operate un- 
consciously As such, they are extremely dangerous, because should 
it happen that some of these unconscious presuppositions are false to 
facts, our whole life orientation would be vitiated by these unconscious 
delusional factors, with the necessary result of harmful behaviour and

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 


maladjustment No system has ever been fully investigated as to its 
underlying unconscious presuppositions Every system is expressed 
in some language of some structure, which is based in turn on silent 
presuppositions, and ultimately reflects and reinforces those presup- 
positions on and in the system This connection is very close and allows 
us to investigate a system to a large extent by a linguistic structural 
analysis 

The system by which the white race lives, suffers, ‘prospers’, 
starves, and dies today is not in a strict sense an aristotelian system 
Aristotle had far too much of the sense of actualities for that It 
represents, however, a system formulated by those who, for nearly two 
thousand years since Aristotle, have controlled our knowledge and 
methods of orientations, and who, for purposes of their own, selected 
what today appears as the worst from Aristotle and the worst from 
Plato and, with their own additions, imposed this composite system 
upon us In this they were greatly aided by the structure of language 
and psycho-logical habits, which from the primitive down to this very 
day have affected all of us consciously or unconsciously, and have 
introduced serious difficulties even in science and in mathematics 

Our rulers politicians, ‘diplomats’, bankers, priests of every de- 
scription, economists, lawyers, etc , and the majority of teachers re- 
main at present largely or entirely ignorant of modern science, scientific 
methods, structural linguistic and semantic issues of 1933, and they also 
lack an essential historical and anthropological background, without 
which a sane orientation is impossible * This ignorance is often wilful 
as they mostly refuse, with various excuses, to read modern works 
dealing with such problems As a result a conflict is created and main- 
tained between the advance of science affecting conditions of actual 
life and the orientations of our rulers, which often remain antiquated 
by centuries, or one or two thousand years The present world condi- 
tions are in chaos , psycho-logically there exists a state of helplessness — 
hopelessness, often resulting in the feelings of insecurity, bitterness, etc , 
and we have lately witnessed psychopathological mass outbursts, sim- 
ilar to those of the dark ages Few of us at present realize that, as long 
as such ignorance of our rulers prevails, no solution of our human 
problems ts possible 

* The literature of these subjects is very large and impossible to give 
here or in my bibliography, but as primers I may as well suggest numbers 
299, 334, 492, SS8, 589 in my bibliography These books in turn give further

The distinctly novel issue in a non-anstotelian system seems to be 
that in a human class of life elementary methodological and structural 
Ignorance about the world and ourselves, as revealed by science, is 
bound to introduce delusional factors, for no one can be free from 
some conscious or unconscious structural assumptions The real and 
only problem therefore seems to be whether our structural assump- 
tions in 1933 are primitive or of the 1933 issue The older 'populariza- 
tion of science’ is not the solution, it often does harm The pi ogress 
of science is due in the mam to scientific methods and linguistic revis- 
ions, and so the new facts discovered by such methods cannot be 
properly utilized by antiquated psycho-logical orientations and lan- 
guages Such utilization often results only m bewilderment and lack 
of balance Before we can adjust ourselves to the new conditions of 
life, created m the main by science, we must first of all revise our 
g;rossly antiquated methods of oiientation Then only shall we be able 
•to adjust ourselves properly to the new facts 

Investigations show that the essential scientific structural data of 
1933 about the world and ourselves are extremely simple, simpler even 
than any of the structural fancies of the primitives We usually have 
sense enough to fit our shoes to our feet, but not sense enough to revise 
our older methods of orientation to fit the facts The elimination of 
primitive identifications, which is easily accomplished once we take it 
seriously, produces the necessary psycho-logical change toward sanity 

‘Human nature’ is not an elementalistic product of heredity alone, 
or of environment alone but represents a very complex organism-as-a- 
whole end-result of the enviro-genetic manifold It seems obvious, 
once stated, that in a human class of life, the linguistic, structural, and 
semantic issues represent powerful and ever present environmental 
factors, which constitute most important components of all our prob- 
lems ‘Human nature’ can be changed, once we know how Experi- 
ence and experiments show that this ‘change of human nature’, which 
under verbal elementalism was supposed to be impossible, can be ac- 
complished in most cases m a few months, if we attack this problem by 
the non-elementahstic, nenro-psycho-logical, special non-identity tech- 
nique 

If the ignorance and identifications of our rulers could be eliminated 
a variety of delusional factors through home and school educational 
and other powerful agencies would cease to be imposed and enforced 
upon us, and the revision of our systems would be encouraged, rather 
than hampered Effective solutions of our problems would then appear 
spontaneously and in simple forms, our ‘shoes’ would fit our ‘feet’ and

we could ‘walk through life’ in comfort, instead of enduring the pres- 
ent sufferings 

Since our existing systems appear to be in many respects unwork- 
able and involve psychopathological factors owing in the main to cer- 
tain presuppositions of the aristotelian system, and also for brevity’s 
sake, I call the whole operating systemic complex ‘aristotelian’. The 
outline of a new and modern system built after the rejection of the 
delusional factors I call ‘non-anstotelian’ To avoid misunderstand- 
ings I wish to acknowledge explicitly my profound admiration for 
the extraordinary genius of Aristotle, particularly in consideration of 
the period in which he lived Nevertheless, the twisting of his system 
and the imposed immobility of this twisted system, as enforced for 
nearly two thousand years by the controlling groups, often under 
threats of torture and death, have led and can only lead to more dis- 
asters From what we know about Aristotle, there is little doubt that, 
if alive, he would not tolerate such twistings and artificial immobility 
of the system usually ascribed to him 

The connection between the study of psychiatry and the study of 
mathematics and the foundations of mathematics is very instructive 
In the development of civilization and science we find that some 
disciplines, for instance, the very young science of psychiatry, have 
progressed rapidly Other disciplines such as mathematics, physics, 
etc , until recently progressed slowly, mainly on account of certain 
dogmas and prejudices Of late some of these prejudices have been 
eliminated, and since then the progress of these sciences has become 
extremely rapid Still other disciplines such as ‘psychology’, the 
traditional ‘philosophy’, sociology, political economy, ethics, etc , have 
developed their principles very little in nearly two thousand years 
notwithstanding a wealth of accumulated new data 

Many reasons are responsible for this curious state of affairs, but 
I will suggest only three, in the order of their importance (1) First 
of all, the last mentioned slowly developing disciplines are the closest 
to us humans, and a primitive man, or an entirely ignorant person 
‘knows all about’ these most complex problems in existence This 
‘know It air general tendency produces an environmental, psycho- 
logical, linguistic, etc , manifold, filled with identifications which pro- 
duce dogmas, prejudices, misunderstandings, fears, and what not, mak- 
ing an impersonal, impartial scientific approach next to impossible 
(2) Few of us realize the unbelievable traps, some of them of a psy- 
chopathological character, which the structure of our ordinary lan- 
guage sets before us These also make any scientific approach or

agreement on vital points impossible We grope by animalistic trial 
and error, and by equally animalistic strife, wars, revolutions, etc 
These first two points apply practically to all of us, and introduce 
great difficulties even into mathematics (3) One of the main reasons 
why psychiatry has advanced so rapidly in such a short period in con- 
tradistinction to ‘psychology’, is that it studies relatively simple and 
relatively singled-out symptoms But as these symptoms are not iso- 
lated, and represent the reactions of the orgamsm-as-a-whole, their 
partial study yields glimpses of the general and fundamental mecha- 
nisms If we study mathematics and mathematical sciences as forms 
of human behaviour, we study also simplified and singled-out human 
reactions of the type ‘one and one make two’, ‘two and one make 
three’, etc , and we also get glimpses of general mechanisms In psy- 
chiatry we study simplified psycho-logical reactions at their worst; in 
mathematics and mathematical sciences we study simplified psycho- 
logical reactions at their best When both types of reactions are 
studied conjointly, most unexpected and very far-reaching results 
follow which deeply affect every known phase of human life and 
activity, science included The results of such widely separated studies 
do not conflict, but supplement each other, elucidating very clearly a 
general mechanism which operates in all of us Psychiatiical studies 
help us most unexpectedly in the solution of mathematical paradoxes, 
and mathematical studies help us to solve very important problems in 
psychotherapy and in prevention of psycho-logical disorders 

History shows that the advancement of science and civilization 
involves, first, an accumulation of observations, second, a preliminary 
formulation of some kind of ‘principles’ (which always involve some 
unconscious assumptions) , and, finally, as the numbers of observations 
increase, it leads to the revision and usually the rejection of unjusti- 
fied, or false to facts ‘principles’, which ultimately are found to repre- 
sent only postulates Because of the cumulative and non-elementalistic 
character of human knowledge, a mere challenge to a ‘principle’ does 
not carry us far For expediency, assumptions underlying a system 
have (1) to be discovered, (2) tested, (3) eventually challenged, 
(4) eventually rejected, and (5) a system, free from the eventually 
objectionable postulates, has to be built 

Examples of this abound in every field, but the histones of the 
non-euchdean and non-newtonian systems supply the simplest and 
most obvious illustrations. For instance, the fifth postulate of Euclid 
did not satisfy even his contemporaries, but these challenges were 
ineffective for more than two thousand years Only in the nineteenth 



Ixiv PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 

century was the fifth postulate eliminated and non-euchdean systems 
built without It The appearance of such systems marked a profound 
revolution in human orientations In the twentieth century the much 
more important 'principles’ underlying our notions about the physical 
world, such as 'absolute simultaneity', 'continuity' of atomic processes, 
'certainty' of our experiments and conclusions, etc , were challenged, 
and systems were then built without them As a result, we now have 
the magnificent non-newtonian physics and world outlooks, based on 
the work of Einstein and the quantum pioneers 

Finally, for the first time in our history, some of the most important 
'principles' of all principles, this time in the ‘mental world', were 
challenged by mathematicians For instance the universal validity of 
the so-called ‘logical law of the excluded third' was questioned Un- 
fortunately, as yet, no full-fledged systems based on this challenge 
have been formulated, and so it remains largely inoperative, although 
the possibilities of some non-aristotelian, though elementahstic and 
unsatisfactory ‘logics’, are made obvious 

Further researches revealed that the generality of the ‘law of the 
excluded third’ is not an independent postulate, but that it is only an 
elementahstic consequence of a deeper, invariably false to facts prin- 
ciple of ‘identity’, often unconscious and consequently particularly per- 
nicious Identity is defined as ‘absolute sameness in all respects’, and it 
IS this ‘all’ which makes identity impossible If we eliminate this ‘all’ 
from the definition, then the word ‘absolute’ loses its meaning, we have 
‘sameness in some respects’, but we have no ‘identity’, and only ‘simi- 
larity’, ‘equivalence’, ‘equality’, etc If we consider that all we deal with 
represents constantly changing sub-microscopic, interrelated processes 
which are not, and cannot be ‘identical with themselves’, the old dictum 
that ‘everything is identical with itself’ becomes m 1933 a principle in- 
variably false to facts 

Someone may say, ‘Granted, but why fuss so much about it^’ My 
answer would be, ‘Identification is found in all known primitive peoples , 
in all known forms of “mental” ills, and m the great majority of 
personal, national, and international maladjustments It is important, 
therefore, to eliminate such a harmful factor from our prevailing sys- 
tems ’ Certainly no one would care to contaminate his child with a 
dangerous germ, once it is known that the given factor is dangerous 
Furthermore, the results of a complete elimination of identity are so far- 
reaching and beneficial for the daily life of everyone, and for science,* 


♦While correcting the proofs of this Preface, I read a telegraphic press re- 
port from London by Science Service, that Professor Max Born, by the applica-

that such ‘fussing’ is not only justified, but becomes one of the primary 
tasks before us Anyone who will study the present work will be 
easily convinced by observations of human difficulties in life, and 
science, that the majority of these difficulties arise from necessary 
false evaluations, m consequence of the unconscious false to facts 
identifications 

The present work therefore formulates a system, called non- 
aristotelian, which is based on the complete rejection of identity and 
its derivatives, and shows what very simple yet powerful stiuclural 
factors of sanity can be found in science The experimental develop- 
ment of science and civilization invariably involves more and more 
refined discriminations Each refinement means the elimination of 
some identifications somewhere, but many still remain in a partial and 
mostly unconscious form The non-aristotelian system formulates the 
general problem of non-identity, and gives childishly simple non- 
elementalistic means for a complete and conscious elimination of 
identification, and other delusional or psychopathological factors in 
all known fields of human endeavours, m science, education, and all 
known phases of private, national, and international life This work, 
in its application to education and psychotherapy, has been experi- 
mental for more than six years 

The volume is divided into three mam divisions Book I gives a 
general survey of non-aristotehan structural factors discovered by 
science, which are essential m a textbook Only such data are 
selected, interpreted and evaluated as are necessary for a full mastery 
of the system Book II presents a general introduction to non-aristote- 
lian systems and general semantics free from identity, and gives a 
technique for the elimination of delusional factors from our psycho- 
logical reactions Book III gives additional structural data about lan- 
guages, and also an outline of the essential structural characteristics 
of the empirical world, but only such as are pertinent for training in 
the non-aristotelian discipline

major contribution to the formulation of a unified field theory which now in- 
cludes the quantum mechanics Should this announcement be ^ enfied in its scien- 
tific aspects, our understanding of the structure of ‘matter’, ‘electron’, etc , would 
be greatly advanced, and would involve of course most important practical appli- 
cations For the semantic aspects of these problems, see pp 378, 386 f , S41, 667,

I have tried to avoid footnotes as much as possible The small 
numbers after some words in the text refer to the Notes on p 763 ff , 
wheie the references to the bibliography are given 

Book II IS largely self-contained and therefore can be read inde- 
pendently of the others, after the reader has become acquainted with 
the short tables of abbreviations given on pp IS and 16, and with 
Chapters II and IV I believe, however, that for the best results the 
book should be read consecutively without stopping at passages which at 
first are not entirely clear, and read at least twice On the second read- 
ing, passages which at first were not clear will become obvious because, 
in such a wide system, the beginning presupposes the end, and vice 
versa 

The discovery of such important and entirely general delusional 
factors m the older systems leads to a far-reaching revision of all 
existing disciplines Because of modem complexities of knowledge 
this revision can only be accomplished by the activities of specialists 
working together as a group, and unified by one principle of non- 
identity, which necessitates a structural treatment 

To facilitate this most urgent need, and to present the results of 
this work to the public at reasonable prices, an International Non- 
aristotelian Library has been organized, to be printed and distributed 
by The Science Press Printing Company, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
USA, and Grand Central Terminal, New York City 

It IS also intended to organize an International Non-aristotelian 
Society with branches in connection with all institutions of learning 
throughout the world, where co-operative scientific work for the elimi- 
nation of identity can be earned out, as this work is beyond the capaci- 
ties of any one man 

Since the scope of the Library and Societies is international, I 
have accepted, in the main, the Oxford spelling and rules, which are 
a happy medium between the English used in the United States of 
America and that of the rest of the world In certain instances I had 
to utilize some forms of expressions which are not entirely customary, 
but these slight deviations were forced upon me by the character of the 
subject, the need for clarity, and the necessity for cautiousness in 
generalizations The revision of the manuscript and reading of the 
proofs in connection with other editorial and publishing duties has been 
a very laborious task foi one man, and I only hope that not too many 
mistakes have been overlooked Corrections and suggestions from the 
readers are invited

From one point of view, this enquiry has been independent, from 
another, much material has been adapted In some instances it is im- 
possible to give specific credit to an author, particularly m a text-

Young have been constantly consulted 

Although I have had no opportunity to use directly the funda- 
mental researches of Doctor Henry Head on aphasia, and particularly 
on semantic aphasia, my whole work has been seriously influenced by 
his great contributions Doctor Head’s work, in connection with a 
non-elementalistic analysis, makes obvious the close connection be- 
tween- (1) identifications, (2) structural ignorance, (3) lack of 
proper evaluations in general, and of the full significance of words and 
phrases in particular, and (4) the corresponding necessary, at least 
colloidal lesions of the nervous system

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 


I wish to express my deep appreciation to Doctor W A White 
and the staff of St Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington, D C , who, during 
my two years of study in the hospital, gave me every assistance to 
facilitate my research work there. I am indebted to Doctor P. S 
Graven for supplying me with his as yet unpublished experimental 
clinical material, which was very useful to me 

Three important terms have been suggested to me ; namely, ‘enviro- 
genetic’ by Doctor C B Bridges, ‘actional’ by Professor P W Bridg- 
man, and ‘un-sane’ by Doctor P S Graven, which debt I gladly 
acknowledge 

I am also deeply grateful to Professor R D Carmichael for writ- 
ing Supplement I for this book on the Theory of Einstein, and to 
Doctor P Weiss for his kind permission to reprint as Supplement II 
his article on the Theory of Types 

I warmly appreciate the kindness of those authors who gave me 
their permission to utilize their works 

During my twelve years of research work in the present subject 
and preparation of this volume I have been assisted by a number of 
persons, to whom I wish to express my appreciation My particular 
appreciation is extended to my secretary. Miss Lily E MaDan who, 
besides her regular work, made the drawings for the book, to Miss 
Eunice E Winters for her genuine assistance in reading the proofs 
and compiling the bibliography, and to Mr Harvey W. Culp for the 
difficult reading of the physico-mathematical proofs and the equally 
difficult preparation of the index 

The technical efficiency m all departments of the Science Press 
Printing Company, and the zealous and courteous co-operation of its 
compositors and officials, have considerably facilitated the publication 
of this book, and it is my pleasant duty to extend my thanks to them 
My heaviest obligations are to my wife, formerly Mira Edgerly 
This work was difficult, very laborious, and often ungrateful, which 
involved the renouncing of the life of ‘normal’ human beings, and we 
abandoned much which is supposed to make ‘life worth living’ With- 
out her whole-hearted and steady support, and her relentless encourage- 
ment, I neither would have formulated the present system nor written 
the book which embodies it If this book proves of any value, Mira 
Edgerly is in fact more to be thanked than the author. Without her 
interest, no non-aristotelian system, nor theory of sanity would have 
been produced in 1933.

A General Survey of 
Non-Aristotelian Factors 


Allow me to express now, once and for all, my deep respect for the work 
of the experimenter and for his fight to wring significant facts from an in- 
flexible Nature, who says so distinctly "No” and so indistinctly “Yes” to 
our theories csso) hekmann weyl 


The firm determination to submit to experiment is not enough , there are 
still dangerous hypotheses, first, and above all, those which are tacit and 
unconsc'ous Since we make them without knowing it, we are powerless to 
abandon them <417) h foincar^: 


The empiricist . thinks he believes only what he sees, but he is much 
better at believing than at seeing (46i) G Santayana 


For a Latin, truth can be expressed only by equations, it must obey laws 
simple, logical, symmetric and fitted to satisfy minds in love with mathe- 
matical elegance 

The Anglo-Saxon to depict a phenomenon will first be engrossed in mak- 
ing a model, and he will make it with common materials, such as our crude, 
unaided senses show us them He concludes from the body to the atom 
Both therefore make hypotheses, and this indeed is necessary, since no 
scientist has ever been able to get on without them The essential thing is 
never to make them unconsciously (4i7) H foincar^ 


If a distinction is to be made between men and monkeys, it is largely 
measurable by the quantity of the subconscious which a higher order of 
being makes conscious That man really lives who brings the greatest 
fraction of his daily experience into the realm of the conscious *

The thought of the painter, the musician the geometrician, the trades-

One need only open the eyes to see that the conquests of industry which 
have enriched so many practical men would never have seen the light, if 
these practical men alone had existed and if they had not been preceded by 
unselfish devotees who died poor, who never thought of utility, and yet 
had a guide far other than caprice (4i7) h. foincar^

In particular — if we use the word intelligence as a synonym for mental 
activity, as is often done — we must differentiate between the primitive forms 
of sensory intelligence, with their ill-developed symbolism beyond which 
backward children cannot advance, and the forms of verbal intelligence 
created by social education, abstract and conceptual forms C4il)

That IS precisely what common sense is for, to be jarred into uncommon

The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility 
of disco\ering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case As long as 
this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist 
(and of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine 
that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity (I 
would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on 
this point ) (ISO) A EINSTEIN 

Einstein, in thus analyzing what is involved in making a judgment of 
simultaneity, and in seizing on the act of the observer as the essence of the 
situation, is actually adopting a new point of view as to what the concepts 
of physics should be, namely, the operational view if we had adopted the 
operational point of view, we would, before the discovery of the actual 
physical facts, have seen that simultaneity is essentially a relative concept, 
and would have left room in our thinking for the discovery of such effects 
as were later found (55) p w bridgman

Let any one examine in operational terms any popular present-day dis- 
cussion of religious or moral questions to realize the magnitude of the re- 
formation awaiting us. Wherever we temporize or compromise in applying 
our theories of conduct to practical Me we may suspect a failure of opera- 
tional thinking, css) p w bridgman 

1 believe that many of the questions asked about social and philosophical 
subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined from the point of 
view of operations. It would doubtless conduce greatly to clarity of thought 
if the operational mode of thinking were adopted in all fields of inquiry as 
well as in the physical Just as in the physical domain, so in other domains, 
one is making a significant statement about his subject in stating that a 
certam question is meaningless (SS) p w bridgman 

There is a sharp disagreement among competent men as to what can be 
proved and what cannot be proved, as well as an irreconcilable divergence 
of opinion as to what is sense and what is nonsense (22) e. t dell

things, to define this word . that brought to grief the heroic attempt of 
Russell and Whitehead to put mathematical reasoning on a firm basis ( 22 )

To sum up, we can say that the fundamental grammatical categories, 
universal to all human languages, can be understood only with reference 
to the pragmatic Weltanshauung of primitive man, and that, through the 
use of Language, the barbarous primitive categories must have deeply in- 
fluenced the later philosophies of mankind (J 32 ) b malinowski 

Since no two events are identical, every atom, molecule, organism, per-

And these emergents are concatenated in such a way as to form vast rami-

attention of philosophers, owing to their avowedly anthropocentnc and 
anthropodoxic interests (SSS) uilli-vm morion wheeler

It IS terrible to see how a single unclear idea, a single formula without 
meaning, lurking in a young man's head, will sometimes act like an ob-

vigor and in the midst of intellectual plenty. (4o2) Charles s peirce

But exactly the distinctive work of science is the modification, the recon- 
struction, the abandonment of old ideas, the construction of new ones on 
the basis of observation This however is a distressing operation, and 
many refuse to undergo it , even many whose work is the practice of scientific 
investigation The old ideas persist along with the new observations, they 
form the basis — often unconsciously — for many of the conclusions that are 
drawn 

This IS what has occurred in the study of heredity A burden of concepts 
and definitions has come down from pre-experimental days, the pouring 
of the new wine of experimental knowledge into these has resulted in con- 
fusion And this confusion is worse confounded by the strange and strong 
propensity of workers in heredity to flout and deny and despise the ob- 
servations of the workers in environmental action , the equally strange and 
strong propensity of students of environmental effects to flout and deny and 
despise the work on inheritance If one accepts the affirmative results of 
both sets, untroubled by their negations, untroubled by definitions that 
have come from the past, there results a simple, consistent and useful body 
of knowledge, though with less pretentious claims than are set forth by 
either single set 

Our first fallacy springs from the situation just described It is 

I The fallacy of non-expenmental judgments, in matters of heredity 
and development 

Our second general fallacy is one that appears m the interpretation of 
observational and experimental results, it underlies most of the special 
fallacies seen in genetic biology This is the fallacy that Motley in his life 
of Gladstone asserts to be the greatest affliction of politicians, it is indeed 
a common plague of humanity It is

III The fallacy of concluding that because one factor plays a role, 

another does not, the fallacy of drawing negative conclusions from positive 
observations . . 

IV The fallacy that the characteristics of organisms are divisible into 
two distinct classes, one due to heredity, the other to environment , 

VII The fallacy of basing conclusions on implied premises that when 
explicitly stated are i ejected 

Many premises influencing reasoning are of this hidden, unconscious 
type Such ghostly premises largely affect biological reasoning on the topics 
here dealt with, they underlie several of the fallacies already stated, and 
several to come 

VIII The fallacy that showing a characteristic to be hereditary proves 
that It IS not alterable by the environment

IX. The fallacy that showing a characteristic to be altered by the en- 
vironment proves that it is not hereditary 

It appears indeed probable, from the present state of knowledge and the 
trend of discovery, that the following sweeping statements will ultimately 
turn out to be justified — 

(1) All characteristics of organisms may be altered by changing the 
genes; provided we can learn how to change the proper genes 

(2) All characteristics may be altered by changing the environmental 
conditions under which the organism develops, provided that we learn 
what conditions to change and how to change them 

(3) Any kind of change of characteristics that can be induced by alter- 
ing genes, can likewise be induced (if we know how) by altering conditions 
(This statement is open to more doubt than the other two, but it is likely 
eventually to be found correct ) . 

X. The fallacy that since all human characteristics are hereditary, 
heredity is all-important in human affairs, environment therefore unim- 
portant . . . 

XI The fallacy that since all important human characteristics are 
environmental, therefore environment is all-important, heredity unim- 
portant, in human affairs. (247) 9. s. jennings 



CHAPTER I 


AIMS, MEANS AND CONSEQUENCES OF A 
NON-ARISTOTELIAN REVISION 

The process of intellectuahsm is not the subject I wish to treat I wish 
to speak of science, and about it there is no doubt, by definition, so to 
speak, it will be intellectualistic or it will not be at all Precisely the ques- 
tion is, whether it will be wn H. foincarI; 

The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts 
. . . Seek simplicity and distrust it (S73) A n whitehead 

The present enquiry originated in my attempt to build a science of 
man. The first task was to define man scientifically m non-elementalistic, 
functional terms I accomplished that in my book Manhood of Human- 
ity (New York, E. P. Dutton & Co), and in it I called the special 
characteristic which sharply distinguishes man from animal the time- 
binding characteristic 

In the present volume I undertake the investigation of the mechan- 
ism of time-binding The results are quite unexpected We discover 
that there is a sharp difference between the nervous reactions of animal 
and man, and that judging by this criterion, nearly all of us, even now, 
copy* animals in our nervous responses, which copying leads to the 
general state of un-sanity reflected in our private and public lives, insti- 
tutions and systems By this discovery the whole situation is radically 
changed If we copy animals in our nervous responses through the lack 
of knowledge of what the appropriate responses of the human nervous 
system should be, we can stop doing so, both individually and collectively, 
and we are thus led to the formulation of a first positive theory of sanity 
The old dictum that we 'are’ animals leaves us hopeless, but if we 
merely copy animals in our nervous responses, we can stop it, and the 
hopeless becomes very hopeful, provided we can discover a physiological 
difference in these reactions Thus we are provided with a definite and 
promising program for an investigation 

Such an investigation is undertaken in the present volume. 

The result of this enquiry turned out to be a non-aristotelian sys- 
tem, the first to be formulated, as far as I know, and the first to express 
the very scientific tendency of our epoch, which produced the non- 
euchdean and non-newtonian (Einstein’s and the newer quantum theories) 
systems. It seems that these three, the non-aristotelian, non-euclidean 
and non-newtonian systems are as much interwoven and interdependent 

♦The use of the term ‘copy’ is explained in Chapter II

as were the corresponding older systems The aristotehan and the non- 
anstotehan systems are the more general, the others being only special 
and technical consequences arising from them 

Both the aristotehan and the non-aristotehan s> stems affect our 
lives deeply, because of ps)‘cho-logical factors and the immediacy of their 
application Each is the expression of the psycho-logical tendencies of 
its period Each in its period must produce in the younger generations 
a psycho-logical background which makes the understanding of its ap- 
propriate disciplines ‘natural’ and simple In an aristotehan human 
world the euclidean and newtonian systems are ‘natural’, while the youth 
educated in the non-aristotelian habits will find the non-euclidean and 
non-newtonian systems simpler, more ‘natural’, and the older systems 
‘unthinkable’ 

The functioning of the human nervous sjstem is a more generalized 
affair than that of the animal, with more possibilities The latter is a 
special case of the former, but not vice versa John Smith, through 
Ignorance of the mechanism, may use his neivous system as a Fido, but 
Fido cannot copy Smith Hence, the danger for Smith, but not for Fido 
Fido has many of his own difficulties for survival, but. at least, he has 
no self-imposed conditions, mostly sillj' and harmful, such as Smith has 
Ignorantly imposed on himself and others The field covered by this 
enquiry is very wide and imolves unexpectedly special suggestne con- 
tributions in diverse branches of science To list a few" for orientation 

1 The formulation of General Semantics, resulting from a General 
Theory of Time-biijdmg, supplies the scientists and the laymen with a 
general modern method of orientation, which eliminates the older psycho- 
logical blockages and reveals the mechanisms of adjustment , 

2 The departure from aristotehanism wull allow biologists, physiol- 
ogists, etc , and particularly medical men to ‘think’ m modern colloidal 
and quantum terms, instead of the inadequate, antiquated chemical and 
physiological terms Medicine may then become a science in the 1933 
sense ; 

3 In psychiatry it indicates on colloidal grounds the solution of the 
‘body-mind’ problem , 

4 It show's clearly that desirable human characteristics have a 
definite psychophyswlogical mechanism which, up till now', has been mis- 
used, to the detriment of all of us , 

5 It gives the first definition of ‘consciousness’ in simpler physico- 
chemical terms , 

6 A general theory of sanity leads to a general theory of psycho- 
therapy, including all such existing medical schools, as they all deal with

disturbances of the semantic reactions (psycho-logical responses to words 
and other stimuli in connection with their meanings') , 

7 It formulates a physiological foundation for ‘mental’ hygiene, 
which turns out to be a most general preventive psychophynological ex- 
perimental method , 

8 It shows the psychophysiological foundation of the childhood of 
humanity as indicated by the infantilism in our present pin ate, public, 
and international lives , 

9 In biology it gnes a semantic and structural solution of the 
‘organism-as-a-whole’ problem , 

10 In physiology and neurology it refoimulatcs to human levels the 
Pavlov theory of conditional reflexes, suggesting a new scientific field 
of psychophysiology for experiments , 

11 In epistemology and semantics it establishes a definite non- 
elementalistic theory of meanings based not only on definitions but also 
on undefined terms , 

12 It introduces a new development and use of ‘sti iictui c' , 

13 It establishes struct (ce. as the only possible content of 
knowledge ; 

14 It discovers the mnltwrdinaUty of the most important terms 
we have, thus removing the psycho-logical blockage of semantic origin 
and helping the a\ erage man or scientist to become a ‘genius’, etc , 

15 It formulates a new and physiological theory of mathematical 
types of extreme simplicity and i ery wide application , 

16 It offers a non-aristotelian solution of the problem of mathe- 
matical ‘infinity’ , 

17 It offers a new non-aristotelian, semantic (from Greek, to sig- 
nify) definition of mathematics and nuinbcr, which clarifies the mysteries 
about the seemingly uncanny iinportancc of number and measurement 
and throws a new' light on the role, structural significance, meaning, and 
methods of mathematics and its teaching, 

18 In physics, the enquiry' explains some fundaiT'cntal, but as yet 
disregarded, semantic aspects of phcsics m general, and of Einstein’s 
and the new quantum theories m particular , 

19 It resohes simph' the pioblcm of ‘indetcnninisin' of the newer 
quantum mechanics, etc 

I realize that the thoughtful reader may be staggered by such a 
partial list I am in full SMiipathy with him in this I also was staggered 

As this enquiry claims to be scientific, in the 1933 sense, I must 
explain how, m spite of great difficulties and handicaps, I was able to 
accomplish the work. As my work progressed, it turned out to be 



10 


I PRELIMINARIES 


‘speaking about speaking’ Now all scientific works in all fields are 
written or spoken, and so are ullurulely veibal In order to speak about 
speaking, in any satisfactory and fundamental 1933 sense, I had to 
become acquainted with the special languages used by scientists in all 
fields I did not realize beforehand what a very serious undertaking this 
was It took many years and much hard labour to accomplish it, but, once 
accomplished, the rest was simple Scientists do not differ from the 
rest of us They usually disregard entirely structural, linguistic, and 
semantic issues, simply because no one has, as yet, formulated these 
problems or shown their importance The structural revision of their 
language led automatically to new results and new suggestions, and 
hence the surprising list 

The present enquiry is limited and partial, but because it deals with 
linguistic and semantic issues and their physiological and psycho-logical 
aspects. It IS, as far as it goes, unusually general I found that, m 
writing, it IS extremely difficult and impracticable always to state ex- 
plicitly the limitations of a statement It seems most practical to say 
here that, in general, all statements heri^ made are limited by further 
considerations of the actualities of an analysed problem 

Thus, for instance, a ‘theory of sanity’ deals with the most im- 
portant semantic issues from limited semantic aspects, and has nothing 
to do with forms of ‘insanity’ arising from different organic, or toxic, 
or other disturbances, which remain as serious as ever The statements 
made cover just as much as further investigations will allow them to 
cover — and no more 

The reader should be warned against undue generalizations, as they 
may be unjustified It is impossible, at this stage, to foresee all the rami- 
fications of the present work The verbal issues, which correspond 
roughly to the older ‘mental’ issues, seem to pervade all human problems 
to some extent, and so the field of application and influence of any such 
enquiry must be very large Most of the results of the present work 
involve factors of unusual security of conclusion, though they may vio- 
late canons of our ‘philosophical’ creeds 

The explanation is astonishingly simple and easily verified The 
present non-aristotehan system is based on fundamental negative prem- 
ises ; namely, the complete denial of ‘identity’, which deflial cannot be 
denied without imposing the burden of impossible proof on the person 
who denies the denial If we start, for instance, with a' statement 
that ‘a word is not the object spoken about’, and some one tries to deny 
that, he would have to produce an actual physical object which would 
be the word, — impossible of performance, even in asylums for the ‘men-

tally’ ill. Hence my security, often 'blasphemously cheerful’, as one of 
my friends calls it 

This general denial of the ‘is’ of identity gives the mam funda- 
mental non-aristotelian premise, which necessitates a structural treat- 
ment The status of negative premises is much more important and 
secure to start with than that of the positive ‘is’ of identity, found in the 
aristotelian system, but easily shown to be false to fact, and involving 
important delusional factors 

Any map or language, to be of maximum usefulness, should, in 
structure, be similar to the structure of the empirical world Likewise, 
from the point of view of a theory of sanity, any system or language 
should, in structure, be similar to the structure of our nervous system. 
It is easily shown that the aristotelian system differs structurally from 
these minimal requirements, and that the non-aristotehan system is m 
accordance with them 


This fact turns out to be of psycho physiological importance The 
above considerations, and others impossible to mention m this chapter, 
have suggested to me the form and structure of the whole work. I have 
spared no effort to make the presentation as connected, simple, and, 
particularly, as workable as I could As I deal with structure, and simi- 
larity of structure, of languages and the empirical world, a definite selec- 
tion of topics IS immediately suggested I must give enough structural 
data about languages in general, and enough structural data about the 
empirical world, and then select, or, if necessary, build, my terminology 
and system of similar structure. 


The reader should not Jje afraid if some parts of the book look 
technical and mathema^&Tj^ reality, they are not so Speaking of the 
language called u structural point of view, I have had 
to illustrate few symbols or diagrams arc used

particularly among the white-collar class, is very large At present, I 
do not know any case where a thorough training in such a non-aristo- 
tehan semantic discipline would not give very serious means for better 
adjustment It will quiet down affective, semantic disturbances, sharpen 
orientation, j'udgement, the power of observation, and so forth, it will 
eliminate different psycho-logical blockages, help to overcome the very 
annoying and common ‘inferiority’ feelings, it will assist the outgrow- 
ing of the adult infantile state, which is a nervous deficiency practically 
always connected with some pathological sex-reactions or lack of normal 
and healthy impulses. 

After all, we should not be surprised at this Language, as such, 
represents the highest and latest physiological and neurological function 
of an organism It is unique with Smith and of uniquely hitman cir- 
cular structure, to use a logical term — or of spiral structure, to use a 
four-dimensional or a physico-chemical-aspect term Before we can use 
the semantic nervous apparatus properly, we must first know how to 
use It, and so formulate this use 


In these processes an ‘effect’ becomes a causative factor for future 
effects, influencing them in a manner particularly subtle, variable, flex- 
ible, and of an endless number of possibilities ‘Knowing’, if taken as 
an end-product, must be considered also as a causative psychophysio- 


logical factor of the next stage of the se ijjan tic response The disregard 
of this mechanism is potentially of seH^^iwiger, particularly in the

disregarHeri these striictiiral semantic issues and so was constructed on 
cruder ammaltsttc patterns 

The difficulty in passing from the old system to another of different 
structure is not in the non-aristotelian system as such, which is really 
simpler and more m accord with common sense , but the serious difficulty 
lies rather m the older habits of speech and nervous responses, and in 
the older semantic reactions which must be overcome These difficulties 
are, perhaps, more serious than is generally realized Only those who 
have experienced the passing from euclidean to non-euchdean, and from 
newtonian to noii-newtonian systems can fully appreciate this semantic 
difficulty; as a rule, it takes a new generation to do it painlessly and 
with entire success This applies to the general public, but is not an 
excuse for scientists, educators, and others who are entrusted with the 
education of, or who otherwise influence, the semantic reactions of 
children If any reader realizes his difficulties and seitoitsly ivants to 
overcome them, another suggestion may be given A structural diagram 
in the present work, called the Structural Differential, shows the struc- 
tural difference between the world of animal and the world of man 
This structural difference is not yet fully realized , neither is its semantic 
importance understood, as it has never been foiinulated in a simple way 
before , yet the permanent and instinctive realization of these structural 
differences is unconditionally necessary for the mastering of the present 
theory of sanity This diagram, indeed, involves all the psychophysio- 
logical factors necessary for the transition from the old semantic reac- 
tions to the new, and it gives in a tvay a structural summary of the whole 
non-aristotelian system As the diagiam is based on the denial of the 
‘is’ of identity, its use is practically indispensable , it has been made in 
relief and in printed forms, to be kept on the wall or the desk as a per- 
manent visual structural and semantic reminder Without actual hand- 
ling, poujting the finger or -waving the hand at it, seeing the order, and 
so on, it is practically impossible, or very difficult, to become trained, or 
to explain the present system to ourselves or others, because the foun- 
dation of all ‘knowing’ is stiuctural, and the Structural Differential 
actually shows this structural difference between the world of animal 
and the world of man 

One of the best ways for grown-up persons to tram themselves m 
the jpresent theory of sanity is to try to explain it to others, repeatedly 
poiptmg to the Structural Differential In my experience, those who 
ha-^e disregarded this adiice have always made very slow progress, and 
have never got the full semantic benefit of their efforts As regards the 
v^bal side of the training, it is as miportant to use exclusively the terms

I. PRELIMINARIES 


given in this book, which are non-anstotehan and non-elementalistic, as 
It is to abandon entirely the ‘is’ of identity and some of the eleinental- 
istic primitive terms 

The reader should be warned from the beginning of a very funda- 
mental semantic innovation ; namely, of the discovery of the multiordm- 
ahty of the most important terms we have This leads to a conscious 
use of these terms in the multiordmal, extremely flexible, full-of-con- 
ditionality sense Terms like ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘true’, ‘false’, ‘fact’, ‘reality’, 
‘cause,’ ‘effect’, ‘agreement’, ‘disagreement’, proposition’, ‘number’, ‘rela- 
tion’, ‘order’, ‘structure’, ‘abstraction’, ‘characteristic’, ‘love’, ‘hate’, 
‘doubt’, etc , are such that if they can be applied to a statement they can 
also be applied to a statement about the first statement, and so, ultimately, 
to all statements, no matter what their order of abstraction is Terms of 
such a character I call midtiordinal terms. The main characteristic of 
these terms consists of the fact that on different levels of orders of ab- 
stractions they may have different meanings, with the result that they 
have no general meaning , for their meanings are determined solely by the 
given context, which establishes the different orders of abstractions 
Psycho-logically, in the realization of the multiordmahty of the most im- 
portant terms, we have paved the way for the specifically human full 
conditionality of our semantic responses This allows us great freedom 
in the handling of multiordmal terms and eliminates very serious psycho- 
logical fixities and blockages, which analysis shows to be animalistic m 
their nature, and, consequently, pathological for man. Once the reader 
understands this multiordmal characteristic, this semantic freedom does 
not result in confusion 

Accidentally, our vocabulary is enormously enriched without becom- 
ing cumbersome, and is made very exact Thus a ‘yes’ may have an 
indefinite number of meanings, depending on the context to which it is 
applied Such a blank ‘yes’ represents, m reality, ‘yeSg,’, but this includes 
‘yesi’, ‘yesn’, ‘yess’, etc , all of which are, or may be, different All specu- 
lations about such terms in general — as, for instance, ‘what a fact or 
reality is^’ — are futile, and, m general, illegitimate, as the only correct 
answer is that ‘the terms are multiordmal and devoid of meaning outside 
of a context’ This settles many knotty epistemological and semantic 
questions, and gives us a most powerful method for promoting human 
mutual freedom of expression, thus eliminating misunderstandings and 
blockages and ultimately leading to agreement 

I suspect that without the discovery of the multiordmahty of terms 
the present work could not have been written, as I needed a more flexible 
language, a larger vocabulary, and yet I had to avoid confusion With

the introduction of the multiordmality of terms, which is a natural but, 
as yet, an unnoticed fact, our ordinary vocabulary is enormously en- 
riched , m fact, the number of words in such a vocabulary natural for 
man is infinite The multiordmality of terms is the fundamental mechan- 
ism of the full conditwnahty of human semantic reactions ; it eliminates 
an unbelievable number of the old animalistic blockages, and is funda- 
mental for sanity 

A number of statements in the present work have definite meanings 
for different specialists, often running entirely counter to the accepted 
scientific creeds As they followed naturally from the context, I inserted 
them for the specialist, without warning, for which I have to apologize 
to the general reader, although they will be useful to him also.

This book IS intended as a handbook, and I liave avoided referring 
the reader to other books, but have given as much of structural data as 
I deemed useful for a general orientation In a work of such wide 
scope and novelty, it seemed desirable to give a general outline rather 
than to elaborate in detail on some particular points, so that this work 
is not exhaustive in any field , nor, at present, can it be. 

The notes at the end of the book are given for the purposes 
(among others) of indicating sources of information, as an acknowl- 
edgement, and to facilitate the work of the future student. As much as 
I could. I have avoided direct quotations from other authors, because 
usually it has seemed more expedient to change the wording slightly. 
In many instances, I have followed the original wordings very closely, 
always giving the proper credit 

I have not avoided repetitions, because I have found, through sad 
experience, that many times, when I was reproached for a repetition, the 
hearer or reader was disregarding quite happily and unconsciously the 
said 'repetition’, as if he had never heard it before For such a work 
as the present one, the standard literary habits — ‘avoid repetitions’, ‘let 
the reader discover it for himself’ , are extremely detrimental to the 
understanding of a few fundamental issues and to the acquiring of A 
habits and new sr To facilitate the student’s task, I had no other choice 
than to write as I did 

In 1933, scientific opinion is divided as to whether we need more 
science or less science Some prominent men even suggest that scientists 
should take a vacation and let the rest of mankind catch up with their 
achievements There seems no doubt that the discrepancy between 
human adjustments and the advances of science is becoming alarming 
Is, then, such a suggestion justified? 

The answer depends on the asswnpHons underlying such opinions 
If humans, as such, have reached the limit of their nervous development, 
and if the scientific study of man, as man, should positively disclose 
these limitations, then such a conclusion would be justified But is this 
the case ?

The present investigation shows most emphatically that this is not 
the case All sciences have progressed exclusuely because they have 
succeeded m establishing their own^^ languages. For instance, a science 
of thermodynamics could not have been built on the terms of ‘cold’ and 
‘warm’. Another language, one of relations and structure, was needed , 
and, once this was produced, a science was born and progress secured 
Could modern mathematics be built on the Roman notation for numbers 
— I, II, III, IV, V ? No, it could not The simplest and most child- 
like arithmetic w'as so difficult as to require an expert , and all progress 
was very effectivel} hampered by the sjnibohsm adopted History shows 
that only since the unknown Hindu discovered the most revolutionary 
and modern principle of positional notation — 1, 10, 100, 1000 , modern 
mathematics has become possible Ever}' child today is more skilful in 
his arithmetics than the experts of those days Incidentally, let us notice 
that positional notation has a definite structui e 

Have we ever attempted anything similar in the study of man? 
As-a-whole? In all his actiiities? Again, most emphatically. No I We 
have never studied man-as-a-w hole scientifically If we make an attempt, 
such as the present one, for instance, we discoier the astonishing, yet 
simple, fact that, even now, we all copy animals m our nervous re- 
sponses, although these can be brought to the human level if the differ- 
ence in the mechanism of responses is discoi ered and formulated 

Once this is understood, we must face another necessity To abolish 
the discrepancy between the advanceqjent of science and the power of 
adjustment of man, we must first establish the science of man-as-a- 
w'hole, embracing all his actuities, science, mathematics and ‘mental’ ills 
not excluded Such an anal} ais would help us to discover the above- 
mentioned diflference m responses, and the s ? in man would acquire new 
significance 

If the present work has accomplished nothing more than to suggest 
such possibilities, I am satisfied Otheis, I hope, will succeed where I 
may have failed Under such conditions, the only feasible resort is to 
produce a science of man, and thus have not less, but more, science, 
ultimately covering all fields of human endeavour, and thereby putting 
a stop to the animalistic ncr\ous reactions, so vicious m their effects 
on man 

j^teAt present, now here in the. w'orld are there such psycliophysiological 
I^Hches being made There are large sums of money invested m dif- 
H^mt well-established institutions for scientific research, for ‘mental’

|mly the most important of all lines of research; namely, a general

science of man m all aspects of his behaviour, science, mathematics, and 
‘mental’ ills included 

It is to be hoped that, m the not-too-distant future, some individuals 
and universities will awaken to the fact that language is a fundamental 
psychophyswlogica! function of man, and that a scientific investigation 
of man in all his activities, is a necessary, pressing, very promising, and 
practical undertaking Then, perhaps, special chairs will be established 
m universities, and some such researches in semanttc reactions and san- 
ity will command as much interest and public encouragement as other 
scientific investigations 

‘ I, personally, have no doubt that this would mark the beginning of 
a new era, the scientific era, in which all human desirable chaxacteristics 
would be released from the present animalistic, psychophysiological, A 
semantic blockages, and that sanity would prevail 

That this IS not a dream, and that such nervous mechanisms pro- 
ducing blockages do exist, has been demonstrated by Pavlov on his dogs, 
by all psychotherapy, and the experiments now being made on the 
elimination of the disturbances of the sr The abundance of geniuses 
among younger physicists, since the emsteinian structural revolution and 
semantic release, is also an important empirical evidence that different 
man-made verbal systems can stimulate or hamper the functioning of the 
human nervous system 

What has been said here has very solid structural, neurological 
foundations For our purpose, we may consider a rough structural differ- 
ence between the nervous systems of man and animal Briefly, we can 
distinguish in the brain two kinds of nervous fibres, the radiating pro- 
jection fibres and the tangential correlation and association fibres With 
the increase of complexities and modifiability of the behaviour, we find 
an increased number and more complex interrelations of association 
fibres The mam difference, for instance, between the brain of a man 
and the brain of a higher ape is found not in the projection apparatus, 
but in the association paths, which are enormously enlarged, more numer- 
ous, and more complex m man than in any animal Obviously, if these 
association paths are blocked to the passage of nervous impulses by 
some psychophysiological process, the reactions of the individual must 
be of a lower order, and such blockage must give the effect of the givei^ 
individual’s being organically deficient, and must, therefore, reg 
animalistic behaviour 

The present investigation discloses that the sr may assume^ 
diversified forms, one of which is the production of very powe 
psychophysiological blockages These, when once we understand tf 
mechanism, can be eliminated by proper education and training in a]l 
propnate J r 



CHAPTER II 


TERMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS 


The representation of mental phenomena in the form of reactions, con- 
ditioned reflexes, Bechterew's 'psycho-reflexes,' leads to a truly physio- 
logical schematization . (4it) henri fiI^ron 

Now I claim that the Ethnographer’s perspective is the one relevant 
and real for the formation of fundamental linguistic conceptions and for 
the study of the life of languages, whereas the Philologist's point of view 
is fictitious and irrelevant . . To define Meaning, to explain the essential 
grammatical and lexical characters of language on the material furnished 
by the study of dead languages, is nothing short of preposterous in the 
light of our argument (332) B Malinowski 


If he contend, as sometimes he will contend, that he has defined all his 
terms and proved all his propositions, then either he is a performer of 
logical miracles or he is an ass, and, as you know, logical miracles arc im- 
possible (3fi4) CASSIUS J KEYSER 


Finally, in semantic aphasia, the full significance of words and 'phrases 
IS lost Separately, each word or each detail of a drawing can be undei- 
stood, but the general significance escapes, an act is executed upon com- 
mand, though the purpose of it is not understood Reading and writing 
are possible as well as numeration, the correct use of numbers, but the 
appreciation of arithmetiiail processes is defective . . A general concep- 
tion cannot be formulated, but details can be enumerated. (4ii) 

HENRI PitRON 

Moreover, the aphasic patient in his mode of life, in his acts and in all 
his behaviour may seem biologically and socially normal But he has 
nevertheless suffered an unquestionable loss, for he no longer has any 
chance of undergoing further modifications of social origin, and of reacting 
in his turn as a factor in evolution and progress (4ii) henri fi£ron 


Particularly it expresses that most important step in the treatment, the 
passing over from a mere intellectual aixeptance of the facts of the analysis, 
whether in interpretation of the underlying complexes or in recognition of 
the task to be accepted, to an emotional appreciation and appropriation 
of the same liitelkclual acceptance can work no cure but may prove seri- 
ously misleading to the patient who is attempting to grasp the situation 
and to the beginner in analysis as well (24i) smith ely jelliffe 


Section A On semantic reactions 

The term semantic reaction is fundamental for the present work and 
non-elenientalistic systems The term 'semantic' is derived from the 
Greek semantikos, ‘significant’, from sematnein ‘to signify’, ‘to mean’, 
and was introduced into literature by Michel Breal in his Essat de 
Scmantiqiic The term has been variously used in a more or less gen- 
eral or restricted sense bv different writers Of late, this term has been 
used by the Polish School of Mathematicians, and particularly L Chwis-

tek (see Supplement III), A. F BentleyS and has been given a medical 
application by Henry Head“ in the study of different forms of Apliasias 
‘Aphasia’, from the Greek aphasia, ‘speechlessness’, is used to describe 
disorders in comprehension or expression of written and spoken lan- 
guage which result from lesions of the brain Disturbances of the 
semantic reactions iii connection with faulty education and ignorance 
must be considered in 1933 as sitb-microscopic colloidal lesions 

Among the man}' subdivisions of the symbolic disturbance, we find 
semantic aphasia, to be described (after Head) as the want of recogni- 
tion or the full significance or intention of words and phrases, combined 
with the loss of power of appreciating the ‘ultimate or non-verbal mean- 
ing of words and phrases’ to be investigated presently, and the failure to 
recognize the intention or goal of actions imposed upon the patient 

The problems of ‘meaning’ are very complex and too little investi- 
gated, but it seems that ‘psychologists’ and ‘philosophers’ are not entirely 
in sympathy with the attitude of the neurologists It is necessary to show 
that in a ^-system, u Inch involves a new theory of meanings based on 
non-el semantics, the neurological attitude toward ‘meaning’ is the only 
structurally correct and most useful one 

The explanation is quite simple ^^’e start with the negative A 
premise that words are not the un-speakable objective level, such as 
the actual objects outside of our skin and our personal feelings inside 
our skin It follow's that the only link between the objective and the 
verbal world is exclusively structural, necessitating the conclusion that 
the only content of all ‘knowledge’ is structural. Now structure can be 
considered as a complex of relations, and ultimately as multi-dimensional 
order 

From this point of view, all language can be considered as names 
either for un-speakable entities on the objective level, be it things or 
feelings, or as names for relations In fact, even objects, as such, could 
be considered as relations between the sub-microscopic events and the 
human nervous system If we enquire what the last relations represent, 
we find that an object represents an abstraction of low order pro- 
duced by our nervous system as the result of the sub-microscopic events 
acting as stimuli upon the nervous system If the obj’ects represent 
abstractions of some order, then, obviously, when we come to the enquiry 
as to language, we find that words are still higher abstractions from 
objects Under such conditions, a theory of ‘meaning’ looms up natur- 
ally. If the objects, as well as words, represent abstractions of different 
order, an individual. A, cannot know what B abstracts, unless B tells 
him, and so the ‘meaning’ of a word must be given by a definition This 



TERMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS

would lead to the dictionary meanings of words, provided we could define 
all our words But this is impossible If we were to attempt to do so, 
we should soon find that our vocabulary was exhausted, and we should 
reach a set of terms which could not be any further defined, from lack 
of words We thus see that all linguistic schemes, if analysed far 
enough, would depend on a set of undefined terms If we enquire about 
the ‘meaning’ of a word, we find that it depends on the ‘meaning’ of 
other words used m defining it, and that the eventual new relations 
posited between them ultimately depend on the m o meanings of the 
undefined terms, which, at a given period, cannot be elucidated any 
further. 

Naturally, any fundamental theory of ‘meaning’ cannot avoid this 
issue, which must be crucial Here a semantic experiment suggests 
Itself I have performed this experiment repeatedly on m}'self and 
others, invariably with similar results Imagine that we are engaged 
in a friendly serious discussion with some one, and that we decide to 
enquire into the meanings of words For this special experiment, it is 
not necessary to be very exacting, as this would enormously and unneces- 
sarily complicate the experiment It is useful to have a piece of paper 
and a pencil to keep a record of the progress 

We begin by asking the ‘meaning’ of every word uttered, being 
satisfied for this purpose with the roughest definitions , then we ask the 
‘meaning’ of the words used in the definitions, and this process is con- 
tinued usually for no more than ten to fifteen minutes, until the victim 
begins to speak in circles — as, for instance, defining ‘space’ by ‘length’ 
and ‘length’ by 'space' When this stage is reached, we have come usually 
to the undefined terms of a given individual If we still press, no matter 
how gently, for definitions a most interesting fact occurs Sooner or 
later, signs of affective disturbances appear Often the face reddens, 
there is a bodily restlessness , sw eat appeal s — symptoms quite similar to 
those seen in a schoolboy who has forgotten his lesson, w'hich he ‘knows 
but cannot tell’ If the partner in the experiment is capable of self- 
observation, he invariably finds that he feels an internal affective pres- 
sure, connected, perhaps, with the rush of blood to the brain and prob- 
ably best expressed in some such words as 'what he "knows” but cannot 
teir, or the like Here we have reached the bottom and the foundation 
of all non-eleinentahstic meanings — the meanings of undefined terms, 
which we ‘know'’ somehow, but cannot tell In fact, we have reached the 
un-speakable level This ‘know'ledge’ is supplied by the lower nerve 
centres , it represents affective first order effects, and is interwoven and 
interlocked with other affective states, such as those called ‘wishes’.

I PRELIMINARIES 


‘intentions’, ‘intuitions’, ‘evaluation’, and many others It should be 
noticed that these first oidei elTects have an objective character, as they 
are un-speakable — ^are not words 

‘Meaning’ must be considered as a multiordinal term, as it applies 
to all levels of abstractions, and so has no general content We can only 
speak legitimately of ‘meanings’ in the plural Perhaps, we can speak 
of the meanings of meanings, although I suspect that the latter would 
represent the un-speakable first order effect, the affective, personal raw 
material, out of which our ordinary meanings are built 

The above explains structurally why most of our ‘thinking’ is to 
such a large extent ‘wishful’ and is so strongly coloured by affective 
factors Creative scientists know very well from observation of them- 
selves, that all creative work starts as a ‘feeling’, ‘inclination’, ‘suspicion’, 
‘intuition’, ‘hunch’, or some other un-speakable affective state, which only 
at a later date, after a sort of nursing, takes the shape of a verbal ex- 
pression, worked out later in a rationalized, coherent, linguistic scheme 
called a theory In mathematics we have some astonishing examples of 
intuitively proclaimed theorems, which, at a later date, have been proven 
to be true, although the original proof was false 

The above explanation, as well as the neurological attitude toward 
‘meaning’, as expressed by Head, is non~elementalistic We have not 
illegitimately split organismal processes into ‘intellect’ and ‘emotions’ 
These processes, or the reactions of the organism-as-a-whole, can be 
contemplated at different neurological stages in terms of order, but must 
never be split or treated as separate entities This attitude is amply 
justified structurally and empirically in daily and scientific life For in- 
stance, we may assume that educated Anglo-Saxons are familiar with 
the Oxford Dictionary, although it must be admitted that they are handi- 
capped m the knowledge of their language by being born into it , yet we 
know from experience how words which have one standard definition 
carry different meanings to, and produce different affective individual 
reactions on, different individuals Past experiences, the knowledge , of 
different individuals are different, and so the evaluation (affective) of 
the terms is different We are accustomed to such expressions as ‘it 
means nothing to me’, even in cases when the dictionary wording is 
accepted , or ‘it means a great deal to me’, and similar expressions which 
indicate that the meanings of meanings are somehow closely related to, 
or perhaps represent, the first order un-speakable affective states or 
reactions. 

Since ‘knowledge’, then, is not the first order un-speakable objective 
level, whether an object, a feeling , structure, and so relations, becomes 



TERMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS 


23 


the only possible content of ‘knowledge’ and of meanings On the lowest 
level of our analysis, when we explore the objective level (the un- 
speakable feelings in this case), we must try to define every ‘meaning’ as 
a conscious feeling of actual, or assumed, or wished , relations which 
pertain to first order objective entities, psycho-logical included, and which 
can be evaluated by personal, varied, and racial — again un-speakable first 
order — psychophysiological effects Because relations can be defined as 
multi-dimensional order, both of which terms are non-el, applying to 
‘senses’ and ‘mind’, after naming the un-speakable entities, all experience 
can be described in terms of relations or multi-dimensional order The 
meanings of meanings, m a given case, in a given individual at a given 
moment , represent composite, affective psycho-logical configurations of 
all relations pertaining to the case, coloured by past experiences, state of 
health, mood of the moment, and other contingencies 

If we consistently apply the organism-as-a-whole principle to any 
psycho-logical analysis, we must conjointly contemplate at least both 
aspects, the ‘emotional’ and the ‘intellectual’, and so deliberately ascribe 
‘emotional’ factors to any ‘intellectual’ manifestation, and ‘intellectual’ 
factors to any ‘emotional’ occurrence. That is why, on human levels, the 
el term ‘psychological’ must be abolished and a new term psycho-logical 
introduced, in order that we may construct a science 

From what has been said, we see that not only the structure of the 
world IS such that it is made up of absolute individuals, but that mean- 
ings m general, and the meanings of meanings in particular — the last 
representing probably the un-speakable first order effects — also share, in 
common with ordinary objects, the absolute individuality of the objective 
level 

The above explains why, by the inherent structure of the world, 
life, and the human nervous system, human relations are so enormously 
complex and difficult, and why we should leave no stone unturned to 
discover beneath the varying phenomena more and more general and 
invariant foundations on which -human understanding and agreement 
may be based In mathematics we find the only model in which we can 
study the invariance of relations under transformations, and hence the 
need for future psycho-logicians to study mathematics 

It follows from these considerations that any psv cho-logical occur- 
rence has a number of aspects, an ‘affective’, and an ‘intellectual’, a 
physiological, a colloidal, and what not For the science of psychophysiol- 
ogy, resulting m a theory of sanit>, the above four aspects are of most 
importance As our actual lives are lived on objective, un-speakable 
levels, and not on verbal levels, it appears, as a problem of evaluation.

that the objective level, including, of course, our un-speakable feelings, 
‘emotions’ , is the most important, and that the verbal levels arc only 
auxiliary, sometimes useful, but at present often harmful, because of the 
disregard of the j r The role of the auxiliary verbal levels is only ful- 
filled if these verbal processes are translated back into first order effects 
Thus, through verbal intercourse, m the mam, scientists discover useful 
first order abstractions (objective), and by verbal intercourse again, 
culture IS built , but this only when the verbal processes affect the un- 
speakable psycho-logical manifestations, such as our feelings, ‘emotions’, . 

Some extraordinary parrot could be taught to repeat all the verbal 
‘wisdom’ of the world , but, if he survived at all, he would be just a par- 
rot The repeated noises would not have affected his first order effects — 
his affects — ^these noises would ‘mean’ nothing to him 

Meanings, and the meanings of meanings, with their inseparable 
affective components, give us, therefore, not only the non-elementalishc 
foundation on which all civilization and culture depends, but a study of 
the non-el mechanisms of meanings, through psychophysiology and 
general semantics, gives us, also, powerful physiological means to achieve 
a host of desirable, and to eliminate a large number of undesirable, 
psycho-logical manifestations 

The physiological mechanism is extremely simple and necessitates a 
breaking away from the older elementalism But it is usually very diffi- 
cult for any given individual to break away from this older elementalism, 
as It involves the established j r, and to be effective is, by necessity, a 
little laborious The working tool of psychophysiology is found in the 
semantic reaction This can be described as the psycho-logical reaction 
of a given individual to words and language and other symbols and 
events m connection with their meanings, and the psycho-logical reac- 
tions, which become meanings and relational conUgwi ahons the moment 
the given individual begins to analyse them or somebody else does that 
for him It IS of great importance to realize that the term ‘semantic’ is 
non-elcinentalisHc, as it involves conjointly the ‘emotional’ as well as 
the ‘intellectual’ factors 

From the non-el point of view, any affect, or impulse, or even 
human instinct, when made conscious acquires non-el meanings, and 
becomes ultimately a psycho-logical configuration of desirable or undesir- 
able to the individual relations, thus revealing a workable non-el mechan- 
ism Psychotherapy, by making the unconscious conscious, and by ver- 
balization, attempts to discover meanings of which the patient was not 
aware If the attempt is successful and the individual meanings are 
revealed, these are usually found to belong to an immature period of

evaluation m the patient's life They are then consciously revised and 
rejected, and the given patient either improves or is entirely relieved 
The condition for a successful treatment seems to be that the processes 
should be managed ui a non-el ementahsHc way Mere verbal formalism 
IS not enough, because the full non-elementalistic meanings to the patient' 
are not divulged , consequently, m such a case, the s r are not affected, 
and the treatment is a failure 

The non-el study of the s r becomes an extremely general scientific 
discipline The study of relations, and therefore order, reveals to us 
the mechanism of non-el meanings , and, in the application of an ordinal 
physiological discipline, we gam psychophysiological means by ^\hlch 
powerfully to affect, reverse, or even annul, undesirable sr In psycho- 
physiology we find a non-el physiological theory of meanings and sanity. 

From the present point of view, all affective and psj cho-logical 
responses to words and other stimuli invohnug meanings are to be con- 
sidered as s r What the relation between such responses and a corres- 
ponding persistent psycho-logical state may be, is at present not clear, 
although a number of facts of observation seem to suggest that the 
re-education of the sr results often m a beneficial change in some of 
these states But further investigation in this field is needed 

The realization of this difference is important m practice, because 
most of the psycho-logical manifestations may appear as evoked by 
some event, and so are to be called responses or reflexes Such a 
response, when lasting, should be called a given state, perhaps a semantic 
state, but not a semantic reflex The term, ‘semantic reaction’, will be 
used as covering both semantic reflexes and states In the present work, 
we are interested in sr, from a psychophj siological, theoretical and 
experimental point of view, which include the corresponding states 

If, for instance, a statement or any e\ent evokes some iiidividiiars 
attention, or one tram of associations m prefeience to another, or en\y. 
or anger, or fear, or prejudice , we would have to speak of all such 
responses on psycho-logical levels as j r A stimulus was present, and a 
response followed, so that, by definition, ue should speak of a reaction 
As the active factor m the stimulus uas the individual meanings to 
the given person, and his response had meanings to him as a first order 
effect, the reaction must be called a semantic reaction 

The present work is written entirely from the sr point of view, 
and so the treatment of the material, and the language used, imply, in 
general, a psycho-logical response to a stimulus m connection with 
meanings, this response being expressed by a number of such words as 
‘implies’, ‘follows’, ‘becomes’, ‘evokes’, ‘results’, ‘feels’, ‘reacts’, ‘evalu-

ates’, and many others All data taken from science are selected, and only 
those which directly enter as factors in jr are given in an elementary 
outline The meanings to the individual are dependent, through the 
influence of the environment, education, languages and their structure, 
and other factors, on racial meanings called science, which, to a large 
extent, because of the structural and relational character of science, 
become physiological semantic factors of the reactions In fact, science, 
mathematics, ‘logic’ , may be considered from a non-elemeiitalisHc point 
of view as generaheed results of j r acceptable to the majority of informed 
and not heavily pathological individuals 

To facilitate the writing and the reading of the work, I am com- 
pelled to use definite devices As in case of structure, multiordinal terms, 
so in the case oi sr,l often employ an ordinary form of expression and 
use the words ‘structural’, ‘multiordinal’, ‘semantic’, as adjectives, or 
‘structurally’, ‘semantically’ , as adverbs, always implying the full mean- 
ings, that under such and such conditions of a given stimulus, the given 
j r would be such and such In many instances, the letters sr or ( j r) 
will be inserted to remind the reader that we deal with semantic reactions 
or the psycho-logical reactions in connection with the meanings of the 
problems analysed It is not only useful, but perhaps essential, that the 
reader should stop in such places and try to evoke in himself the given sr 
The present work leads to new J r which are beneficial to every one of us 
and fundamental for sanity The casual reading of the present book is 
not enough Any one who wants the full or partial benefit of the joint 
labours of the author and the reader must, even in the reading, begin to 
re-train his s r 

As the organism works as-a-whole, and as the training is psycho- 
physiological in terms of order, reversing the reversed pathological order , 
organism-as-a-whole means must be employed For this purpose, the 
Structural Differential has been developed The reader will later under- 
stand that it IS practically impossible to achieve, without its help, the 
maximum beneficial semantic results 

From a non-el point of view, which makes illegitimate any el verbal 
splitting of ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’ , these processes must be analysed 
in terms of order, indicating the stages of the psycho-neural process-as- 
a-whole Empirically, there is a difference between an ‘emotion’ which 
becomes ‘rationalized’ and ‘emotions’ invoked or produced by ‘ideas’. 
The order is different in each instance, and if, m a given nervous system, 
at a given moment, or under some special conditions, the lower or higher 
nerve centres work defectively, the nervous reactions are not well bal- 
anced and the -manifestations acquire a one-sided character The other

aspect is not abolished, but is simply less prominent or less effective 
Thus, in morons, imbeciles, and m many forms of infantilism, the ‘think- 
ing’ IS very ‘emotional’ and of a low grade , in so-called ‘moral imbeciles’, 
and perhaps m ‘schizophrenia’, the ‘thinking’ may be seemingly ‘normal’, 
yet It does not affect the ‘feelings’, which are deficient 

From the non-el semantic human point of view, any affect only 
gains meanings when it is conscious , or, in other words, when an actual 
or assumed set of relations is present In an ideally balanced and efficient 
human nervous system, the ‘emotions’ would be translated into ‘ideas’, 
and ‘ideas’ translated into 'emotions’, imth equal facility In other 
words, the sr of a given individual would be under full control and 
capable of being educated, influenced, transformed quickly and efficiently 
— the very reverse of the present situation The present enquiry shows 
that the lack of psychophysiological methods for training and lack of 
analysis and understanding of the factors involved, are responsible for 
this deplorable situation 

' The above processes are quite obvious on racial grounds, if we 
study science and mathematics from the semantic point of view With 
very few exceptions, we only fail individually For instance, a Euclid 
and a Newton had ‘hunches’, ‘intuitions’ , then they rationalized and ver- 
balized them and so affected the rest of us and established the ‘natural’ 
feeling for E geometries, N mechanics , When new Eor R systems were 
produced, many of the older scientists could ‘understand’ them, could 
even master the new symbolic technique , yet their ‘feelings' , were sel- 
'dom affected They ‘thought’ in the new way, but they continued to ‘feel’ 
in the old, their sr did not follow fully the transformation of their 
‘ideas’, and this produced a split personality 

Any fundamentally new system involves new sr, and this is the 
main difficulty which besets us when we try to master a new system We 
must re-educate, or change, our older sr As a rule, the younger genera- 
tion, which began with the new s r. has no such difficulties with the new 
systems Just the opposite — the older j r become as difficult or impossible 
to them as the new were to the older generation To both generations, 
with their corresponding sr, the non-habitual sr are ‘new’, no matter 
what their historical order and how difficult or how simple they are 
However, there is an important difference The newer s\ stems, as, for 
instance, the E, N, and the p'reseiit corresponding H-system, are more 
general which means that the newer systems include the older as particu- 
lar cases, so that the younger generation has s r nhich are more flexible, 
more condiHonal, with a broader outlook , semantic conditions absent in 
the older systems.

The problems connected with the j r are not new, because these are 
inherent in nun, no matter on what low or primitive level or on what 
high level of development he may be , but, up to the undertaking of the 
present analysis, the problems of r r were not formulated, their psycho- 
physiological mechanisms were not discovered, and so, to the detriment 
of all of us, we have had no workable educational means by which to 
handle them effectively. 

That IS why the passing from one era to another is usually so diffi- 
cult and so painful The new involves new j r, while, as a rule, the older 
generations have enforced their systems, and, through them, by means of 
controlled education and linguistic structure and habits, the old s r This 
the younger generation, always having more racial experience, cannot 
accept, so that revolutions, scientific or otherwise, happen, and, when 
successful, the new systems are imposed on the older generation without 
the older generation’s changing their s r All of which is painful to all 
concerned The next generation after such a ‘revolution’ does not have 
similar difficulties, because from childhood they are trained in the new 
sr, and all appears as ‘natural’ to them, and the older as ‘unthinkable’, 
‘silly’. 

As a descriptive fact, the present stage of human development is 
such that with a very few exceptions our nervous systems do not work 
properly in accordance with their survival structure In other words, 
although we have the potentialities for correct functioning in our nervous 
system, because of the neglect of the physiological control-mechanism of 
our j r, we have semantic blockages in our reactions, and the more bene- 
ficial manifestations are very effectively prevented 

The present analysis divulges a powerful mechanism for the control 
and education of sr , and, by means of proper evaluation, a great many 
undesirable manifestations on the psycho-logical level can be very effi- 
ciently transformed into highly desirable ones In dealing with such a 
fundamental experimental issue as the j r, which have been with us since 
the dawn of mankind, it is impossible to say new things all the time. 
Very often the issues involved become ‘common sense’ ; but what is the 
use, in practice, of this ‘common sense’, if it is seldom, if ever, applied, 
and in fact cannot be applied because of the older lack of workable 
psychophysiological formulations^ For instance, what could be simpler 
or more ‘common sense’ than the A premise that an object is not words , 
yet, to my knowledge, no one fully applies this, or has fully acquired the 
corresponding j r Without first acquiring this new j r, it is impossible to 
discover this error and corresponding j r in others , but as soon as we 
have trained ourselves, it becomes so obvious that it is impossible to miss

It We shall see, later, that the older ^ r were due to the lack of structural 
investigations, to the old structure of language, to the lack of conscious- 
ness of abstracting, to the low order conditionality of our conditional 
reactions (the semantic included), and a long list of other important fac- 
tors All scientific discoveries involve sr, and so, once formulated, and 
the new reactions acquired, the discovenes become ‘common sense’, and 
we often wonder why these discoveries were so slow m coming in spite 
of their ‘obviousness’ These explanations are given because they also 
involve some jr, and we must warn the reader that such evaluations 
( j r) ‘Oh, a platitude >’, ‘A baby knows that’, are very effective sr to 
prevent the acquisition of the new reactions This is why the ‘discovery 
of the obvious’ is often so difficult, it involves very many of semantic 
factors of new e\ aluation and meanings 

A fuller evaluation is only reached at present on racial grounds in 
two or more generations, and never on individual grounds, which, of 
course, for personal genet alised adjustment and happiness, is very detri- 
mental Similarly, only in the study of racial achievements called science 
and mathematics can we discover the appropiiate sr and the nervous 
mechanism of these so varied, so flexible, and so fundamental reactions. 

In fact, without a structural formulation and a A revision based on 
the study of science and mathematics, it is impossible to discover, to con- 
trol, or to educate these j r For this reason it was necessary to analyse 
the semantic factors in connection vv ith brief and elementary considera- 
tions taken from modern science But, when all is said and done, and the 
important semantic factors discovered, the whole issue becomes extremely 
simple, and easily applied, even by persons without much education In 
fact, because the objective levels are not words, the only possible aim of 
science is to discover structure, which, when formulated, is ahvays simple 
and easily understood by everj'one, vv ith the exception, of course, of very 
pathological individuals We have already seen that structure is to be con- 
sidered as a configuration of relations, and that relations appear as the 
essential factors in meanings, and so of s r The present enquiry, because 
structural, reveals vital factors of j r The consequences are extremely 
simple, yet very important We see that by a simple structural re-editca- 
tton of the j r, which in the great mass of people are still on the level of 
copying animals m their nervous reactions, we powerfully affect the sr, 
and so are able to impart very simply, to all, in the most elementary edu- 
cation of the jr of the child, cultural results at present sometimes 
acquired unconsciously and painfully in university education 

The above considerations have forced upon me the structure of the 
present work and the selection and presentation of the material Of

course, the reader can skip many parts and at once plunge into Part VII, 
and discover that it is all ‘childishly simple’, ‘obvious’ and ‘common 
sense’ Such a reader or a critic with this particular j r would miss the 
point, which can be verified as an experimental fact in the meantime, that 
in spite of its seeming simplicity, no one, not even the greatest genius, 
fully applies these ‘platitudes’ outside of his special work, which j r, in 
his limited field, represent the semantic components that make up 
his genius 

The full acquisition of the new sr requires special training, but, 
when acquired, it sohes for a given individual, without any outside inter- 
ference, all important human problems I know of It imparts to him 
some of the jr of so-called ‘genius’, and thus enlarges his so-called 
‘intelligence’. 

The problems of the structure of a given language are of extieme, 
and as yet unrealized, semantic importance Thus, for instance, the \\ hole 
Einstein theory, or any other fundamental scientific theory, must be con- 
sidered as the building of a new language of similar structure to the 
empirical facts known at a given date In 1933, the general tendency of 
science, as made particularly obvious in the works of J Loeb, C. M 
Child, psychiatry, the Einstein theory, the new quantum mechanics , and 
the present n ork, is to build languages which take into consideration the 
many important invariant relations, a condition made possible onh by 
the use of non-el languages In my case, I must construct a non-el lan- 
guage in uhich ‘senses’ and ‘mind’, ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’ , aie no 
longer to be verbally split, because a language in which they arc split is 
not similar in structure to the known empirical facts, and all speculations 
in such an el language must be misleading 

This non-el language invoh es a new non-el theory of meanings, as 
ijust explained The term ‘semantic’, ‘semantically’, ‘semantic reactions’, 
I ‘semantic states’ , are non-el, as they involve both ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’, 
since they depend on ‘meanings’, ‘evaluation’, ‘significance’, and the like, 
based on structure, relations, and ultimately multi-dimensional order All 
these terms apply equally to ‘senses’ and to ‘mind’, to ‘emotions’ and to 
‘intellect’ — they are not artificially split 

It IS important to preserve the non-el or organism-as-a- whole .ilti- 
tude and terminolog}' throughout, because these represent most inipoi lant 
factors in our sr Sometimes it is necessary to emphasize the origin, ni 
the relative importance, of a given aspect of the impulse or reaction, or to 
translate for the reader a langpiage not entirely familiar to him into one 
to which he is more accustomed In such cases, I use the old el terms in 
quotation marks to indicate that I do not eliminate or disregard the o they 



TERMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS 31

aspects — a disregard which otherwise w'ould be implied by the use of the 
old terms 

The term psycho-logical will always be used either with a hyphen to 
indicate its non-el character, or in quotation marks, without a hyphen, 
when we refer to the old elementalism Similarly, with the terms psycho- 
logies, psycho-logicians, for ‘psychology’ and ‘pyschologist’. The terms 
‘mental ills', ‘mental hygiene’ are unfortunate ones, since they are used 
by the majority as el Psychiatrists, it is true, use them in the organism- 
as-a-whole sense to include ‘emotions’ Because of the great semantic 
influence of the structure of language on the masses of mankind, leading, 
as it does, through lack of better understanding and evaluation \.o specula- 
tion OH terms, it seems advisable to abandon completely terms which 
imply to the many the suggested elementalism, although these terms are 
used in a proper non-el way by the fexv 

If specialists, to satisfy their s r, disregard these issues and persist 
in the use of el terms, or use such expressions as ‘man is an animal’ and 
the like, they misunderstand the importance of semantic factors Through 
, lack of appreciation or of proper evaluation of the problems involved, 
they artificially and most effectively prevent the rest of us from follow- 
ing their work without being led astray by the inappropriate structure 
of their language The harm done through such practices is quite serious, 
and, at present, mostly disregarded For this reason, I either use quota- 
tion marks on the terms ‘mental’, ‘mental’ ills, ‘mental’ hygiene , or else I 
use the terms psycho-logical, semantic ills, psycho-logical or semantic 
hygiene,. The above two terms are not only non-el but also have an 
important advantage of being international The terms ‘affects’, ‘affec- 
tive’ are little used outside of scientific literature, where they are used 
mostly in the non-el ordinal sense I use them m a similar way, without 
quotation marks 

All the issues involved in the present work are, of necessity, inter- 
connected Thus, order leads to relations, relations to structure, and 
these, in turn, to non-el meanings and evaluations, which are the funda- 
mental factors of all psycho-logical states and responses, called more 
specifically semantic reactions, states, and reflexes The reader should 
be careful to remain at all times aware of these connections and implica- 
tions. Whenever we find order, or relations, or structure, m the outside 
world, or m our nervous system, these terms, because of their non-el 
character, imply similar order relations, and structure in our psycho- 
logical processes, thus establishing meanings, proper evaluations , ulti- 
mately leading toward appropriate s r The reverse applies also. When- 



32 


I. PRELIiHNARIES 


i 

ever we speak of s r, non-cl meanings, structure, relations, and, final!} 
order, are implied. 

The use of non-el languages is seriously beneficial, as it is structur- 
ally more correct and establishes s.r which are more appropriate, more 
flexible, or of higher order conditionality, a necessity for the optimum 
working of the human nervous system, — ^all of which results folloiv auto- 
matically from the structure of the language used. 

A non-el, structurally correct, but non- formulated attitude is a pn- 
vate benefit Once it is formulated m a non-e! language, it becomes a 
public benefit, as it induces m others the non-el attitudes, thus transform- 
ing the former sr In this wa} , a ‘feeling’ has been translated structur- 
ally into language, which, in turn, through structure, involves other 
people’s attitudes and ‘feelings’, and so their r r 

The whole process is extremely simple, elementary, and automatic, 
yet, before we acquire the new sr, we find difficulties because of the 
fundamental novelty of these reactions Any persistent student will 
acquire them easily, provided he does not expect too rapid a progress 
The subject matter of the present analysis is closely related to the ‘feel- 
ings’ of everybody , yet the difficulties in acquiring the new reactions are 
similar to those the older scientists found in acquiring the J r necessary 
for mastering the E and X s} stems 

In physics, we often need ‘space-like’ or ‘time-like’ inten als, although 
the non-el implications of the term ‘inten-al’ remain Similarly, in our 
problems when we are interested in the ‘emotion-like’ or ‘mind-like’ 
aspects of the non-el s r, we shall indicate the special aspects by using the 
old terms in quotation marks This method prevents wasteful and futile 
speculations on el terms, and serves as a reminder that the other aspects 
are present, although in a given discussion we do not deem them to be 
important The above has, by itself, very far-reaching semantic influence 
on our reactions 

From what has already been said, it is clear that the terminology of 
semantic reactions , covers in a non-el w'ay all psycho-logical reactions 
which w'ere formerly covered by el terms of ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’, 
the reactions themselves always being on the objective le\els and 
un-speakable As j r can always be analysed into terms of meanings and 
evaluation, and the latter into terms of structure, relations, and multi- 
dimensional order, w'hich imolves phy'siological factors, the term ‘seman- 
tic’ ultimately appears as a physiological or rather psychophysiological 
term It suggests workable and simple educational methods which will 
be explained later The reader should notice that the use of a language 



TERMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS 


33 


of a new structure has led to new results, which, m turn, directly affect 
our sr 

An important point should be stressed , namely, that the issues are 
fundamentally simple, because they are similar in structure to the struc- 
ture of human ‘knowledge’ and to the nervous structure on which so-called 
‘human nature' depends Because of this similarity, it is unconditionally 
necessary to become fully acquainted with the new terms of new struc- 
ture, and to use them habitually Only then will the beneficial results 
follow All languages have some structure , and so all languages involve 
automatically the, of necessity, interconnected r r Any one who tries to 
translate the new language into the old while ‘thinking’ in the older 
terms is confronted with an inherent neurological difficulty and involves 
himself m a hopeless confusion of his own doing The reader must be 
warned against making this mistake 

In the present work, I have tried to realize fully my duties toward 
my reader , and I am certain that the reader who will read the book dili- 
gently and repeatedly will be repaid for his labours The realization that 
some problems do e.vist, even if we do not fully appreciate or understand 
them, has very serious semantic influence on all of us Realizing my 
responsibilities toward the reader, I have not spared difficult labour in 
order to bring these semantic facts to his attention I seriously suggest 
that no reader ought to disregard Parts VIII, IX, and X, but that he 
should become at least acquainted with the existence of the problems 
there discussed If this is conscientiously done, many beneficial sr will 
appear sooner or later. 

The present system is an interconnected whole the beginning implies 
the end, and the end implies the beginning Because of this characteristic, 
the book should be read at least tzmce, and preferably oftener I wish 
positively to discourage any reader who intends to give it merely a 
superficial reading 

The problems of j r have not, so far, been analysed at all from the 
point of view of structure, and the present enquiry is, as far as my 
knowledge goes, the first m existence The problems of meanings are 
vast, extremely important, and very little analysed The interested reader 
will find some material in the excellent critical review of the problems 
of meanings in Ogden’s and Richards’ The Meaning of Meaning, m some' 
parts of Baldwin’s Thought and Things or Genetic Logic, and in Lady 
Welby’s article in the Encyclopaedia Britanmca on Signifies In these 
three studies, a partial literature of the subject is given 

The present work involves issues taken from many and diverse 
branches of knowledge which have not hitherto been seen to be connected.

What is of importance is that the issues presented should be sound in 
the main, even if not perfect in details, which often have no bearing on 
the subject Specialists in the fields here analjsed should pass their pro- 
fessional judgement as to the soundness of their special paits of the sjs- 
tem They do not need even to be enthusiastic, it is enough if they 
approve it The mam issue is the building of a /f-system, which 
co-ordinates many disconnected fields of knowledge on the basis of struc- 
ture, from the special point of view of non-el sr If these results have 
been accomplished, the author is satisfied. 

Section B. On the unspeakable objective level 

The term ‘un-speakable’ expresses exactly that which we have up 
to now practically entirely disregarded, namely, that an object or feeling, 
say, our toothache, is not verbal, is not words Whatever we may say 
will not be the objective level, which remains fundamentally un-speakable 
Thus, we can sit on the object called ‘a chair’, but we cannot sit on the 
noise we made or the name we applied to that object It is of utmost 
importance for the present /4-system not to confuse the verbal level with 
the objective level, the more so that all our immediate and direct ‘mental’ 
and ‘emotional’ reactions, and all s r, states, and reflexes, belong to the 
un-speakable objective levels, as these are not words This fact is of 
great, but unrealized, importance for the training of appropriate s r We 
can tram these reactions simply and effectnely by ‘silence on the objec- 
tive levels’, using familiar objects called ‘a chair’ or ‘a pencil’, and this 
training automatically affects our ‘emotions’, ‘feelings’, as well as other 
psycho-logical immediate responses difficult to reach, which are also not 
words We can tram simply and effectively the s r inside our skins by 
training on purely objective and familiar grounds outside our skins, 
avoiding unnecessary ps} cho-logical difficulties, yet achieving the desired 
semantic results The term ‘un-speakable’ is used m its strict English 
meaning The objective level is not words, can not be reached by words 
alone, and has nothing to do w ith ‘good’ or ‘bad’ , neither can it be 
understood as ‘non-expressible by words’ or ‘not to be described by 
words’, because the terms ‘expressible’ or ‘described’ already presuppose 
words and symbols Something, therefore, which we call ‘a chair’ or ‘a 
toothache’ may be expressed or described by words , yet, the situation is 
not altered, because the given description or expression will not be the 
actual objective level which we call ‘a chair’ or ‘a toothache’. 

Semantically, this problem is genuinely crucial Any one who misses 

— and it is unfortunately easily missed — will miss one of the most

important psycho-logical factors in all j r underlying sanity This omis- 
sion IS facilitated greatly by the older systems, habits of thought, older 
s r, and, above all, by the primitive structure of our language and the 
use of the ‘is’ of identity Thus, for instance, we handle what we call a 
pencil Whatever we handle is un-speakable , yet we say ‘this is a pencil’, 
which statement is unconditionally false to facts, because the object 
appears as an absolute individual and ts not words Thus our j r are at 
once trained in delusional values, which must be pathological 

I shall never forget a dramatic moment in my experience I had a 
very helpful and friendly contact prolonged over a number of years with 
a very eminent scientist After many discussions, I asked if some of the 
special points of my work were clear to him His answer was, ‘Yes, it is 
all right and so on, but, how can you expect me to follow your work all 
through, if I still do not know what an object It was a genuine 
shock to me The use of the little word ‘is’ as an identity term applied 
to the objective level had paralysed most effectively a great deal of hard 
and prolonged work Tet, the semantic blockage which prevented him 
from acquiring the new ^ r is so simple as to seem trifling, in spite of the 
semantic harm done The definite answer may be expressed as follows • 
‘Say whatever you choose about the object, and whatever you might say 
IS not It ’ Or, in other words ‘Whatever you might say the object “is”, 
well It IS not’ This negative statement is final, because it is negative 
I have enlarged upon this subject because of its crucial semantic 
importance Whoever misses this point is missing one of the most vital 
factors of practically all j r leading toward sanity The above is easily 
verified In my experience I have never met any one, even among scien- 
tists, who would fully apply this childish ‘wisdom’ as an instinctive ‘feel- 
ing’ and factor m all his j r I want also to show the reader the extreme 
simplicity of a /^-system based on the denial of the ‘is’ of identity, and to 
forewarn him against very real difficulties induced by the primitive struc- 
ture of our language and the j r connected with it Our actual lives are 
lived entirely on the objective levels, including the un-speakable ‘feelings’,! 
‘emotions’ , the verbal levels being only auxiliary, and effective only itj 
they are translated back into first order un-speakable effects, such as an' 
obj'ect, an action, a ‘feeling’ , all on the silent and un-speakable objective 
levels In all cases of which I know at present, where the retraining of 
our sr has had beneficial effects, the results were obtained when this 
‘silence on the objective levels’ hcis been attained, which affects all our 
psycho-logical reactions and regulates them to the benefit of the organism 
and of his survival adaptation

Section C. On ‘copying’ in our nervous leactions 

The selection of the term ‘copying’ was forced upon me after much 
meditation Its standard meaning implies ‘reproduction after a model’, 
applicable even to mechanical processes, and although it does not exclude, 
it does not necessarily include conscious copying. It is not generally 
realized to what an important extent copying plays its role in higher 
animals and man 

Some characteristics are inborn, some are acquired Long ago, 
Spalding made experiments with birds Newly hatched birds were 
enclosed in small boxes which did not allow them to stretch their wings 
or to see other birds fly At the period when usually flying begins, they 
were released and began to fly at once with great skill, showing that 
flying in birds is an inborn function Other experiments were made by 
Scott to find out if the characteristic song of the oriole was inborn or 
acquired When orioles, after being hatched, were kept away from their 
parents, at a given period they began to sing, but the peculiar melody of 
their songs was different from the songs of their parents Thus, singing 
is an inborn characteristic, but the special melody is due to copying 
parents, and so is acquired ^ 

In our human reactions, speech in general is an inborn characteristic, 
but what special language or what special structure of language we 
acquire is due to environment and copying — ^much too often to uncon- 
scious and, therefore, uncritical copying As to the copying of animals 
in our nervous reactions, this is quite a simple problem Self-analysis, 
which IS rather a difficult affair, necessitating a serious and efficient 
‘mentality’, was impossible in the pnmitive stage Copying parents in 
many respects began long before the appearance of man, who has 
naturally continued this practice until the present day The results, 
therefore, are intimately connected with reactions of a pre-human stage, 
transmitted from generation to generation But for our present purpose, 
the most important form of the copying of animals was, and is, the 
copying of the comparative unconditionality of their conditional reflexes, 
or lower order conditionality ; the animalistic identification or confusion 
of orders of abstractions, and the lack of consciousness of abstracting, 
which, while natural, normal, and necessary with animals, becomes a 
source of endless semantic disturbances for humans. More about copying 
will be explained as we proceed 

It should be noticed also that because of the structure of the nervous 
system and the history of its development, the more an organism became 
‘conscious’, the more this copying became a neurological necessity, as 



TERiMINOLOGY AND MEANINGS

exemplified m parrots and apes With man, owing to the lack of con- 
sciousness of abstracting, his copying capacities became also much more 
pronounced and often harmful Even the primitive man and the child 
are 'intelligent' enough to observe and copy, but not informed enough in 
the racial experiences usually called science, which, for him, are non- 
existent, to discriminate between the reactions on the ‘psychological’ 
levels of animals and the t} pical responses %\ Inch man with his more com- 
plex nervous system should have Only an analysis of structure and 
semantic reactions, resulting in consciousness of abstracting, can free 
us from this unconscious cop}'ing of animals, winch, let us repeat, must 
be pathological for man, because it eliminates a most vital regulating 
factor m human nervous and s r, and so vitiates the whole process This 
factor is not simply additive, so that, when it is introduced and super- 
imposed on any response of the human nervous system allowing such 
superimposition, the whole reaction is fundamentally changed in a 
beneficial way 



CHAPTER III 


INTRODUCTION 

And so far as the actual, fundamental, biological structure of our society 
is concerned and notwithstanding its stupendous growth in size and all the 
tinkering to which it has been subjected, we are still in much the same 
infantile stage But if the ants are not despondent because they have failed 
to produce a new social invention or convention in 65 million years, why 
should we be discouraged because some of our institutions and castes have 
not been able to evolve a new idea in the past fifty centuries’ (SS3)

My service at tlie front during the World War and an intimate 
knowledge of life-conditions in Europe and the United States of Amer- 
ica have convinced me that a scientific revision of all our notions about 
ourselves is needed In\ estigation disclosed that all disciplines dealing 
with the affairs of man either do not have a definition of man, or, if they 
do, that it IS formulated in metaphysical, el, subject-predicate languages, 
which are unscientific and ultimately semantically harmful 

As we have, at present, no general science of man embracing all 
his functions, language, mathematics, science and ‘mental’ ills included, 
I believed that to originate such a science would be useful This task 
I began in my Manhood of Humanity, and have continued m the present 
volume The selection of a name for such a science is difficult. The only 
really appropriate name, ‘Anthropology’, is already pre-empted to cover 
a most fundamental and sound discipline, without which even modern 
psychiatry would be impossible This name, at present, is used in a 
lestricfed sense to signify the animalistic natural history of man, dis- 
regarding the fact that the natural history of man must include factors 
non-existent m the animal world, but which are his natural functions,

such as language and its structure, the building of his institutions, laws, 
doctrines, science, mathematics , which condition his environment, his 
s r, which, in their turn, influence and determine his development. 

We see that the ‘natural history’ of animals differs greatly in struc- 
ture from a future scientific 'natural htstoiy’ of man, a structural differ- 
ence very seldom fully realized I propose, then, to call the very valuable 
existing Anthropology the Restricted Anthropology, and to call the 
generalized science of man Genet al Anthropology, so as to include 
all his natural functions, of uhich those coveied by the Restricted An- 
thropology would be a part 

Such a definite General Anthropology would be very different from 
the existing restricted one It would include all disciplines of human 
interest from a special anthropological and semantic point of view. 
Very often an anthropological discipline — for instance, anthropological 
psycho-logics, anthropological sociology, law, history, or ‘philosophy’ — 
would turn out to be a comparaHve discipline Such, by necessity, would 
have to use a language of four-dimensional structure, which would 
necessitate, as a prelimina.y, a fundamental revision of the structure of 
the language they use — u semantic factor which, up to now, has been 
largely neglected. 

It is to be frankly admitted that the present enquiry has led to some 
quite unexpected and startling results In my Manhood of Humamty,] 
I defined man functionally as a time-binder, a definition based on a 
non-el functional observation that the human class of life differs from 
animals in the fact that, in the rough, each generation of humans, at least 
potentially, can start where the former generation left off — a definition 
which, in the language of this particular structure, is sharp, and corre- 
sponds to empirical facts We should notice, also, that in the case of 
primitive tribes which apparently have not progressed at all for many 
thousands of years, \^e always find, among other reasons, some special 
doctrines or creeds, which proclaim very efficiently, often b} killing off 
individuals (who always are responsible for progress in general), thatj 
any progress or departure from ‘time honoured’ habits or prejudices ‘is 
a mortal sin’ or i\hat not Even in our own case we are not free from 
such semantic tendencies Only the other day, historically speaking, the 
‘holy inquisition’ burned or silenced scientists The discovery of the 
microscope a,nd telescope, for instance, ivas delayed for a long time 
because the inventor, in fear of priestly persecution, was afraid to write 
his scientific discoveries in plain language He had to write them in 
cipher — a fact discovered only a few years ago Those afflicted with 
diseases can easily realize where our science in general, and medical

I PRELIM [NARIES 


science in particular, might be today if not for the holy zeal of powerful 
enemies of science who vehementl3' and ruthlessly sponsored ignorance, 
old s r, and so disease 

In some countries, even at present, science is persecuted, and the 
attempt is made to starve scientists, a device often quite as effective as 
burning at the stake, of nhich the Tennessee trial and others are 
examples But, m spite of all these primitive semantic tendencies, which, 
unfortunately, are often very efScient, the general time-binding charac- 
teristic of man remains unaltered, although its rate can be slowed doivn 
by the ignorance of those who control our symbolism — words, money. 

The failure to understand these problems is due to the fundamental 
fact that, until now, we ha\e had no scientific functional von-el defini- 
tion of man , neither have we originated any scientific enquiry into the 
inherent 'nature of man’, w'hich is impossible if we disregard sr We 
should remember that in this commercialized era we offer large incomes 
to those who preach with great zeal how ‘evil’ ‘human nature is’, and 
who tell us how, without their services, all kinds of dreadful things will 
happen to a given indn idual. 

In the light of modern enquiry, the abo>'e issues come to a very 
sharp focus Either these apostles do know that what they promise has 
only delusional value, yet they want to retain their incomes, or else they 
live in delnnoml worlds, and a sane mankind should take care of them 
In cither case, they are wii/if to be any longer entrusted with the care of 
the further development of culture and the future of mankind Sooner 
or later, we must meet this semantic situation squarely, as too many 
factors of human sanity are at stake 

In my Manhood of Humamty, it is shown that the canons of what 
W'C call ‘civilization’ or ‘civilizations’ are based on animalistic generaliza- 
tions taken from the obvious facts of the lives of cows, horses, dogs, 
pigs , and applied to man Of course, such generalizations started with 
insufficient data The generalizations had to be primitive, superficial , and 
when applied in practice, periodical collapses were certain to follow 
No bridge would stand or could even be built, if we iried to apply rules 
of surfaces to volumes The rules or generalizations m the two cases 
are different, and so the results of such primitive semantic confusion 
must be disastrous to all of us 

The present enquiry began with the investigation of the character- 
istic difference between animal and man, namely, the mechanism of 
time-binding This analysis, because of the different struc|:ure of the 
language used, had to be earned on independently and anew The 
results are, in many instances, new, unexpected even by myself, and

they show unmistakably that, to a large extent, even now we nearly all 
copy animals m our nervous processes Investigation further shows that' 
such nervous reactions m man lead to non-survival, pathological states 
of general infantilism, infantile private and public behaviour, infantile 
institutions, infantile ‘civilizations’ founded on strife, fights, brute com- 
petitions , these being supposedly the ‘natural’ expression of ‘human 
nature’, as different commercialists and their assistants, the militarists 
and priests, would have us believe 

As always in human affairs, in contrast to those of animals, the 
issues are circular Our rulers, who rule our symbols, and so rule a 
symbolic class of life, impose their own infantilism on our institutions, 
educational methods, and doctrines This leads to nervous maladjust- 
ment of the incoming generations which, being born into, are forced to 
develop under the un-natural (for man) semantic conditions imposed 
on them In turn, they produce leaders afflicted with the old animalistic 
limitations The vicious circle is completed , it results m a general state 
of human un-sanity, reflected again m our institutions And so it goes, 
on and on 

At first, such a discovery is shocking On second consideration, 
however, it seems natural that the human race, being relatively so recent, 
and having passed through diffeient low levels of development, should 
misunderstand structurally their human status, should misuse their 
nervous system, The present ivork, which began as the ‘Manhood of 
Humanity’ turned out to be the ‘Adulthood of Humanity’, for it dis- 
closes a psychophysiological mechanism of infantilism, and so points 
toward its prevention and to adulthood 

The term ‘infantilism’ is often used in psychiatry No one who has 
had any experience with the ‘mentally’ ill, and studied them, can miss the 
fact that they always exhibit some infantile symptoms It is also known 
that an adult, otherwuse considered ‘normal’, but who exhibits marked 
infantile semantic characteristics, cannot be a fully adjusted individual, 
and usually wrecks his own and other persons’ lives 

In the present investigation, w'e have discovered and formulated a 
definite psychophysiological mechanism wduch is to be found in all cases 
of ‘mental’ ills, infantilism, and the so-called ‘normal’ man The differ- 
ences between such neural disturbances in different individuals turn out 
to vary only m degree, and as they resemble closely the nervous responses 
of animals, which are necessarily regressive for man, we must conclude 
that, generally, we do not use our nervous system properly, and that we 
have not, as yet, entirely emerged from a very primitive semantic stage 
of development, in spite of our technical achievements. 



42 


I PRELIMINARIES 


Indeed, experience shows that the more technically developed a 
nation or race is, the more cruel, ruthless, predatory, and commercial- 
ized Its systems tend to become These tendencies, in turn, colour and 
vitiate international, national, capital-labour, and even family, relations 

Is, then, the application of science at fault ^ No, the real difficulty 
lies in the fact that different primitive, animalistic, un-revised doctrines 
and creeds with corresponding sr have not advanced in an equal ratio 
with the technical achievements When we analyse these creeds semanti- 
cally, we find them to be based on structural assumptions which are false 
to facts, but which are strictly connected with the unrevised structure 
of the primitive language, all of which is the more dangerous because it 
w'orks unconsciously 

When we study comparatively the nervous responses of animals 
and man, the above issues become quite clear, and we discover a definite 
psychoph) siological mechanism which marks this difference That the 
above has not been already formulated in a workable way is obviously 
due to the fact that the structure of the old language successfully pre- 
vented the discovery of these differences, and, indeed, has been largely 
responsible for these human semantic disturbances Similarly, in the 
present .^-system, the language of a new and modern structure, as exem- 
plified by terms such as ‘time-bindmg’, ‘orders of abstractions’, ‘niulti- 
ordinal terms’, ‘semantic reactions’ , led automatically to the disclosure 
of the mechanism, pointing the way toward the means of control of a 
special therapeutic and preventive character. 

The net results are, in the meantime, very promising Investigation 
show's that, in general, the issues raised are mostly hnguisHc, and that, 
in particular, they are based on the analysis of the structure of languages 
in connection with j r All statements, therefore, which are made in this 
work are about empirical facts, language and its structure We deal with 
an obvious and well-known inherent psychophysiological function of the 
human organism, and, therefore, all statements can be readily verified 
or eventually corrected and refined, allowing easy application, and auto- 
matically eliminating primitive mythologies and s r 

After all is done and said, one can only wonder why such a simple 
fact that language represents a very important, unique, and inherent 
psychophysiological function of the human organism has been neglected 
so long 

The answer seems to be that ( 1 ) the daily language is structurally 
extremely complex, (2) it is humanly impossible to analyse its structure 
by using the language of A structure, so that before anything can be 
done at all in this field a yf-system must first be formulated ; (3) there is 



INTRODUCTION 


43 


a general innocence on the part of nearly all specialists, a very few 
mathematicians excepted, of the structural and semantic role of the 
simplest — although still inadequate — A language called mathematics, 
(4) all these issues involve most powerful unconscious factors which 
work automatically against any revision, and (5) the building of a 
/d'system in 1933 is an extremely laborious enterprise, to say the least, 
and, in all probability, really beyond the power of any single man to 
complete 

The last point is quite important , and, although I have no intention 
to apologize or present any alibis, because any thoughtful reader will 
understand it, I must explain, nevertheless, briefly why the present work 
has probably fallen far short of what it e\entually could be 

In the days of Aristotle, we kneiv extremely little of science in the 
1933 sense Aristotle, m his writings, formulated for us a whole scien- 
tific program, which we followed until very lately. Whoever, in 1933, 
attempts to build a ^d-system, must, by internal necessity, connected with 
the problems of the structure of language, do something similar Obvi- 
ously, in 1933, with the overwhelming number of most diversified facts 
known to science, the question is no more to sketch a scientific program 
for the future, but to build a system which, at least in structure, is 
similar to the structure of the known facts from all branches of 
knowledge 

Let me repeat the necessity is internal, and connected with the 
structure of language as such, involving new s r, and so no one can avoid 
It, as this whole work shows m detail 

Now such structural adjustment requires an immense amount of 
study of diverse empirical facts, and then it must depend on new gen- 
eralizations, concerned in the mam with structure Many statements of 
scientists, when even accepted as reliable, still have to be translated into 
a special language in which structural issues are made quite obvious, 
divulging factors in sr This is a very serious difficulty, particularly 
when many branches of knowledge are drawn upon, as each uses its 
own special language, so that such a unitary translation in terms of 
structure imposes a serious burden on the memory of the translator, 
and often little details escape attention m the implications of the transla- 
tion, although they may be well known to the translator. As this is 
probably the chief difficulty, it is in this field that the mam corrections 
will have to be made 

I admit that I started this enquiry without fully realizing its inher- 
ent difficulties, or whither it would eventually lead The more I advanced, 
the more special knowledge was required I had to go to sources, and.

in a way, partially specialize in many branches of science which were 
never connected before The progress was extremely slow , in fact, it 
has taken ten years to write this book, but I had to go through the 
necessary preliminaries or abandon the whole enterprise 

Now I present the results of this work to the public It is the best 
I can do, although I fully realize its limitations and imperfections The 
unexpected drama of such an enterprise is found, in that a /4-system, 
like Its predecessor, involves full-fledged structural metaphysics of some 
sort, to be explained later 

The /4 -system involved primitive structural metaphysics; a /4 -sys- 
tem, to be of any semantic value at all, must start with the structural 
metaphysics or structural assumptions as given by science 1933 The 
first step in building such a system is to study science 1933 and mathe- 
matics, and so to know these structural data (and assumptions where 
we lack data) Such a study is very laborious, slow, and even ungrate- 
ful, because the issues with which ive are concerned are structural 
Thus, years of patient and sometimes painful labour often result merely 
in a very few and brief, but important, sentences 

The active, and only very lately relaxed, persecution of those schol- 
ars who dared to attempt the revision of Aristotle has been very effective 
in keeping the primitive sr There are m this field practically no im- 
portant works of a critical character, and this fact, naturally, made my 
own work more difficult 

It appears that, during the last few years, most of the physiological 
functions of the human organism have been investigated, with the 
exception of psychophysiological semantic reactions and their disturb- 
ances from the present point of view 

The study of aphasia is rather recent, and that of semantic aphasia 
still more so Only since the World War has much new knowledge 
been accumulated in this field With the 1933 scientific outlook, macro- 
scopic structure becomes a function of the sub-microscopic dynamic 
structure, and the considerations of colloidal structure and disturbances 
become extremely important We must, therefore, enlarge the study of 
semantic aphasia as connected with macroscopic lesions, to include 
semantic phasic (not only a-phasic) sub-microscopic functional disturb- 
ances connected with order, natural survival order and its pathological 
reversal, the disturbances of the multiordinal semantic reactions 

It IS known that ‘mental’ ills or difficulties often disturb physio- 
logical functions of the human organism, and vice versa Something 
similar appears to be true about the last and little-mvestigated s r In 
this case, more and special difficulties arise, because of the fact that 



INTRODUCTION 


45 


these particular reactions are strictly connected with different ‘emotional’ 
or affective responses, which aie due to the knowledge (or lack of 
knowledge) of their mechanism They are circular, as all functions con- 
nected with knowledge are This difficulty is very serious and closely 
connected with the structure of language, disclosing also a most impor- 
tant fact, that languages may have structure This subject could not 
have been even suggested by the v4-s>stem, nor could it have been 
analysed by A means 

The most encouraging feature of this work is the fact that it is 
experimental, and that in cases where it has been applied, it worked 
remarkably well It appears that all desirable human characteristics, high 
‘mentality’ included, have a definite psychophysiological mechanism, 
easily understood and easily trained One should not expect this train- 
ing to be more quickly acquired than the mastering of spelling, or driving 
a car, or typewriting Practice shows that it requires approximately as 
much diligence and persistence as learning to spell or to typewrite The 
results accomplished in the field of ‘mental’ health, widened horizons, and 
unlimited possibilities for personal and public adjustment, justify so 
small a price This applies to adults, but m a different way is true for 
children From an educational point of view, it is as simple or as com- 
plex to tram children in the improper use of an important physiological 
function, such as language, as to tram them m the proper use of the 
nervous system and appropriate sr In fact, the new is simpler and 
easier, if we start with it, because it is m accordance with ‘human 
nature’ In theory, it plays a most important role in the prevention of 
many future eventual break-downs, which the old misuse of the func- 
tion was certain to mvohe 

The problems of a ^T-systera aie, to the best of my knowledge, 
novel They are of two kinds (1) scientific, leading to a theoretical,' 
general structural revision of all systems, and (2) puiely practical, such 
as can be grasped and applied by any individual who will spend the time 
and effort necessary to master this system and acquire the correspond- 
ing s r. 

The results are far-reaching They help any individual to solve his 
problems by himself, to his own and others’ satisfaction They also 
build up an affective semantic foundation for personal as well as for 
national and international agreement and adjustment 

Some of the results are quite unexpected For instance, it is shown 
that the older systems, with their linguistic methods of handling our 
nervous system, led inevitably to ‘universal disagreement’ In individual 
life this led to pathological conflicts with ourselves, in private life, to

family strifes and unhappiness, and so to nervous disturbances, in 
national life, to political strifes, revolutions , in international affairs, to 
mutual misunderstanding, suspicion, impossibility to agree, wars. World 
Wars, ‘trade wars’ , ultimately ending m slaughter, general unemploy- 
ment, and an unnecessarily great amount of general unrest, worry, con- 
fusion, and suffering in different degrees for all, helping again to dis- 
turb the proper working of the human nervous system 

The subject of this work is ultimately ‘speaking about speaking’. 
As all human institutions depend upon speaking — even the World War 
could not have been staged without speaking — and as all science is ulti- 
mately verbal, such an analysis must cover a large field. In such an 
attempt, therefore, we must first understand the speaking of scientists, 
of different specialists , and so must get acquainted with their languages, 
and what they are talking about This is the semantic reason why I have 
had to explain to the reader many simple, yet necessary, scientific struc- 
tural issues 

The present book is written on the level of the average intelligent 
reader, and any such reader will get the full benefit for his labour pro- 
vided he IS willing to put into it the necessary work and persistence 
Perhaps a word of warning is necessary My own personal experience 
IS that, when once we have acquired a bad habit, let us say in making 
errors in typewriting, this bad habit is very difficult to eliminate A 
similar remark applies to the old habits of speech, and of the semantic 
responses connected with them A re-education is simple in principle, 
but It requires a great deal of persistent effort to overcome undesirable 
sr My experience convinces me that the self-satisfied, the ‘happy’ 
person, who has no problems at all, if there is such a person, should 
vot attempt to read this book He will waste just so much effort But I 
can confidently promise that any one who has any problems to solve, — 
be they personal difficulties with himself, his family, or his associates — 
the scientist, the teacher, or the professional person who wants to become 
more efficient in his own work, will be amply repaid for spending the 
necessary ‘time’ in mastering the linguistic, and so neurological problems 
involved in such a structuial semantic re-education 

This investigation has turned out to be a general introduction to a 
theory of sanity, the first ever made, as far as I know When applied, it 
genuinely works , but, of course, we have to apply it fully. Mere hp- 
service will not do, because while superficial agreement is quite easy, 
yet physiologically, on a deeper level, we continue to follow the older 
harmful sr In such a case nothing is actually changed , the old neuro- 
logically harmful animalistic responses persist For this the author and

the present work must not be held responsible, the fault will he in the 
disregard of fundamental conditions by the reader or the students 

From an educational point of view, these problems are particularly 
important If teachers disregard the structural linguistic semantic issues, 
they disregard a most powerful and effective educational method If 
they train in structurally and physiologically harmful A habits, after this 
mechanism has been disclosed, such teachers, to my understanding, do 
not honestly perform their very serious social obligations Ignorance is 
no excuse when once we know that ignorance is the only possible excuse. 

The present .Z-system is far from perfect Such a work as this 
has, of necessity, to be altered with the years, as the structure of the 
language used has to be continually adjusted to newly discovered empiri- 
cal structural data But the present enquiry at least shows that in the 
researches in the linguistic and structural semantic fields there are un- 
dreamed-of possibilities of tremendous power, and the circularity of 
human knowledge is made to uork with an increasing acceleration in a 
constructive way toward the adulthood of man 

In Chapter I, I have given a tentative list of some results following 
from the present work Among them we found a new and semantic 
deUmtion of number and mathematics, to be explained in Chapter XVIII. 
This has very far-reaching consequences, because the existing definition 
of number is A, m terms of classes, and makes the importance of mathe- 
matics still more mysterious With the discovery that the only content 
of knowledge is structural, understood as a complex of relations and 
multiordmal and multi-dimensional order, and that the structure of the 
nervous system is such that only in mathematics do we find a language 
of similar structure, the importance of mathematics, considered as a 
language, becomes of fundamental semantic significance for a theory 
of sanity But to show that, and to be able to apply this fact in practice, 
we must clarify or rather eliminate the mystery which surrounds num- 
ber and measurement The semantic definition of number is given in 
terms of relations, and so number and measurement become the most 
potent factors for supplying us with information about structure, which 
we know already gives the only content of knowledge 

At this point, I feel it essential to refer to the unique and astonish- 
ing work of Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West This work is 
a product of such unusual scholarship and breadth of vision that, in 
many instances, the details do not matter Its method, its scope, and 
the complete novelty of its general point of view, combined with such 
tremendous erudition, are of main importance The work is labeled by 
the author as a ‘philosophy of history’, or a morphology of history, or 



48 


I PRELIMINARIES 


morphology of cultures The word ‘morpholog> ’ is used as implying the 
study of forms, and the term ‘form’ appears very frequently through- 
out the book 

The mam contention of this work — and it is an entirely justified 
observation — is that the behaviour of the organisms called humans is 
such that, at different periods, they have produced definite aggregates of 
achiei ements, which we dissect and label ‘science’, ‘mathanatics’, archi- 
tecture’, ‘sculpture’, ‘music’ , and that at any given period all these 
achievements are interconnected by a psycho-logical necessity To this 
statement I would add the structure of languages of a given period 
which affect the j r should not be disregarded 

Spengler is a mathematician, an extremely well and generally in- 
formed mathematician at that, with a great vision He surveys these 
aggregates as definite units and shows the necessary psycho-logical con- 
nections between all the achievements and the evolution of the notion 
of number It does not matter whether all his connections are always 
beyond criticism That some such connections do exist, seems beyond 
doubt All human achie\ements have been accomplished m some definite 
period, and they have been accomplished at a definite period only because 
of the necessary psj cho-logical attitude and jr of that period 

With regard to the method followed m this work of Spengler, we 
must notice, first of all, that the attitude of the work is frankly anthro- 
pological, in the sense of General Anthropology, namely, as the natural 
history of man, not disregarding man’s natural behaviour, such as build- 
ing up sciences, mathematics, arts and institutions, and creating new 
environments, which again influence his development Morphology 
means ‘study of forms’, which carries static implications Taken from 
the dynamic point of view 1933, when we know that the dynamic unit, 
out of w hich the Avorld and ourselves appear to be built, is found in the 
dynamic atom of ‘action’, his ‘form’ becomes four-dimensional dynamic 
structure, the equivalent of ‘function’; and then the whole outlook of 
Spengler becomes a structural enquiry into the world of man, including 
all his activities. 

This ‘form’, or rudimentary structural point of view, or feeling, or 
inclination, or tendency, or sr — call it what you choose — Spengler, the 
mathematician and historian, acquires from the deep study of mathe- 
matics considered as a form of human behaviour, which, in turn, is a 
part of his behaviour \\ hen he was planning and accomplishing his work, 
a natural expression of the strivings of his epoch, which is also our own 
In my own work, I have attempted to formulate these vague strivings of 
our epoch in the form of a general semantic psychophysiological theory

From this point of view, his achievement is momentous, a great 
description of the childhood of humanity In spite of the title, there is 
nothing pessimistic about it, although most of his readers understood it 
in that way ‘The Decline of the West’ implies the birth of a new era, 
perhaps the adulthood of humanity There is no doubt in 1933 that the 
collapses of the older systems which we u itness are probably irrevocable. 
Sir Auckland Geddes, the British Ambassador to the United States 
of America, foresaw them when he said m 1920 ‘In Europe, we know 
that an age is dying Here it would be easy to miss the signs of coming 
changes, but I have little doubt that it will come A realization of the 
aimlessness of life lived to labour and to die, having achieved nothing 
but avoidance of starvation, and the birth of children also doomed to the 
weary treadmill, has seized the minds of millions ’ 

In 1932 Ambassador Mellon, of the United States of America to 
Great Britain, said. 

‘Part of our difficulty arises because we look on the present indus- 
trial economic crisis as merely a sporadic illness of the body politic due to 
conditions m some particular country or section of the world which 
can be cured by applications of some magic formula Greater difficulty 
arises because we who are left over from the last century continue to 
look on the last decade as merely a prolongation of all that is gone 
before We insist upon trying to make life flow in the same channels 
as before the war, whereas in the years since the war ended are, in real- 
ity, the beginning of a new era, not the end of the old ’ 

To this statement of Ambassador Mellon, the newspapers comment 
as follows: 

‘This is an important utterance, since, as far as we know, it is the 
first admission from the ruling forces in this country that the present 
panic is not “just another panic” ’ 

No doubt, a period of human development has ended The only 
sensible way is to look forward to a full understanding of the next 
phase, get hold of this understanding, keep it under conscious and scien- 
tific control, and avoid this time, perhaps for the first time in human 
history, the unnecessary decay, bewilderment, apathy, individual and 
mass suffering in a human hfe-period, animalistically believed, up to 
now, to be unavoidable in the passing of an era Instead of being swept 
down by animalistic resistance to the humanly unavoidable change, we 
must analyse, understand, and so keep conscious control of one change 
to another, and, as yet, always higher state of human culture 

This IS no place to analyse these issues in detail Volumes have 
already been written about the work of Spengler More volumes will

I PRELIMINARIES 


be necessary to analyse the issues raised, and not always solved, in this 
present volume 

I want to make clear only that words are not the things spoken 
about, and that there is no such thing as an object in absolute isolation 
These assertions are negative and experimental and cannot be success- 
fully denied by any one. except by producing positive evidence, which is 
impossible. 

We must realize that structure, and structure alone, is the only link 
between languages and the empirical world Starting with undeniable 
negative premises, we can always translate them into positive terms, but 
such translation has a new and hitherto unprecedented security In the 
era which is passing, positive premises were supposed to be important, 
and \\e did not know that a whole .(d-system can be built on negative 
premises The new era will have to revaluate these data, and build its 
systems on negative premises, which are of much greater security A 
prion, we cannot know if such systems can be built at all, for in this 
field the only possible ‘proof’ is actual performance and the exhibition 
of a sample. 

This has been attempted in my work, and so the possibility of such 
systems becomes a fact on record 

In the new era, the role of mathematics considered as a form of 
human behaviour and as a language will come to the fore Means can 
be found, as exemplified in the present volume, to impart mathematical 
structure to language without any technicalities It is enough to under- 
stand the above-mentioned negative premises and the role of structure, 
and to produce systems from this angle 

The role of mathematics has been and, in general, is still misunder- 
stood, perhaps because of the very unsatisfactory definition of number. 
Even Spengler asserts that ‘If mathematics were a mere science, like 
astronomy or mineralogy, it would be possible to define their object 
This, man is not, and never has been, able to do ’ The facts are that 
mathematicians have been prone to impress us with some religious awe 
of mathematics, meanwhile, by definition, whatever has symbols and 
propositions must be considered a language All mystery vanishes m 
this field, and the only question is as to what kind of language mathe- 
matics represents From the structural point of view, the answer is 
simple and obvious. Mathematics, although in daily life it appears as a 
most insufficient language, seems to be the only language ever produced 
by man, which, structure, ts similar, or the most similar known, to the 
structure of the world and of our nervous system To be more explicit. 



INTRODUCTION 


51 


let me say at once that m this ‘similarity of structure’ we find the only 
positive ‘knowledge’ of 1933, and, perhaps, of any date 

So far, I am in full agreement with the great work of Spengler 
More than that. The Decline of the West may be considered as a pre- 
liminary and preparatory survey of the great cultural spasms which have 
rocked mankind It may be instructive, in the meantime, to point out 
some differences, and the eventual difference of conclusions, between the 
present work and the work of Spengler 

The difference, to start with, is in language Spengler announces his 
work as ‘intuitive and depictive through and through, which seeks to 
present objects and relations illustratively instead of offering an army 
of ranked concepts’ 

My own aim is not merely descriptive, but structural and analytical, 
and so I must use a different language, helping to discover semantic 
psychophysiological mechanisms of the events of which Spengler is giving 
us a very exceptional picture 

Spengler missed two points that mathematics must be considered a 
language , and that the connection which he asserts between the mathe- 
matics of each period and other achievements is more general than he 
suspects and applies to the inherent structure of languages, m general, 
and the j r of each period, in particular 

Although his analysis is in effect A, yet the issues are not formu- 
lated clearly or consciously , nor does he mention that the present-day 
accepted definition of number in terms of classes is still A It is true 
that he considers ‘forms’ and the use of number as relations, but he 
does not emphasize that number has not been formally defined as a rela- 
tion, which IS essential in a ^-system His ‘form’ is still static and not 
dynamic structure , nor did he discover that the only possible content of 
knowledge is structural, a fact which is the semantic factor responsible 
for ‘cultures’, and ‘periods’, and everything else in human development 
This present work is in gieat sjnnpathy with the momentous work 
of Spengler , but, as it culminates in a H-system, it goes further than his, 
and IS more workable and more practical, confirming the general con- 
tention of Spengler, that cultures have their periods of growth and 
development and that, so far, without conscious human intention, they 
are superseded by others. 

We should notice once more in this respect that the issues we deal 
with, whenever human psycho-logical reactions are involved, are circu- 
lar, as distinguished from animal leactions Human structures, in 
language or in stone, reflect the psycho-logical status, feelings, intuitions, 
structural metaphysics, and other j r, of their makers and periods , and. 



52 


I PRELIMINARIES 


vice versa, once these structural stnvings and tendencies are formulated 
as such, they help to quicken and transform one period into the next one. 

To the best of my knowledge, the general analysis of this most fun- 
damental structural semantic problem of human knowledge is here 
formulated for the first time It will allow, as a result, the making of 
human progress conscious , it will enable us to control it and so to make 
it uninterrupted by the painful and wasteful semantic periods of hope- 
lessness and helplessness so characteristic of the older periods of 
transition 

If it is an historical fact and also a ps 3 'cho-logical fact that a time- 
binding class of life has to have periods of development, let us have 
them I Let us investigate the mechanism of time-bmding, of j r, which 
are the dynamic factors of those changes and developments ' Let us direct 
that development consciously, and this will lead to the elimination of 
unnecessary and painful panics, unrest, and the often bloody bursting 
of those animalistic barriers self-imposed on the dynamic class of life 
called 'man’ 

When all is said and done, one cannot but see, at least as far as 
the white race is concerned, that a change from an A to a. .^-system 
must be momentous Such a change will mark the difference between a 
period when the mystery of ‘human knowledge’ was not solved and a 
period when it has been solved This inherent human circular character- 
istic has, so far been neurologically abused We have not known how 
to handle our nervous structure We have imposed upon and hampered 
human development by animalistic methods The solving of the prob- 
lems of the content of ‘human knowledge’ will open a new era of man 
as a man, leading ton ard proper handling of his capacities, and an era 
scientific in all respects, not merely in a few exact sciences. Psycho- 
logically, it will be an era of sanity, and, therefore, of human general 
adjustment, agreement, and co-operation The dreams of Leibnitz will 
become sober reality 

The only determined attempt made, so far, to deal with the sym- 
bolic problems whose importance is emphasized in the present work is 
that of the Orthological Institute (10 King’s Parade, Cambridge, Eng- 
land) This research organization, founded by C K Ogden, editor of 
‘The International Library of Psychology', is concerned with the influ- 
ence of language on ‘thought’ in all its bearings , and it is to be hoped 
that further endowment may be forthcoming to enable the scope of its 
enquiries to be extended to include structure, non-elementalistic semantic 
reactions, and non-aristotelian systems Reference to International Lan- 
guages or a Universal Language will be found in the notes ^ 



PART II 


GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


The relativity theory of physics reduces everything to relations, that is 
to say, it IS structure, not material, which counts The structure cannot 
be built up without material, but the nature of the material is of no im- 
portance (147) A S EDDINGTON 


Structure and function are mutually related Function produces struc- 
ture and structure modifies and determines the character of function (<io) 

. CHARLES M. CHILD 


These difficulties suggest to my mind some such possibility as this that 
every language has, as Mr Wittgenstein says, a structure concerning which, 
tn the language, nothing can be said, but that there may be another language 
dealing with the structure of the first language, and having itself a new 
structure, and that to this hierarchy of languages there may be no limit 
Mr Wittgenstein would of course reply that his whole theory is applicable 
unchanged to the totality of such languages. The only retort would be to 
deny that there is any such totality (456) Bertrand russbll

CHAPTER IV 


ON STRUCTURE 

No satisfactory justification has ever been given for connecting in any 
way the consequences of mathematical reasoning with the physical world. 

(22) E T. BELL 

Any student of science, or of the history of science, can hardly 
miss two very important tendencies which pervade the work of those 
who have accomplished most in this field The first tendency is to base' 
science more and more on experiments , the other is toward greater and 
more critical verbal rigour The one tendency is to devise more and bet- 
ter instruments, and train the experimenters , the other is to invent 
better verbal forms, better forms of representation and of theories, so 
as to present a more coherent account of the experimental facts 

The second tendency has an importance equal to that of the first , 
a number of isolated facts does not produce a science any more than a 
heap of bricks produces a house The isolated facts must be put in 
order and brought into mutual structural relations in the form of some 
theory Then, only, do we have a science, something to start from, to 
analyse, ponder on, criticize, and improve Before this something can 
be criticized and improved, it must first be produced, so the investigator 
who discovers some fact, or who formulates some scientific theory, does 
not often waste his time Even his errors may be useful, because they 
may stimulate other scientists to investigate and improve 

Scientists found long ago that the common language in daily use 
IS of little value in science Thu language gives us a form of representa- 
tion of very old structure in which -n e find it impossible to give a full, 
coherent account of ourselves or of the world around us Each science 
has to build a special terminology adapted to its own special purposes 
This problem of a suitable language is of serious importance Too little 
do we realize what a hindrance a language of antiquated structure is 
Such a language does not help, but actually prevents, correct analysis 
through the semantic habits and structural implications embodied in it 
The last may be of great antiquity and bound up, by necessity, with 
primitive-made structural implications, or, as we say, metaphysics, 
involving primitive s r 

The above explains why the popularization of science is such a 
difficult and, perhaps, even a semantically dangerous problem We at- 
tempt to translate a creative and correct language which has a structure 

55 



56 


II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


similar to the structure of the experimental facts into a language of 
different structure, entirely foreign to the world around us and our- 
selves Although the popularization of science will probably remain an 
impossible task, it remains desirable that the results of science should 
be made accessible to the lajman, if means could be found which do not, 
by necessity, involve misleading accounts It seems that such methods 
are at hand and these involve structural and semantic considerations 

The term ‘structure’ is frequently' used in modern scientific litera- 
ture, but. to the best of my knowledge, only Bertrand Russell and Witt- 
genstein have de\oted serious attention to this problem, and much 
remains to be done These two authors have analy'sed or spoken about 
the structure of propositions, but similar notions can be generalized to 
languages considered as-a-whole To be able to consider the structure 
of one language of a definite structure, we must produce another lan- 
guage of a different structure in which the structure of the first can be 
analysed This procedure seems to be new when actually performed, 
although It has been foreseen by Russell ^ If we produce a /4-system 
based on ‘relations’, ‘order’, ‘structure’ , we shall be able to discuss profit- 
ably the /f-system, which does not allow asymmetrical relations, and so 
cannot be analysed by A means 

The dictionary meaning of ‘structure’ is gn en somewhat as follows • 
Structure Manner in which a building or organism or other complete 
uhole IS constructed, supporting framework or uhole of the essential 
parts of something (the structure of a house, machine, animal, organ, 
poem, sentence, sentence of loose structure, its structure is ingenious, 
ornament should emphasize and not disgijise the lines of structure) , 
The implications of the term ‘structure’ are clear, even from its daily 
sense To have ‘structure’ we must hare a complex of ordered and 
interrelated parts 

‘Structure’ is analysed in Prtncipia Matheinatica and is also simply 
explained in Russell’s more popular works ® The T ractatus of Wittgen- 
stein IS built on structural considerations, although not much is explained 
about structure, for the author apparently assumes the reader’s acquaint- 
ance with the works of Russell ’ 

One of the fundamental functions of ‘mental’ processes is to dis- 
tingpnsh We distinguish objects by certain characteristics, which are 
usually expressed by adjectnes If, by a higher order abstraction, we 
consider individual objects, not in some perfectly fictitious ‘isolation’, 
but as they appear empirically, as members of some aggregate or col- 
lection of objects, we find characteristics which belong to the collection 



ON STRUCTURE 


57 


and not to an ‘isolated’ object Such characteristics as arise from the 
fact that tlie object belongs to a collection are called ‘relations’. 

In such collections, we hate the possibility of ordering the objects, 
and so. for instance, we may discover a relation that one object la ‘be- 
fore’ or ‘after’ the other, or that A is tlie father of B There are many 
■ways in which tve can order a collection, and many relations which we 
can find It is important to notice that ‘order’ and ‘relations’ are, for 
the most part, empirically present and that, therefore, this language 
IS fit to represent the facts as we know them The structure of the actual 
world IS such that it is impossible entirely to isolate an object An A 
subject-predicate language, with its tendencj- to treat objects as in isola- 
tion and to have no place for relations (impossible in coiujilete ‘isola- 
tion’), obviously has a structure not similar to the structuie of the 
world, in which we deal only with collections, of which the members 
are related 

Obviouslj', under such empirical conditions, only a language origi- 
nating in the analysis of collections, and, therefore, a language of ‘rela- 
tions’, ‘order’ , would have a similar structure to the world around us 
From the use of a subject-predicate form of language alone, many of 
our fallacious anti-social and 'indn idiialistic' metaphysics and s r follow, 
which w'e will not analyse here, except to mention that their structural 
implications follow the structure of the language they use 

If W'e carry the analysis a step further, we can find relations 
between relations, as, for instance, the similarity of relations W'^e fol- 
low the definition of Russell Tw'o relations are said to be similar if 
there is a onc-one correspondence between the terms of their fields, 
which is such that, whenever two terms have the relation P, their cor- 
relates hat e the relation O, and tuce versa For example, tw'o senes are 
similar tvhen their terms can be correlated tvithout change of order an 
accurate map is similar to the territory it represents, a book spelt pho- 
netically IS similar to the sounds w hen read , * 

When two relations are similar, we say that they hate a similar 
stincture, which is defined as the class of all relations similar to the 
given relation 

We see that the terms ‘collection’, ‘aggregate’, ‘class’, ‘order’, ‘rela- 
tions’, 'structure' are interconnected, each implying the others If we 
decide to face empirical ‘reality’ boldly, tve must accept the Emstem- 
Minkotvski four-dimensional language, for ‘space’ and ‘time’ cannot be 
separated empirically, and so tve must have a language of similar struc- 
ture and consider the facts of the world as series of interrelated ordered 
events, to which, as abote explained, we must ascribe ‘structure’ Ein-

similar in structure to the empirical facts as revealed hv science 1933 
and common experience. 

The above definitions are not entireli' satisfactori^ for oui purpose. 
To begin with, let us give an ilhistratiom and indicate in what direction 
some reformilation coiiid be made. 

Let us tahe some aaual terntorj' in which cities appear in the fol- 
lowing order Paris. Dresden. Warsaw, when tahen from the West to 
the East. If we were to build a map of this ternton,' and place Paris 
hetiveen Dresden and Warsaw thus: 

Actual temton' * * 

Pans Dresden Warsaw' 

IMap * * 

Dresden Pans ^^'arsaw 

we should say that the map w as w rong, or that it was an incorrect map, 
or that the map has a d-fireni srruciwre from the territory. If. speak- 
ing rough!} , we should try, in our travels, to orient ourselves by such a 
map. we should find it misleading It would lead us astray, and w’e 
might w aste a great deal of unnecessaiy- efiFort In some cases, even, a 
map of w rong structure would bring actual suffenng and disaster, as, 
for instance, in a w'ar, or in the case of an urgent call for a physiaan. 

Two important characteristics of maps should be noticed. A map 
IS not the temtory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure 
to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness If the map could be 
ideall} correct it would include, in a reduced scale, the map of the map ; 
the map of the map, of the map . and so on, endlessly, a fact first noticed 
by Roj'ce 

If we reflect upon our languages, we And that at best they must 
be considered only as maps A word is not the object it represents, and 
languages e.xhibit also this peculiar self-reflexiveness, that we can 
analjse languages by linguistic means. This self-reflexiveness of lan- 
guages introduces serious complexities, w bch can only be solved by the 
theorc of multiordinality gnen in Part VII The disregard of these 
complexities is tragically disastrous in daily life and science 

It has been mentioned already that the known definitions of struc- 
ture are not entirely satisfactory'. The terms ‘relation’, ‘order’, ‘struc- 
ture’ are interconnected by implication .W present, w'e usually consider 
order as a kind of relation. With the new four-diniensional notions 
taken from mathematics and physics, it may be possible to treat relations 
and structure as a form of multi-dimenswnal order Perhaps, theoreti- 
cally, such a change is not so important, but, from a practical, applied,

acteristic of the empirical world which we recognize directly by our 
lo\Yer neiwous centres (. senses’) , and w ith w hich w e can deal a ith great 
accuracy by our higlier nervous centres ('thinking'). This tern seems 
most distinctly of the organism-as-a-whole character, applicable both to 
the activities of the higher, as well as lower, nervous centres, and so 
structurally it must be fundamental

structure of the world, ourselves and our nenous systems included. 
Such antiquated map-language, bj' necessit\, must lead us to semantic 
disasters, as it imposes and reflects its unnatural structure on the struc- 
ture of our doctrines and institutions Obtiously, under such hi.j.'fjrir 
conditions, a saence of man was impossible, differing in structun, from 
our nervous system, such language must also disorganize ihe function- 
ing of the latter and lead us awaj from sanit\'. 

This once understood, we shall see clearly that researches into the 
structure of language and the adjustment of this structure to the struc- 
ture of the world and ourselves, as given bj science at each date, must 
lead to new' languages, new doctrines, institutions . and, m line, may 
result in a new and saner civilization, invoh ing new j r w Inch may be 
called the saentific era. 

The introduction of a few new, and the rejection of some old. 
terms suggests desirable structural changes, and adj'usts the structure of 
the language-map to the known structure of the world, oursehes, and 
the nervous system, and so leads us to new j r and a theory of saniU-

lisasters 

That languages, as such, all have some structure or other is a new

structure, by the very nature of language, reflects in its own structure 
that of the world as assumed by those who evolved the language In 
other words, ue read unconsciously into the world the structure of the 
language we use The guessing and ascribing of a fanciful, mostly 
primitive-assumed, structure to the world is precisely what ‘philosophy’ 
and ‘metaphysics’ do The empirical search for woi Id-structure and the 
building of new languages (theories), of necessary, or similar, structure, 
IS, on the contrary, what science does Any one who will reflect upon 
these structural peculiarities of language cannot miss the semantic point 
that the scientific method uses the only correct language-method It 
develops in the natural order, while metaphysics of every description 
uses the reversed, and ultimately a pathological, order. 

Since Einstein and the newer quantum mechanics, it has become 
increasingly evident that the only content of ‘knowing’ is of a structural 
character , and the present theory attempts a formulation of this fact in 
a generalized way If we build a .^-system by the aid of new terms and 
of methods excluded by the A[-sjstem, and stop some of our primitive 
habits of ‘thought’ and J r, as, for instance, the confusion of order of 
abstractions, reverse the reversed order, and so introduce the natural 
order in our analysis, we shall then find that all human ‘knowing’ ex- 
hibits a structure similar to scientific knowledge, and appears as the 
'knouing’ of structure. But, in order to arrive at these results, we must 
depart completely from the older systems, and must abandon permanently 
the use of the ‘is’ of identity. 

It would seem that the overwhelming importance for maukuid of 
systems based on ‘relations’, ‘order’, ‘structure’ , depends on the fact 
that such terms allow of an exact and ‘logical’ treatment, as twq rela- 
tions of similar structure have all their logical characteristics in com- 
mon It becomes obvious that, as m the /d-system we could not il in 
such terms, higher rationality and adjustment were impossible. Il not 
the human ‘mind’ and its ‘finiteness’ wrhich is to be blamed, but a ni- 

tive language, with a structure foreign to this world, which has w •jht 

havoc with our doctrines and institutions. 

The use of the term ‘structure’ does not represent special dif 'S 
when once we understand its origin and its meanings The ma 
ficulty IS found m the old A habits of speech, which do not all e 
use of structure, as, indeed, this notion has no place in a complelt^.

Let us repeat once more the two crucial negative premises as esta’ 
lished firmly by all human experience (1) Words are not the thin

61 


we are speaking about, and (2) There is no such thing as an object in 
absolute isolation. 

These two most important negative statements cannot be denied 
If any one chooses to deny them, the burden of the proof falls on him 
He has to establish what he affirms, which is obviously impossible. We 
see that it is safe to start with such solid negative premises, translate 
them into positive language, and build a /4-system 
I If words are not things, or maps are not the actual territory, then, 
obviously, the only possible link between the objective world and the 
linguistic world is found in structure, and structure alone The only use- 
fulness of a map or a language depends on the simtlaniy of structure 
between the empirical world and the map-languages If the structure is 
not similar, then the traveller or speaker is led astray, which, in serious 
human life-problems, must become always eminently harmful. If the 
structures are similar, then the empirical world becomes ‘rational’ to a 
potentially rational being, which means no more than that verbal, or 
map-predicted characteristics, which follow up the linguistic or map- 
structure, are applicable to the empirical world. 

In fact, in structure we find the mystery of rationality, adjust-' 
inent , and we find that the whole content of knowledge is exclusively 
structural If we want to be rational and to understand anything at all, 
we must look for structure, relations, and, ultimately, multi-dimensional 
order, all of which was impossible m a broader sense in the /4-system, 
as will be explained later on 

Having come to such important positive results, starting with unde- 
niable negative premises, it is interesting to investigate whether these 
results are always possible, or if there are limitations The second nega- 
tive premise; namely, that there w no such thing as an object m absolute 
isolation, gives us the answer If there is no such thing as an absolutely 
isolated object, then, at least, we have two objects, and we shall always 
discover some relation between them, depending on our interest, ingenu- 
ity, and what not. Obviously, for a man to speak about anything at all, 
always presupposes two objects at least, namely, the object spoken about 
and the speaker, and so a relation between the two is always present 
Even in delusions, illusions, and hallucinations, the situation is not 
changed , because our immediate feelings are also un-speakable and not 
words 

The semantic importance of the above should not be minimized If 
we deal with organisms which possess an inherent activity, such as eat- 
ing, breathing , and if we should attempt to build for them conditions 



62 


II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


where such activity would be impossible or hampered, these imposed con- 
ditions would lead to degeneration or death 

Similarly with ‘rationality’ Once we find in this world at least 
potentially rational organisms, we should not impose on them conditions 
which hamper or prevent the exercise of such an important and inherent 
function The present analysis shows that, under the all-pervading aristo- 
telianism in daily life, asymmetrical relations, and thus structure and 
order, have been impossible, and so we have been linguistically prevented 
from supplying the potentially ‘rational’ being with the means for ration- 
ality This resulted m a semi-human so-called ‘civilization’, based on our 
copying animals in our nervous process, which, by necessity, involves 
us in arrested development or regression, and, in general, disturbances 
of some sort. 

Under such conditions, which, after all, may be considered as firmly 
established, because this investigation is based on undeniable negative 
premises, there is no way out but to carry the analysis through, and to 
build up a y?-system based on negative fundamental premises or the 
denial of the ‘is’ of identity with which rationality will be possible 

Perhaps an illustration will make it clearer, the more that the old 
subject-predicate language rather conceals structure If we take a state- 
ment, ‘This blade of grass is green’, and analyse it only as a statement, 
superficially, we can hardly see how any structure could be implied by 
it This statement may be analysed into substantives, adjectives, verb ; 
yet this would not say much about its structure But if we notice that 
these words can also make a question, ‘Is this blade of grass green ^’, ue 
begin to realize that the order of the words plays an important role in 
some languages connected with the meanings, and so we can immediately 
speak of the structure of the sentence Further analysis would disclose 
that the sentence under consideration has the subject-predicate form or 
structure. 

If we went to the objective, silent, un-speakable level, and analysed 
this objective blade of grass, we should discover various structural char- 
acteristics in the blade , but these are not involved in the statement under 
consideration, and it would be illegitimate to speak about them. How- 
ever, we can carry our analysis in another direction If we carry it far 
enough, we shall discover a very intncate, yet definite, relation or com- 
plex of relations between the objective blade of grass and the observer. 
Rays of light impinge upon the blade, are reflected from it, fall on the 
retina of our eye, and produce within our skins the feeling of ‘green’. , an. 
extremely complex process which has some definite structure.

63 


We see, thus, that any statement referring to anything objective in 
this world can always be analysed into terms of relations and structure, 
and that it involves also definite structural assumptions More than that, 
as the only possible content of knowledge and science is structural, 
whether we like it or not, to know anything we must search for struc- 
ture, or posit some structure. Every statement can also be analysed until 
we come to definite structural issues This applies, however, with cer- 
tainty only to significant statements, and, perhaps, not to the various 
noises which we can make with our mouth with the semblance of words, 
but which are meaningless, as they are not symbols for anything. It 
must be added that in the older systems we did not discriminate between 
words (symbols) and noises (not symbols). In a /I -system such a dis- 
crimination IS essential. 

The structure of the world is, in principle, unknown, and the only 
aim of knowledge and science is to discover this structure The struc- 
ture of languages is potentially known, if we pay attention to it Our 
only possible procedure in advancing our knowledge is to match our 
verbal structures, often called theories, with empirical structures, and see 
if our verbal predictions are fulfilled empirically or not, thus indicating 
that the two structures are either similar or dissimilar. 

We see, thus, that m the investigation of structure we find not 
only means for rationality and for adjustment, and so sanity, but also 
a most important tool for exploring this world and scientific advance 

From the educational point of view, also, the results of such an 
investigation seem to be unusually important, because they are extremely 
simple, automatic in their working, and can be applied universally in 
elementary education As the issue is merely one of linguistic structure, 
it is enough to tram children to abandon the ‘is’ of identity, in the 
habitual use of a few new terms, and to warn them repeatedly against 
the use of some terms of antiquated structure We shall thus eliminate 
the pre-human and primitive semantic factors included in the structure 
of a primitive language The moralizing and combating of primitive- 
made metaphysics is not effectual, but the habitual use of a language 
of modern structure, free from identity, produces semantic results 
where the old failed. Let us repeat again, a most important point, that 
the new desirable semantic results follow as automatically as the old 
undesirable ones followed 

It should be noticed that terms such as ‘collection', ‘fact’, ‘reality’, 
unction’, ‘relation’, ‘order’, ‘structure’, ‘characteristics’, ‘problem’ , 
lUst be considered as multtordinal terms (see Part VII), and so, in gen- 
ral oo-valued and ambiguous. They become specific and one-valued

only in a given context, or when the orders of abstractions are dis- 
tinguished. 

In the following enquiry an attempt to build a science of man, or a 
non-aristotelian system, or a theory of sanity, is made, and it will be 
necessary to introduce a few terms of new structure and to abide by 
them. 

Let me be entirely frank about it the mam issues are found in the 
structure of language, and readers who are interested in this work will 
facilitate their task if they make themselves familiar with these new 
terms and use them habitually. This work will then appear simple, and 
often self-evident. For those other readers who insist on translating 
the new terms with new structural implications into their old habitual 
language, and choose to retain the old terms with old structural impli- 
cations and old sr , this work will not appear simple 

Examples illustrating what has just been said abound, here I shall 
mention only that the E geometries, the new revision of mathematics 
originated by Biouwer and Weyl, the Einstein theory, and the newer 
quantum mechanics , have similar mam aims, namely, to produce 
non-el statements which are structurally closer to the empirical facts 
than the older theories, and to reject those unwarranted structural as- 
sumptions which vitiated the old theories The reader should not be 
surprised to learn that these new theories are not a passing whim of 
scientists, but represent lasting advances in method Whether these 
attempts at restatements are finally found to be valid or not, they remain 
steps m the right direction 

It IS quite natural that with the advance of experimental science 
some generalizations should appear to be established from the facts at 
hand Occasionally, such generalizations, when further analysed, are 
found to contain serious structural, epistemological and methodological 
implications and difficulties In the present work one of these empirical 
generalizations becomes of unusual importance, so important, indeed, 
that Part III of this work is devoted to it Plere, however, it is only 
possible to mention it, and to show some rather unexpected consequences 
which it entails 

That generalization states • that any organism must be treated as-a- 
I whole , m other words, that the organism is not an algebraic sum, a 
linear function of its elements, but ahvays more than that It is seem- 
ingly little realized, at present, that this simple and innocent-looking 
statement involves a full structural revision of our language, because 
that language, of great pre-scientific antiquity, is elementalistic, and stj) 
singularly inadequate to express non-elementalistic notions Such a point

of view involves profound structural, methodological, and semantic 
changes, vaguely anticipated, but never lurinulaleU in a definite theory 
The problems of structure, ‘more’, and ‘non-additivity’ are very important 
and impossible to analyse in the old way 

If this generalization be accepted — and on experimental, structural, 
and epistemological grounds we cannot deny its complete structural justi- 
fication — some odd consequences follow, that is to say, odd, as long as 
we are not accustomed to them For instance, we see that ‘emotion’ and 
‘intellect’ cannot be divided, that this division structurally violates the 
organism-as-a-whole generalization We must, then, choose between the 
two we must either abandon the organism-as-a-whole principle, or 
abandon accepted speculations couched in cl verbal terms which create 
insoluble verbal puzzles. Something similar could be said about the dis- 
tinction of ‘body’ versus ‘soul’, and other verbal splittings which have 
hampered sane advance in the understanding of ourselves, and have filled 
for thousands of years the libraries and tribunes of the world with hol- 
low reverberations. 

The solution of these problems lies in the field of structural, sym- 
bolic, linguistic, and semantic research, as well as in the fields of physics, 
chemistry, biology, psychiatry , because from their very nature these 
problems are structural

. . to be an abstraction does not mean that an entity is nothing It 

merely means that its existence is only one factor of a more concrete ele- 
ment of nature (S73) A N whitehead 

In my opinion the answer to this question is briefly, this — As far as the 
laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as 
they are certain, they do not refer to reality, tisi) A einstein 

Thus it would seem that, -wherever we mfer from perceptions, it is only 
structure that we can validly infer, and structure is what can be expressed 
by mathematical logic, which includes mathematics (4S7) 

BERTRAND RUSSELL 


The current accounts of perception are the stronghold of modern meta- 
physical difficulties They have their origin m the same misunderstanding 
which led to the incubus of the substance-quality categories The Greeks 
looked at a stone, and perceived that it was grey. The Greeks were ig- 
norant of modern phjsics, but modern philosophers discuss perception in 
terms of categories derived from the Greeks (574) a N whitehead 

To the biochemist, biophysicist, biologist, and physiological psychologist, 
however, life and mind are so amazingly complex and comprise so many 
heterogeneous processes that their blanket designation as two emergent 
levels cannot seem very illuminating, and to the observer who contemplates 
the profuse and unabated emergence of idiots, morons, lunatics, criminals, 
and parasites m our midst, Alexander's prospect of the emergence of deity 
is about as imminent as the Greek Imlends (555) 

william MORTON WHEELER 


In speaking of linguistic researches, I do not mean only an anal> sis 
of printed ‘canned chatter’, as Clarence Day would call it, but I mean the 
behaviour, the performance, J r of living Smiths and Brow ns and the 
connections bet-ween the noises uttered by them and their behaviour No 
satisfactory analysis has been made, and the reason seems to be in the 
fact that each existing language really represents a conglomeration of 
different languages with different structures and is, therefore, extremel) 
complex as long as structure is disregarded That ‘linguists’, 'psycholo- 
gists’, ‘logicians’ , were, and usually are, very innocent of mathematics, 
a type of language of the greatest simplicity and perfection, with a clear- 
cut structure, similar to the structure of the world, seems to be re- 
sponsible for this helplessness Without a study of mathematics, the 
adjustment of structure seems impossible 

We should not be surprised to find that mathematics must be 
considered a language By definition, whatever has symbols and proposi- 
tions IS called a language, a form of representation for this something-

going-on which we call the world and which is admittedly vot words 
Several interesting statements can be made about mathematics considered 
as a language First of all, mathematics appears as a form of human 
behaviour, as genuine a human activity as eating or walking, a function 
in which the human nervous system plays a very serious part Second, 
from an empirical point of view a curious question arises : why, of all 
forms of human behaviour, has mathematizing proved to be at each his- 
torical period the most excellent human activity, producing results of 
such enormous importance and unexpected validity as not to be com- 
parable with any other musings of man ? Briefly, it may be said that the 
secret of this importance and the validity of mathematics he in the 
mathematical method and structure, which the mathematizing Smith, 
Brown, and Jones have used — ^we may even say, were forced to use It is 
not necessary to assume that the mathematicians were ‘siipeiior’ men We 
will see later that mathematics is not a very superior actiMty of the 
‘human mind’, but it is perhaps the easiest, or simplest activity, and, 
therefore, it has been possible to produce a structurally perfect product 
of this simple kind 

The understanding and proper evaluation of what has been said 
about the structure and method of mathematics will play a serious seman- 
tic role all through this work, and, therefore, it becomes necessary to 
enlarge upon the subject We shall have to dnidc the abstractions we 
make into two classes’ (1) objective or physical abstractions, which 
include our daily-hfe notions , and (2) mathematical abstractions, at 
present taken from pure mathematics, m a restricted sense, and later 
generalized As an example of a mathematical abstraction, we may take 
a mathematical circle A circle is defined as the locus of all points in a 
plane at equal distance from a point called the centre If we enquire 
whether or not there is such an actual thing as a circle, some readers may 
be surprised to find that a mathematical circle must be considered a pure 
fiction, having nowhere any objective existence In our definition of a 
mathematical circle, all particulars were included, and whatever we may 
find about this mathematical circle later on w ill be strictly dependent on 
this definition, and no new characteristics, not already included in the, 
definition, will ever appear We see, here, that mathematical abstractions 
are characterised by the fact that they hai’C all particulars included. 

If, on the other hand, we draw an objective ‘circle’ on a blackboard 
or on a piece of paper, simple reflection will show that what we have 
drawn is not a mathematical circle, but a ring It has colour, temperature, 
thickness of our chalk or pencil mark , When we draw a ‘circle’, it is no 
longer a mathematical circle with all particulars included in the definition.

but it becomes a physical ring in which nea.' characteristics appear not 
listed m our dehiiition. 

From the above obser\'ations, 'verj' important consequences lollow. 
Mathematizing represents a ven- simple and easy human acti\ ity, because 
it deals with fictitious entities with all particulars included, and we pro- 
ceed by remembering. The structure of mathematics, because of this 
o\ er-simplicity. yet structural similantj- with the external world, makes 
it possible for man to build verbal systems of remarkable validity 

Phi'sical or daih-life abstractions differ considerably from mathe- 
matical abstractions. Let us take any actual object , for instance, what we 
call a penal Now we may describe or ‘define’ a ‘pencil' in as great 
detail as we please, let it is impossible to include all the characteristics 
which we may discoter in this actual objective pencil If the reader will 
trj to git e a ‘complete' description or a ‘perfect' definition of any actual 
physical object, so as to include ‘all’ particulars, he will be convinced 
that this task is humanly impossible These would have to describe, 
not only the numerous rough, macroscopic characteristics, but also the 
microscopic details, the chemical composition and changes, sub-micro- 
scopic characteristics and the endlessly changing relationship of this 
objective something w'hich we have called penal to the rest of the uni- 
verse , an inexhaustible array of characteristics which could never be 
terminated. In general, physical abstractions, including daily-hfe abstrac- 
tions are such that particulars are left out — w e proceed by a process of 
forgetting In other w'ords, no description or ‘definition' will ever include 
all particulars 



Fig.1. 



GENERAL LINGUISTIC 


69 


Only and exclusively m mathematics does deduction, if correct, 
work absolutely, for no particulars are left out which may later be discov- 
ered and force us to modify our deductions 

Not so in abstracting from physical objects Here, particulars are 
left out , we proceed b)' forgetting, our deductions work only relatively, 
and must be revised continuously whenever new particulars are discov- 
ered In mathematics, honever, we build for ourselves a fictitious and 
oversimplified verbal world, with abstractions which have all particulars 
included If we compare mathematics, taken as a language, with our 
daily language, we see readily that in both verbal activities we are build- 
ing for ourselves forms of representation for this somethmg-going-on, 
which IS HOt words 

Considered as a language, mathematics appears as a language of the 
highest perfection, but at its lowest development Perfect, because the 
structure of mathematics makes it possible to be so (all characteristics 
included, and no phj’sical content), and because it is a language of 
relations w'hich are also found in this world At the lowest development, 
because w'e can speak in it as yet about very little and that in a very nar- 
row, restricted field, and with limited aspects 

Our other languages would appear, then, as the other extreme, as 
the highest mathematics, but also at their lowest development — highest 
mathematics, because in them w'e can speak about everything, at their 
low'est development because they are still A and not based on asjmmet- 
rical relations Between the twm languages there exists as yet a large 
unbndged structural gap The bridging of this gap is the problem of the 
workers of the future. Some will w'ork in the direction of inventing new 
mathematical methods and systems, bunging mathematics closer in scope 
and adaptability to ordinary language (for instance, the tensor calculus, 
the theory of groups, the theory of sets the algebra of states and observ- 
ables , ) . Others w ill undertake linguistic researches designed to bring 
ordinary language closer to mathematics (for instance, the present work) 
When the two forms of representation meet on relational grounds, we 
shall probably have a simple language of mathematical structure, and 
mathematics, as such, might then even become obsolete 

It IS not desirable that the reader should be under the impression 
that all mathematical ‘thinking’ is low^-grade ‘thinking’ The mathema- 
ticians who discover or invent new methods for relating and structures 
are the biggest ‘mental’ giants we have had, or ever shall have. Only 
the technical interplay of symbols, to find out some new possible combina- 
tion, can be considered as low-grade ‘thinking’.

From what has now been said, it is probably already obvious that if 
any one wants to work scientifii-ally on problems of such enormous com- 
plexity that they have so far defied analysis, he would be helped enor- 
mously if he would tram his sr m the simplest forms of correct 
‘thinking’ , that is, become acquainted w-ith mathematical methods The 
continued application of this relational method should finally throw some 
light on the greatest complexities, such as life and man In contrast to 
enormous advances in all technical fields, our knowledge of ‘human 
nature’ has advanced very little beyond what primitives knew about them- 
selves We have tried to analyse the most baffling phenomena while dis- 
regarding structural peculiarities of languages and thus failing to provide 
sufflciant fundamental training in new sr In practically all universities 
at present, the mathematical requirements, even for scientists, are 
extremely low, much lower, indeed, than is necessary for the progress of 
these scientists themselves Only those who specialize in mathematics 
receive an advanced training, but, even with them, little attention is 
devoted to method and structure of languages as such Until lately, 
mathematicians themselves were not without responsibility for this. They 
treated mathematics as some kind of ‘eternal verity’, and made a sort of 
religion out of it , forgetting, or not knowing, that these ‘eternal verities’ 
last only so long as the nervous systems of Smiths and Browns are not 
altered Besides, many, even now, disclaim any possible connection 
between mathematics and human affairs Some of them seem, indeed, in 
their religious zeal, to try to make their subjects as difficult, unattractive, 
and mysterious as possible, to overawe the student Fortunately, a strong 
reaction against such an attitude is beginning to take place among the 
members of the younger mathematical generation This is a very hopeful 
sign, as there is little doubt that, without the help of professional mathe- 
maticians who will understand the general importance of structure and 
mathematical methods, we shall not be able to solve our human problems 
in time to prevent quite serious break-downs, since these solutions ulti- 
mately depend on structural and semantic considerations 

The moment we abandon the older theological attitude toward mathe- 
matics, and summon the courage to consider it as a form of human 
behaviour and the expression of generalized sr, some quite interesting 
problems loom up Terms like ‘logic’ or ‘psychology’ are applied in 
many different senses, but, among others, they are used as labels for 
certain disciplines called sciences ‘Logic’ is defined as the ‘science of 
the laws of thought’ Obviously, then, to produce ‘logic’ we should have 
to study all forms of human behaviour connected directly with menta- 
tion , we should have to study not only the mentations in the daily life of 



GENERAL LINGUISTIC 


71 


the average Smiths, Browns . , but we should have to study the menta- 
tions of Joneses and Whites when they use their ‘mind’ at its best; 
namely, when they mathematize, scientize , and we should also have to 
study the mentations of those whom we eall ‘insane’, when they use their 
‘mind’ at its worst It is not our aim to give a detailed list of these forms 
of human behaviour whieh we should study, since all should be studied 
It IS enough for our purpose to emphasize the two mam omissions , 
namely, the study of mathematics and the study of ‘insanity’ 

As a similar reasoning applies to ‘psychology’, we must sadly admit 
that we have as yet no general theory which deserves the name of ‘logic’ 
or psycho-logics. What has passed under the name of ‘logic’, for instance, 
IS not ‘logic’ according to its own definition, but represents a philosoph- 
ical grammar of a primitive-made language, of a structure different from 
the structure of the world, unfit for serious use. If we try to apply the 
rules of the old ‘logic’, we find ourselves blocked by ridiculous impasses 
So, naturally, we discover that we have no use for such a ‘logic’ 

It follows also that any one who has any serious intention of becom- 
ing a ‘logician’ or a psycho-logician must, first of all, be a thorough 
mathematician and must also study ‘insanity’ Only with such prepara- 
tion is there any possibility of becoming a psycho-logician or semantician 
Sometimes it is useful to stop deceiving ourselves; and it is deceiving 
ourselves if we claim to be studying human psycho-logics, or human 
‘logic’, when we are generalizing only from those forms of human 
behaviour which we have m common with the animals and neglect other 
forms, especially the most characteristic forms of human behaviour, such 
as mathematics, science, and ‘insamty’. If, as psycho-logicians, we want 
to be ‘behaviourists’, it is clear that we must study all known forms of 
human behaviour But it seems never to have occurred to the 'behaviour- 
ists’ that mathematics and ‘insanity’ are very characteristic forms of 
human behaviour. 

Some readers may be puzzled by my calling the daily forms of rep- 
resentation we use ‘primitive-made’ Let me illustrate what I mean by a 
classical example For more than two thousand years the famous para- 
dox of Zeno has puzzled ‘philosophers’, without any solution, and only in 
our own day has it been solved by mathematicians The paradox reads 
Achilles was supposed to be a very swift runner, and in a race with a 
tortoise, which was given the benefit of starting first, Achilles could 
never overtake his slow competitor, because, the argument runs, before 
he could overtake the tortoise he would have to halve the distance between 
them, and again halve the remaining half, and so on No matter how 
long this might last, there still would be some distance to halve, and so 



72 


II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


It was concluded he could never pass the tortoise Now any child knows 
that this conclusion is not true , yet the verbal argument for the untrue 
conclusion remained, in the hands of 'philosophers’ and ‘logicians’, per- 
fectly valid for more than two thousand years This instance throws 
light on the stage of development which we have reached and of which 
we often boast 

Having, then, no scientific general theory of 'logic’ and psycho-logics 
to guide us, the task of an enquiry like the present is very much handi- 
capped We must merely go ahead groping and pioneering , and this is 
always a difficult, blundering task 

It is indeed very important that not only the scientists but also the 
intelligent public, as a whole, should understand that at present we have 
no general theory which may be called ‘logic’ or psycho-logics Perhaps 
an illustration will help to bring home this really shocking state of affairs 
Imj^ine, for example, that we should try to study dinosaurs exhaus- 
tively The standard methods of study would centre about the actual 
fossil remains when such are available, but, in the case of those extinct 
forms of which the fossil remains are very meagre, or entirely lacking, 
much information is obtained from the study of the tracks which have 
been left on the mud flats that have become rocks It seems undeniable 
that such a study of fossil tracks would contribute a large share to the 
formulation of any ‘general theory’ of the characteristics of dinosaurs 
We could go further and say that no ‘general theory’ could be complete 
if such study were entirely neglected 

Now, that is precisely the situation in which ‘psychologists’ and 
‘logicians’ find themselves , they have made many studies, and gathered 
some facts, but they have entirely disregarded as yet these unique and 
peculiar black tracks which the mathematicians and others have left on 
white paper when they mathematized or scientized The old ‘psychologi- 
cal’ generalizations were made from insufficient data, in spite of the fact 
that siiffictent data , namely, these black marks on white paper, exist, and 
have existed for a long time But these marks the ‘psychologists’ and 
‘logicians’ were not able properly to read, analyse, and interpret 

Under such circumstances, it should not be surprising to find that, 
in the study of animals, we have vitiated our researches by reading into 
the animals our own activities, and that we have vitiated our owm under- 
standing of ourselves by faulty generalizations from a few data taken 
mostly from those activities which we have in common w’lth animals 
Thus we measure ourselves by ammahstic standards This error is mainly 
due to the ignorance of mathematical method and the disregard of struc- 
tuial problems by those who deal with human affairs. Indeed, as I have 



GENERAL LINGUISTIC 


73 


already shown m my Manhood of Humanity, what we call ‘civilization’ 
rests upon faulty generalizations taken from the lives of cows, horses, 
cats, dogs, pigs , and self-imposed upon Smith and Brown 

The mam thesis of this /^-system is that as yet we all {zuith ex- 
tremely few exceptions) copy animals in our nervous processes, and that 
practically all human difficulties, 'mental' ills of all degrees included, 
have this characteristic as a component. I am glad to be able to report 
that a number of experiments undertaken with ‘mentally’ or nervously 
ill individuals have shown decided benefit m cases where it proved possi- 
ble to re-educate them to appropriate human s r 

Here, perhaps, it may be advisable to interpolate a short explanation 
When we deal with human affairs and man, we sometimes use the term 
‘ought’, which IS very often used arbitraril}', dogmatically, and absolutis- 
tically, and so its use has become discredited In many quarters, this 
term is very unpopular, and, it must be admitted, justly so My use of 
it IS that of the engineer, who undei takes to study a machine entirely 
unknown to him — let us say, a motorcycle He w ould study and analyse 
its structure, and, finally, would give a verdict that with such a structure, 
under certain circumstances, this machine ought to work in a particular 
way 

In the present volume, this engineering attitude is preserved We 
shall investigate the structure of human knowledge, and we shall con- 
clude that with such a structure it should work in this particular way In 
the motorcycle example, the proof of the correctness of the reasoning of 
the engineer Avould be to fill the tank with gasoline and make the motor- 
cycle go In our analogous task, we have to apply the information we get 
and see if it works In the experiments mentioned above, the /^-system 
actually has worked, and so there is some hope that it is correct Further 
investigations will, of course, add to, or modify, the details, but this is 
true of all theories 

Another reason why a non-mathematician cannot study psycho- 
logical phenomena adequately is that mathematics is the only science 
I which has no physical content and, therefore, when we study the per- 
formances of Smiths and Browns when they mathematize, we study the 
only available working of ‘pure mind’. Moreover, mathematics is the 
only language which at present has a structure similar to that of the 
world and the nervous system It must be obvious that from such a 
study we should learn more than by the study of any other ‘mental’ 
activity In some quarters it is believed, I think erroneously, that ‘psy- 
chology’ and ‘logic’ have no ‘physical content’ ‘Psychology’ and ‘logic’ 
have a very definite content — Smith, Brown . , — and we should treat these

disciplines in relation to the living organism Quite probably, when the 
above issues are fully realized, these specialists, future psycho-logicians 
and semanticians, will begin to study mathematical methods and pay 
attention to structure, and a number of mathematicians, m their turn, 
will become psycho-logicians, psychiatrists, semanticians. When this 
happens, we may expect marked advance in these lines of endeavour * 
In the course of this book, it will be shown that the structure of 
human knowledge precludes any serious study of ‘mental’ problems with- 
out a thorough mathematical training We shall take for granted all the 
partial light thrown on man by existing disciplines and shall make some 
observations from the study of the neglected forms of human behaviour, 
such as mathematics, exact sciences, and ‘insanity’, and with these new 
data re-formulate, in the rough, all available data at hand m 1933 

At the present early stage of our enquiry, we must, of necessity, be 
often vague Before we give the new data, it is impossible to speak in a 
more definite way Besides, in such a general survey, we shall have to 
use what I call multiordinal terms At present, all the most humanly 
important and interesting terms are multiordinal, and no one can evade 
the use of such terms Multiordmality is inherent in the structure of 
'human knowledge’ This multiordinal mechanism gives the key to many 
seemingly insoluble contradictions, and explains why we have scarcely 
progressed at all in the solution of many human affairs. 

The mam characteristic of these multiordinal terms is found in that 
they have different meanings in general, depending on the order of 
abstractions Without the level of abstraction being specified, a m o term 
is only ambiguous, its use involves shifting meanings, variables, and 
therefore generates, not propositions, but propositional functions It may 
not be an exaggeration to say that the larger number of human tragedies, 
private, social, racial , are intimately connected with the non-realization 
of this multiordmality of the most important terms we use 

A similar confusion between orders of abstractions is to be found 
in all forms of ‘insanity’, from the mildest, which afflicts practically 

*There are already signs that the more serious workers, as, for instance, the 
Gestalt ‘psychologists’, begin to feel their handicaps Others, as yet, do not seem 
to realize the hopelessness of their endeavours— as best exemplified by the Ameri- 
can school of Behaviourists, who seem to think that the splendid name they have 
selected will solve their problems It would be very interesting to see the Behav- 
iourists deny that the writing of a mathematical treatise, or of some new theory of 
quantum mechanics represents a form of human behaviour which they should study 
Some day they must face the fact that they have neglected to consider a great 
many forms of human behaviour — ^the most characteristic forms at that — and that, 
therefore, they could not produce an adequate theory of the nature of the ‘human 
mind

every one of us, to the most pronounced and violent Indeed, the discov- 
ery of this mechariibin leads conversely to a theory of sanity Imperfect 
as this theory of sanity probably is, it opens a wide field of possibilities 
which I myself, at this stage, am unable fully to appreciate 

There seems one thing certain, at present, namely, that the old 
theories and methods tended strongly to produce morons and ‘insane’ 
persons, while ‘geniuses’ were only born in spite of these handicaps. 
Perhaps in the future we shall be able to produce ‘geniuses’, while 
morons and ‘insane’ persons will be born only in spite of our precautions 
If this should actually prove to be true, and the experimental results 
seem to give some hope in this direction, this world would then become 
quite a different place in which to live.

Philosophers have worried themselves about remote consequences, and 
the inductive formulations of science They should confine attention to 
the rush of immediate transition Their explanations would then be seen 
in their native absurdity. (S78) A N. whitehead 


It is often said experiments must be made without a preconceived idea. 
That is impossible Not only would it make all experiment barren, but that 
would be attempted which could not be done Every one carries in his mind 
his own conception of the world, of which he can not so easily rid himself. 
We must, for instance, use language, and our language is made up only of 
preconceived ideas and can not be otherwise Only these are unconscious 
preconceived ideas, a thousand times more dangerous than the others

The affairs of man are conducted by our own, man-made rules and 
according to man-made theories Man’s achievements rest upon the use 
of symbols For this reason, we must consider ourselves as a symbolic, 
semantic class of life, and those who rule the symbols, rule us Now, 
the term ‘symbol’ applies to a variety of things, words and money 
included A piece of paper, called a dollar or a pound, has very little 
value if the other fellow refuses to take it , so we see that money must 
be considered as a symbol for human agreement, as well as deeds to 
property, stocks, bonds. The reality behind the money-symbol is doc- 
trinal, ‘mental’, and one of the most precious characteristics of mankind 
But it must be used properly , that is, with the proper understanding of

its structure and ways of functioning It constitutes a grave danger 
when misused 

When we say ‘our rulers’, we mean those who are engaged in the 
manipulation of symbols There is no escape from the fact that they do, 
and that they always will, rule mankind, because we constitute a sym- 
bolic class of life, and we cannot cease from being so, except by regress- 
ing to the animal level 

The hope for the future consists in the understanding of this fact; 
namely, that we shall always be ruled by those who rule symbols, which 
will lead to scientific researches m the field of symbolism and sr We 
would then demand that our rulers should be enlightened and carefully 
selected Paradoxical as it may seem, such researches as the present 
work attempts, will ultimately do more for the stabilization of human 
affairs than legions of policemen with machine guns, and bombs, and 
jails, and asylums for the maladjusted , 

A complete list of our rulers is difficult to give , yet, a few classes of 
them are quite obvious. Bankers, priests, lawyers and politicians consti-' 
tute one class and work together They do not produce any values, but 
manipulate values produced by others, and often pass signs for no values 
at all Scientists and teachers also comprise a ruling class They pro- 
duce the mam values mankind has, but, at present, they do not realize 
this They are, in the mam, themselves ruled by the cunning methods] 
of the first class 

In this analysis the ‘philosophers’ have been omitted This is be- 
cause they require a special treatment As an historical fact, many ‘phil- 
osophers’ have played an important and, to be frank, sinister role in 
history At the bottom of any historical trend, we find a certain ‘phil- 
osophy’, a structural implication cleverly formulated by some ‘philoso- 
pher’. The reader of this work will later find that most ‘philosophers’ 
gamble on multiordmal and el terms, which have no dehnite single ( one- 
valued) meaning, and so, by cleverness in twisting, can be made to 
appear to mean anything desired It is now no mystery that some quite 
influential ‘philosophers’ were ‘mentally’ ill Some ‘mentafly’ ill persons 
are tremendously clever in the manipulation of words and can sometimes 
deceive even trained specialists Among the clever concoctions which 
appear in history as ‘philosophic’ systems, we can find flatly opposing 
doctrines. Therefore, it has not been difficult at any period for the rulers 
to select a cleverly constructed doctrine perfectly fitting the ends they 
desired 

One of the main characteristics of such ‘philosophers’ is found in 
the delusion of grandeur, the ‘Jehovah complex’ Their problems have

appeared to them to be above criticism or assistance by other human 
beings, and the correct procedure known only to super-men like them- 
selves So quite naturally they have usually refused to make enquiries. 
They have refused even to be informed about scientific researches car- 
ried on outside the realms of their 'philosophy' Because of this ignor- 
ance, they have, in the main, not even suspected the importance of the 
problems of structure 

In all fairness, it must be said that not all so-called 'philosophy' 
represents an episode of semantic illness, and that a few ‘philosophers' 
really do important work. This applies to the so-called ‘critical phil- 
osophy’ and ro the theory of knowledge or epistemology This class of 
workers I call epistemologists, to avoid the disagreeable implications of 
the term 'philosopher' Unfortunately, epistemological researches are 
most difficult, owing mainly to the lack of scientific psy cho-logic s, general 
semantics, and investigations of structure and sr. We find only a very 
few men doing this work, which, in the mam, is still little known and 
unappl^ It must be granted that their works do not make easy read- 
ing They do not command headlines, nor are they aided and stimu- 
lated by public interest and help / 

It must be emphasized again that as long as we remain humans 
(which means a symbolic class of life), the rulers of symbols will rule 
us, and that no amount of revolution will ever change this But what 
mankind has a right to ask — and the sooner the better — is that our rulers 
should not be so shamelessly ignorant and, therefore, pathological in their 
reactions If a psychiatrical and scientific enquiry were to be made upon 
our rulers, mankind would be appalled at the disclosures 

We have been speaking about 'symbols', but we have not yet dis- 
covered any general theory concerning symbols and symbolism. Usually, 
we take terms lightly and never ‘think’ what kind of implication and j r 
one single important term may involve ‘Symbol’ is one of those impor- 
tant terms, weighty in meanings < If we use the term ‘food’, for instance, 
the presupposition is that we take for granted the existence of living 
beings able to eat , a^, similarly, the term ‘symbol’ implies the existence 
of intelligent beings The solution of the problem of symbolism, there- 
fore, presupposes the solution of the problem of ‘intelli gence’ a nd struc- 
I ture So, we see that the issues are not only senbus and difficult, but, 
_ also, that we must investigate a semantic field m which very little has 
been done. 

In the rough, a symbol is defined as a sign which stands for some- 
thing Any sign is not necessarily a symboK If it stands for something. 
It becomes a symbol for this someth^g If it does not stand for ‘some- 



ON SYMBOLISM 


79 


thing, then it becomes not a. symbol but a meaningless sign This applies 
to words ]ust as it does to bank cheques If one has a zero balance in 
the bank, but still has a cheque-book and issues a cheque, he issues a 
sign but not a symbol, because it does not stand for anything -^The 
penalty for such use of these particular signs as symbols is usually jail- 
ing. This analogy applies to the oral noises we make, which occasion- 
ally become symbols and at other times do not, aS yet, no penalty is 
exacted for such a fraud 

Before a noise“^, may become a symbol, something must exist for 
the symbol to sy mbolize So the first problem of symbolism should be 
to investigate the problem of 'e xistence * To define ‘existence’, we have 
to state the standards by which wk judge existence At present, the use 
of this term is not uniform and is largely a matter of convenience Of 
late, mathematicians have discovered a great deal about this term For 
our present purposes, we may accept two kinds of existence (1) the' 
physical existence, roughly connected with our ‘senses’ and persistence, 
and (2) ‘logical’ existence The new researches in the foundations of 
mathematics, originated by Brouwer and Weyl, seem to lead to a cur- 
tailment of the meaning of ‘logical’ existence in quite a sound direction , 
but we may provisionally accept the most general meaning, as introduced 
by Poincare He defines ‘logical’ existence as a statement free from I 
self-contradictions Thus, we may say that a ‘thought ’ to be a ‘thought’ 
must not be self-contradictnrv A self-contradictory statement is mean- i 
ingless , we can argue either way without reaching any valid results 
We say, then, that a^’self^ontradictory statement has no ‘logical’ exist- 
ence As an example, let us take a statement about a squ are circle This 
IS called a contradiction in terms, a non-sense, a meaningless statement, 
which has no ‘logical’ existence Let us label this ‘word salad’ by a spe- 
cial noise — let us say, ‘blah-blah’ Will such a noise become a word, a 
symbol ^ Obviously not — it stands for nothing , it remains a mere noise , 
no matter if volumes should be wg tten a bom it. 

It IS extremely important, semantically, to notice that not all the 
noises , we humans make should be considered as symbols or valid words 
Such empty noises , can occur not only in direct ‘statements’, but also in 
‘questions’ Quite obviously, ‘questions’ which employ noises , instead 
of words, are not significant questions They ask nothing, and cannot be 
answered. They are, perhaps, best treated by ‘mental’ pathologists as 
symptoms of delusions, illusions, or hallucinations In asylums the 
noises . , patients make are predominantly meaningless, as far as the 
external world is concerned, but become symbols m the illness of the 
patient. 



II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


A complicated and difficult problem is found m connection with 
those symbols which have meaning in one context and have no meaning 
m another context Here we approach the question of the application 
of ‘correct symbolism to facts’ We will not now enlarge upon this sub- 
ject, but will only give, m a different wording, an illustration borrowed 
from Einstein' Let us take anything, for example, a pencil Let us 
assume that this physical object has a temperature of 60 degrees Then 
the ‘question’ may be asked ‘What is the tempierature of an “electron” 
which goes to make up this penaP’ Different people, many scientists 
and mathematicians included, would say: ‘60 degrees’, or any other 
number And, finally, some would say: ‘I do not know’. All these 
answers have one common characteristic, namely, that they are sense- 
less , for they try to answer a meaningless question Even the answer, 
‘I do not know’, does not escape this classification, as there u nothing to 
knoiu about a meaningless question The only correct answer is to ex- 
plain that the ‘question’ has no meaning This is an example of a symbol 
which has no application to an ‘electron’ Temperature by definition is 
the vibration of molecules (atoms are considered as mon-atomic mole- 
cules) , so to have temperature at all, we must have at least two mole- 
cules Thus, when we take one molecule and split it into atoms and 
electrons, the term ‘temperature’ does not apply by definition to an elec- 
tron at all Although the term ‘remperature’ represents a perfectly good 
symbol in one context, it becomes a meaningless noise in another The 
reader should not miss the plausibility of such gambling on words, for 
there is a very real semantic danger in it.' 

In the study of symbolism, it is unwise to disregard the knowledge 
we gather from psychiatry The so-called ‘mentally’ ill have often a very 
obvious and well-known semantic mechanism of projection They pro- 
ject their own feelings, moods, and other structural implications on the 
outside world, and so build up delusions, illusions, and hallucinations, 
believing that what is going on m them is going on outside of them. 
Usually, it is impossible to convince the patient of this error, for his 
whole illness is found in the semantic disturbance which leads to such 
projections 

In daily life we find endless examples of such semantic projections, 
of differing affective intensity, which projections invariably lead to con- 
sequences more or less grave-' The structure of such affective projections 
will be dealt with extensively later on Here we need only point out 
that the problems of ‘existence’ are serious, and that any one who claims 
that something ‘exists’ outside of his skin must show it Otherwise, the 
‘existence’ is found only inside of his skin — a psycho-logical state of

affairs which becomes pathological the moment he projects it on the 
outside world If one should claim that the term ‘unicorn’ is a symbol, 
he must state what this symbol stands for It might be said that ‘uni- 
corn’, as a symbol, stands for a fanciful animal in heraldry, a statement 
which happens to be true In such a sense the term ‘unicorn’ becomes 
a symbol for a fancy, and rightly belongs to psycho-logics, which deals 
with human fancies, but does not belong to zoology, which deals with 
actual animals But if one should believe fiimly and intensely that the 
‘unicorn’ represents an actual animal which has an external existence, 
he would be either mistal<en or ignorant, and could be convinced or. 
enlightened , or, if not, he would be seriously ill We see that in this case, 
as in many others, all depends to what ‘ology’ our semantic impulses 
assign some ‘existence’ If we assign the ‘unicorn’ to psycho-logics, or 
to heraldry, such an assignment is correct, and no semantic harm is 
done , but if we assign a ‘unicorn’ to zoology , that is to say, if we believe 
that a ‘unicorn’ has an objective and not a fictitious existence, this sr 
might be either a mistake, or ignorance, and, in such a case, it could be 
corrected, otherwise, it becomes a semantic illness If, in spite of all 
contrary evidence, or of the lack of all positive eMdence, we hold per- 
sistently to the belief, then the affective components of our s r are so 
strong that they are beyond normal control Usually a person holding 
such affective beliefs is senously^ ill, and, therefore, no amount of evi- 
dence can convince him 

We see, then, that it is not a matter of indifference to what ‘ology’ 
we assign terms, and some assignments may be of a pathological char- 
acter, if they identify psycho-logical entities with the outside world 
Life IS full of such dramatic identifications, and it would be a great ste^ 
forward in semantic hygiene if some ‘ologies’ — eg, demonologies of 
different brands, should be abolished as such, and their subject-matter 
transferred to another ‘ology’ , namely, to psycho-logics, where it belongs^ 

The projection mechanism is one fraught with serious dangers, and 
It IS very dangerous to develop it The danger is greatest in childhood, 
when silly teachings help to develop this semantic mechanism, and so to 
affect, in a pathological way, the physically undeveloped nervous system 
of the human child Here we meet an important fact which will become 
prominent later — ^that ignorance, identification, and pathological delu- 
sions, illusions, and hallucinations, are dangerously akin, and differen- 
tiated only by the ‘emotional’ background or intensity 

An important aspect of the problem of existence can be made clear 
by some examples Let us recall that a noise or written sign, to become 
a symbol, must stand for something Let us imagine that you, my

reader, and myself are engaged in an argument Before us, on the table, 
lies something which we usually call a box of matches you argue that 
there are matches in this box, I say that there are no matches in it 
Our argument can be settled We open the box and look, and both 
become convinced It must be noticed that iii our argument we used 
words, because they stood for something, so when we began to argue, 
the argument could be solved to our mutual satisfaction, since there vi as 
a third factor, the object, which corresponded to the symbol used, and 
this settled the dispute A third factor was present, and agreement be- 
came possible Let us take another example Let us try to settle the 
problem ‘Is blah-blah a case of tra-tra?’ Let us assume that you say 
‘yes’, and that I say ‘no’. Can we reach any agreement? It is a real 
tragedy, of which life is full, that such an argument cannot be solved 
at all We used noises, not words There was no third factor for which 
these noises stood as symbols, and .so we could argue endlessly without 
any possibility of agreement That the noises may have stood for some 
semantic disturbance is quite a different problem, and in such a case a 
psycho-pathologist should be consulted, but arguments should stop The 
reader will have no difficulty in gathering from daily life other examples, 
many of them of highly tragic character 

We see that we can reach, even here, an important conclusion, 
namely, that, first of all, we must distinguish between words, symbols 
which symbolize something, and noises, not symbols, which have no 
meaning (unless with a pathological meaning for the physician) , and, 
second, that if we use words (symbols for something), all disputes can 
be solved sooner or later But, in cases in which we use noises as if they 
were words, such disputes can never be settled Arguments about the 
‘truth’ or ‘falsehood’ of statements containing noises are useless, as the 
terms ‘truth’ or ‘falsehood’ do not apply to them There is one charac- 
teristic about noises which is very hopeful If we use words, symbols, 
not-noises, the problems may be complicated and difficult . we may have 
to wait for a long time for a solution , but we know that a solution will 
be forthcoming In cases where we make noises, and treat them as 
words, and this fact is exposed, then the ‘problems' are correctly recog- 
nized at once as ‘no-problems’, and such solutions remain valid Thus, 
we see that one of the obvious origins of human disagreement lies m the 
use of noises for words, and so, after all, this important root of human 
dissension might be abolished by proper education of j r within a single 
generation Indeed, researches in symbolism and sr hold great possi- 
bilities We should not be surprised that we find meaningless noises in 
the foundation of many old 'philosophies', and that from them arise 



ON SYMBOLISM 


83 


most of the old 'philosophical' fights and arguments. Bitterness and 
tragedies follow, because many ‘problems' become 'no-problems’, and 
the discussion leads nowhere But, as material for psychiatrical studies, 
these old debates may be scientifically considered, to the great benefit of 
our understanding. 

We have already mentioned the analogy between the noises we make 
when these noises do not symbolize anything which exists, and the 
worthless 'cheques’ we give when our bank balance is zero This analogy 
could be enlarged and compared with the sale of gold bricks, or any other 
commercial deal in which we try to make the other fellow accept some- 
thing by a representation which is contrary to fact But we do not realize 
that when we make noises which are not words, because they are not 
symbols, and give them to the other fellow as if they were to be con- 
sidered as words or symbols, we commit a similar kind of action In 
the concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, there is a word, 
'fraud’, the definition of which it will be useful for us to consider Its 
standard definition reads ‘Fraud, n Deceitfulness (rare), criminal de- 
ception, use of false representations (m Law, ) , dishonest artifice or 
trick (pious fraud, deception intended to benefit deceived, and especially 
to strengthen religious belief) , person or thing not fulfilling expectation 
or description ’ * Commercialism has taken good care to prevent one kind 
of symbolic fraud, as in the instances of spurious cheques and selling 
gold bricks or passing counterfeit money. But, as yet, we have not 
become intelligent enough to realize that another most important and 
similar kind of fraud is continually going on So, up to the present, we 
have done nothing about it 

No reflecting reader can deny that the passing off, on an unsus- 
pecting listener, of noises for words, or symbols, must be classified as 
a fraud, or that we pass to the other fellow contagious semantic dis- 
turbances This brief remark shows, at once, what serious ethical and 
social results would follow from investigation of correct symbolism. 

On one side, as we have already seen, and as will become increas- 
ingly evident as we proceed, our sanity is connected with correct sym-] 
holism And, naturally, with the increase of sanity, our ‘moral’ and] 
‘ethical’ standards would rise It seems useless to preach metaphysical 
‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ if we have no standards for sanity. A fundamen- 
tally wn-sound person cannot, in spite of any amount of preaching, be 
either ‘moral’ or ‘ethical’ It is well known that even the most good- 
natured person becomes grouchy or irritable when ill, and his other

II. GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


semantic characteristics change m a similar way. The abuse of symbol- 
ism IS like the abuse of food or drink it makes people ill, and so their 
reactions become deranged. 

But, besides the moral and ethical gams to be obtained from the use 
of correct symbolism, our economic system, which is based on symbolism 
and which, with ignorant commerciahsm ruling, has mostly degenerated 
into an abuse of symbolism (secrecy, conspiracy, advertisements, bluff, 
‘live- wire agents’ , ) , would also gam enormously and become stable Such 
an application of correct symbolism would conserve a tremendous 
amount of nervous energy now wasted in worries, uncertainties , which 
w'e are all the time piling upon ourselves, as if bent upon testing our 
endurance We ought not to wonder that we break down individually 
and socially Indeed, if we do not become more intelligent in this field, 
we shall inevitably break down racially 

The semantic problems of correct symbolism underlie all human 
life Incorrect symbolism, similarly, has also tremendous semantic rami- 
fications and is bound to undermine any possibility of our building a 
structurally human civilization Bridges cannot be built and be expected 
to endure if the cubic masses of their anchorages and abutments are 
built according to formulae applying to surfaces These formulae are 
structurally different, and their confusion with the formulae of volumes 
must lead to disasters Similarly, we cannot apply generalizations taken 
from cows, dogs, and other animals to man, and expect the resultant 
social structures to endure 

Of late, the problems of meaninglessness are beginning to intrigue 
a number of writers, who, however, treat the subject without the realiza- 
tion of the multiordinal, oo-valued, and non-el character of meanings 
They assume that 'meaningless' has or may have a definite general con- 
tent or unique, one-valued ‘meaning’ What has been already said on 
non-el meanings, and the example of the unicorn given above, establish 
a most important semantic issue, namely, that what is 'meaningless’ in 
a given context on one level of analysis, may become full of sinister 
meanings on another level when it becomes a symbol for a semantic dis- 
turbance, This realization, in itself, is a most fundamental semantic 
factor of our reactions, without which the solution of the problems of 
sanity becomes extremely difficult, if at all possible

To what final conclusions are we then led respecting the nature and

The evil produced by the Aristotelian 'primary substance' is exactly

The belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the 
subject-predicate form — in other words, that every fact consists in some 
thing having some quality — has rendered most philosophers incapable of 
giving any account of the world of science and daily life ( is3)

thinks of confirming truth rather than of finding it (82) r d Carmichael

It is necessary here to give a short account of the great scientific 
revolution which started some years ago, but which is still going on 
with very beneficial results This scientific revolution started in geometry, 
and, in a deeper sense, is carried on by geometry Until the work of 
Gauss, Lobatchevski, Bolyai, Riemann , the E geometry, being unique, 
was believed to be the geometry of the 'space*. The moment a second 
geometry was produced, just as good, self-consistent, yet contradictory 
to the old one, the geometry became a geometry None was unique One 
absolute was dead Until Einstein (roughly), the universe of Newton 
was, for us, the universe With Einstein, it became a universe Some- 
thing similar happened to man * A new ‘man’ was produced, just as 
good, certainly contradictory to the old one. The man became a man, 
otherwise a ‘conceptual construction’, one among the infinity of possible 
ones 

It IS not difficult to see that in all these advances there is a common 
characteristic, which can be put simply in that it consists in a little change 
from a ‘the’ into an ‘a’ Some people insist upon sentences in one- 
syllable words, here we could indeed satisfy them* The change, no 
doubt, can be expressed by the exchange of one syllable for another But 
the problems, in spite of this apparent simplicity, are quite important ; 
and the rest of this volume will be devoted to the examination of this 
change and of what it structurally involves 

In mentioning the above names, a very important one was omitted, 
that of Aristotle I merely mentioned these names as representative of 
certain trends Otherwise, of course, it would have been necessary to 
mention additional names, including sometimes those of their predeces- 
sors and the followers who have carried their work further It would 
have been particularly necessary in the case of Aristotle, who was not 
only a most gifted man, but who, also, because of the character of his 
work, has semantically affected perhaps the largest number of people 
ever influenced by a single man , and so his work has undergone a most 
marked elaboration Because of this, his name, in this book, will usually 
stand for the body of doctrines known as aristotelianism It is important 
to keep this in consideration, because it is becoming more and more evi- 
dent that the work of Aristotle and his followers has had an unprece- 
dented influence upon the development of the Aryan race, and so the 
study of aristotelianism may help us to understand ourselves In using 
the name of the founder of the school as a synonym for the school itself,

we make our statements less cumbersome Some of the statements may 
not be true about the founder of the school , yet they remain true about 
the school. 

Aristotle (384-322 b c.) was bom in Stagira, Greece He was the 
son of a physician and had marked predilection for natural history and ai 
distinct dislike for mathematics Rlato, who is considered the ‘father of 
mathematicians', was his teacher Early in his career Aristotle reacted 
strongly against the mathematical philosophy of his teacher, and began 
to build up his own system, which had a strongly biological bias and 
character Psycho-logically, Aristotle was a typical extrovert, who proj ects 
all his internal processes on the outside world and objectifies them : so 
his reaction against Plato, the typical introvert, for whom ‘reality’ was 
all inside, was a natural and rather an inevitable consequence The strug- 
gle between these two giants was tjrpical of the two extreme tendencies 
which we find in practically all of us, as they represent two most diverse, 
and yet fundamental psycho-logical tendencies In 1933 we know that 
either of these extremes in our make-up is undesirable and un-sound, in 
science as well as in life In science, the extreme extroverts have intro- 
duced what might be called gross empiricism, which, as such, is a mere el 
fiction — ^practically a delusion For no ‘facts’ are ever free from ‘doc- 
trines’ so whoever fancies he can free himself from ‘doctrines’, as 
expressed in the structure of the language he uses , simply cherishes a 
delusion, usually with strong affective components The extreme intro- 
verts, on the other hand, originated what might be called the 'idealistic 
philosophies’, which in their turn become el delusions We should not 
overlook the fact that both these tendencies arc el and structurally falla- 
cious Belief in the separate existence of el, and, therefore, fictitious, 
entities must be considered as a structurally un-sound s r and accounts in 
a large degree for many bitter fights in science and life 

In asylums, these two tendencies are sometimes very obvious The 
extreme extrovert is found mostly among the paranoiacs , the extreme 
introvert among cases of schizophrenia (dementia praecox) Between 
the two extremes we find all possible shades and degrees represented in 
daily life as well as m asylums Both extreme tendencies involve harm- 
ful j r, because both produce delusions of some elementalism which, as 
such, IS always fictitious and impossible ‘Mentally’ ill are often charac- 
terized by j r involving this capacity for building for themselves fictitious 
worlds in which they can find refuge from actual life. If we, who live 
outside of asylums, act as if we lived in a fictitious world — ^that is to say, 
if we are consistent with our beliefs — we cannot adjust ourselves to 
actual conditions, and so fall into many avoidable semantic difficulties

But the so-called normal person practically never abides by his beliefs, 
and when his beliefs arc building for him a fictitious world, he saves liis 
neck by not abiding by them A so-called ‘insane’ person acts upon his 
beliefs, and so cannot adjust himself to a world which is quite different 
from his fancy. 

Let me repeat that the nervous system of the human child is not 
physically finished at birth, and, therefore, it is easy to give it quite 
harmful semantic twists, by wrong doctrines To eliminate the vicious 
and fictitious el outlook and s r, it is of paramount importance to try to 
educate a child to be neither an extreme extrovert nor an extreme intro- 
vert, but a balanced extroverted-introvert. 

In psychotherapy, the attempt is often made to re-educate these 
tendencies The physician usually tries to make an extrovert more intro- 
verted, and an introvert more extroverted In case of success, the patient 
either recovers altogether or improves considerably 

In practice there is a considerable difference between the re-education 
of an extrovert to an introvert and that of an introvert to an extrovert 
We have already seen that the balanced person should be both In daily 
el language, the introvert is ‘all thought’ and has not much use for the 
external world, while the extrovert is ‘all senses’ and has little use for 
‘thought’ It often happens that it is easier to re-educate an introvert, 
because at least he ‘thinks’, but difficult to re-educate an extrovert, as he 
has not cultivated his capacity to ‘think’ He may be a remarkable player 
on words, but all his verbal plays, though clever, are shallow. 

Now we shall be able to understand ivhy Aristotle, the extrovert, 
and his doctrines have appealed, and still appeal, to those who can 
‘think’ but feebly The fact that the fuller linguistic system of the extro- 
vert Aristotle was accepted m preference to the work of the introvert, 
Plato, is of serious semantic consequence to us It is evident that man- 
kind, in its evolution, had to pass through a low period of development , 
but this fact IS not the only reason why the A doctrines have had such a 
tremendous influence upon the Arjran race The reason is much more 
deeply rooted and pernicious In his day, over two thousand years ago, 
Aristotle inherited a structurally primitive-made language He, as well as 
the enormous majority of us at present, never realized that what is going 
on outside of our skins is certainly not words. We never ‘think’ about this 
distinction, but we all take over semantically from our parents and asso- 
ciates their habitual forms of representation involving structure as the 
language in which to talk about this world, not knowing, or else forget- 
ting, that a language to be fit to represent this world should at least have 
the structure of this world

Let me illustrate this by a structural example' let us take a man- 
made green leaf We see that in it green colour was added Now let us 
take a natural green leaf We see that the green colour was not added to 
it, but that the natural green leaf must be considered a process, a func- 
tional affair which became green without anybody’s adding green colour. 
In the old savage mythologies, there were always demons in human 
shape, who actually made ever3^hing with their hands This primitive 
mythology built up a ‘plus’ or additive language which attributed to the 
world an anthropomorphic structure This false notion of the world’s 
structure was, in turn, reflected in the language. It was a subject- 
predicate, 'plus’ language, and not as it should be, to fit the structure of 
the world, a functional language 

Here we come across a tremendous fact , namely, that a language, 
any language, has at its bottom certain metaphysics, which ascribe, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, some sort of structure to this world Our old 
mythologies ascribed an anthropomorphic structure to the world, and, 
of course, under such a delusion, the primitives built up a language to 
picture such a world and gave it a subject-predicate form This subject- 
predicate form also was closely related to our ‘senses’, taken in a very el, 
primitive form 

This ‘plus’ tendency not only shaped our language, but even in 
mathematics and in physics we are still much more at home with linear 
(‘plus’) equations Only since Einstein have we begun to work seriously 
at new forms of representation which are no longer expressed by linear 
(or ‘plus’) equations At present, we have serious difficulties m this field 
It must be admitted that linear equations are much simpler than non- 
linear equations I will explain later that the notion of two-valued caus- 
ality IS strictly connected with this linearity or additivity 

Neither Aristotle nor his immediate followers realized or could 
realize what has been said here They took the structure of the primitive- 
made language for granted, and went ahead formulating a philosophical 
grammar of this primitive language, which grammar — to our great 
semantic detriment — they called ‘logic’, defining it as the ‘laws of 
thought’ Because of this formulation in a general theory, we are accus- 
tomed even today to inflict this ‘philosophical grammar’ of primitive 
language upon our children, and so from childhood up imprison them 
unconsciously by the structure of the language and the so-called ‘logic’, 
in an anthropomorphic, structurally primitn e unn erse. 

Investigation shows that three great names in our history have been 
very closely interconnected • Aristotle, who formulated a general theory 
of a primitive language, a kind of ‘philosophical grammar’ of this Ian-

II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


guage, and called it ‘logic' ; Euclid, who built the first nearly autonomous 
‘logical’ system, which we call ‘geometry’, and, finally, Newton, who 
rounded up these structural systems by formulating the foundations of 
macroscopic mechanics These three systems happen to have one under- 
lying structural metaphysics, m spite of the fact that Newton corrected 
some of the most glaring errors of Aristotle Such first systems are 
never structurally satisfactory, and, in time, it was found that these sys- 
tems contained unjustified structural assumptions which their followers 
tried to evade It was natural that the innovators should meet with a 
strong resistance, as these old systems had become so elaborated as to 
impress the ‘thoughtless’ with their finality So the revisions went very 
slowly and very shyly In the case of Aristotle, revision was still more 
difficult because the current religious ‘philosophies’ of the Western world 
were inextricably bound up with the ^-system The religious leaders 
took a strong stand, and as late as the seventeenth century threatened 
death to the critics of Aristotle 

Even today a revision of Aristotle is extremely difficult, for these 
three systems have a tremendous semantic hold upon us Many semantic 
factors have contributed to this hold First, they were established by 
men who were really very gifted Second, they were not wise epigrams 
but were genuine systems with definite structure, and, as such, extremely 
difficult to replace Obviously, it was not enough to pick some weak spot 
in one of these systems , the new system-builder would have to replace 
the old structure by an equally full-fledged structure, and this was a very 
laborious and difficult task Third, these systems were strictly united 
by one structural metaphysics and j r , they collaborated with each other, 
and gave each other assistance Finally, the interdependence of these 
systems rested to a large degree on the structure of the primitive lan- 
guage, upon which Aristotle had legislated, and which was accepted by 
practically all Aryans, and so was inherently bound up with our daily 
habits of speech and sr Together, these four factors constituted a tre- 
mendous power, working against any attempts at revision 

We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an 
habitual language has It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves 
us through the mechanism of j r and that the structure which a language 
exhibits, and impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically projected 
upon the world around us This semantic power is indeed so unbeliev- 
able that I do not know any one, even among well-trained scientists, who, 
after having admitted some argument as correct, does not the next min- 
ute deny or disregard (usually unconsciously) practically every word he

91 


had admitted, being earned away again by the structural implications of 
the old language and his s r 

This linguistic slavery makes criticism very difficult, for the major- 
ity of critics with their j r defend unconsciously structural and linguis- 
tic implications, instead of analysing open-mindedly the structure of the 
facts at hand All our advances are going very slowly, very painfully 
and haltingly, because the new work m science, the Einstein and the 
new quantum theories included, is all of a uoii-el structure, while our 
daily languages are cl and absolutistic and twist pathologically our habits 
of ‘thought’ and j r No help is forthcoming from the so-called ‘psychol- 
ogists’ Not to keep the reader guessing too long, let me say here — 
although this will be explained at length later on — that the mam achieve- 
ment of Einstein was precisely in the fact that he refused to divide 
verbally ‘space’ and ‘time’, which experimentally cannot be so divided 
This was accomplished by the help of the mathematician Minkowski, 
who invented a language of new structure, namely, the four-dimensional 
‘space-time’, in which to talk about events This device made the Einstein 
General Theory possible, and affected the new quantum theories In the 
present work, in order to be able to talk about the organism-as-a-whole, 
we must introduce this non-el principle as fundamental and apply it. 

The first science to break the traditional structural ring was geom-i 
etry Full-fledged E systems were built Following these E systems, 
El systems were built (Einstein, quantum), and the ‘time’ is ripe to build 
a /4-system, which the present writer originated m his Manhood of 
Humanity, and which is formulated as a structural outline of a general 
theory in the present volume 

As soon as this new /4-system was definitely formulated, a most 
curious, natural, and yet unexpected result became apparent , namely, 
that the three new systems, the A, E, and the El have also one under- 
lying structure and metaphysics This fact adds to the importance of 
the situation All these three new systems have been produced inde- 
pendently They express between them the structural and semantic urge 
and longing of all modern science Their mutual interdependence, mutual 
structure, mutual metaphysics, mutual method are helpful, for when the 
vital nature of the issues at hand is clearly seen, it will be found expe- 
dient to start from this interdependence as a basis, although, historically 
speaking, it was not a factor in the production of these systems 

This does not seem to be clearly understood by all scientists. I 
have read, for instance, scientific papers in which Einstein is reproached 
that he did not start with E geometries, but only at a later stage incor- 
porated them into his system This argument, of course, is not against 



92 


II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


Einstein but for Einstein. Similar remarks could be made about this 
present work , and again this would not be an argument against this 
work, but for it All these new systems represent methodological and 
structural advances, and will have played their semantic roles even if 
some day they should be dismissed and systems of different structure 
take their place 

Historically, attempts in the direction oi a. A discipline have been 
very numerous Indeed, the invention of any new important term of a 
non-subject-predicate character, or of a functional character, was, m 
Itself, an attempt m the A direction All sciences have had to abandon 
the common vocabularies and build their own terminologies, many of 
which are also A Although all these attempts have been made, and 
have quite often been successful m their fields, to the best of my knowl- 
edge, the} were not made consciously. The term accepted here , namely, 
‘non-aristotelian’ is very useful, not only because it is appropriate and 
illustrates ver}' well what we have to contend with, but also because it 
places the emphasis properly and makes us conscious of the structural 
issues. The fact that the three new non-systems have as much in common 
as the older three had, recommends and justifies the use of the term 
The new problem which looms up , namely, the validity or non-validity of 
the A law of the excluded third, leads automatically to the non-chrysip- 
pian and A oo-valued ‘logics’, which merge with the theory of probabil- 
ity^ According to the accepted use, it is enough to build a system 
differing from an older system by one single postulate, to justify (for 
instance) the name ‘non-euclidean’ 

The scope of this particular chapter does not permit me to enlarge 
upon this difficult and important problem as to the differences between 
the A and A systems, but for orientation, a short list of structural differ- 
ences is given here , all of which involves new semantic factors 

The primitive form of representation which Aristotle inherited, 
together with its structural implications and his ‘philosophical grammar’, 
which was called ‘logic’, are strictly interconnected, so much so that one 
leads to the other 

In the present .,?-system, I reject Aristotle’s assumed structure, 
usually called ‘metaphysics’ {area 350 bc ), and accept modern science 
(1933) as my ‘metaphysics’ 

I reject the following structurally and semantically important aspects 
of the /d-system, which I shall call postulates, and which underlie the 
/d -system-function : 

1) The postulate of uniqueness of subject-predicate representation 



LINGUISTIC REVISION 


93 


2) The two-valued el ‘logic’, as expressed in the law of ‘excluded 
third’. 

3) The necessary confusion through the lack of discrimination 
between the ‘is’ of identity, which I reject completely, and the ‘is’ of 
predication, the ‘is’ of existence, and the ‘is’ used as an auxiliary verb 

- 4) The elementalism, as exemplified by the assumed sharp division 
of ‘senses’ and ‘mind’, ‘percept’ and ‘concept’, ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’, . 

5) The el theory of ‘meaning’ 

6) The el postulate of two-valued ‘cause-effect’. 

7) The el theory of definitions, which disregards the undefined terms. 

8) The three-dimensional theory of propositions and language 

9) The assumption of the cosmic validity of grammar 

10) The preference for mtensional methods 

11) The additive and el definition of ‘man’. 

This list IS not complete but sufficient for my purpose and for 
orientation 

I reject the use of the ‘is’ of identity entirely, because identity is 
never found in this world, and devise methods to make such a rejection 
possible 

I base the .,?-system-function and system all through on negative 
‘is not’, premises which cannot be denied without the production of 
impossible data, and so accept ‘difference’, ‘differentiation’ , as funda-[ 
mental 

I I accept relations, structure, and order as fundamental 

I I accept the many-valued, more general, structurally more correct 
‘logic of probability’ of Lukasiewicz and Tarski, which m my non-el 
system becomes infinite-valued (oo-valued) semantics * 

I accept functional representation whenever possible 

I introduce the principle of non-elementalism and apply it all 
through, which leads to (a) A non-el theory of meanings; (b) A 
non-el theory of definitions based on undefined terms; (c) A psycho- 
physiological theory of semantic reactions 

I accept the absolute individuality of events on the un-speakable 
objective levels, which necessitates the conclusion that all statements 
f about them are only probable m various degrees, introducing a general 
principle of uncertainty in cUl statements 

I accept ‘logical existence' as fundamental 

I introduce differential and four-dimensional methods 

use the term iofimte-, or m -valued in the sense of Cantor as a variable 

finite. 



94 


II GENERAL ON STRUCTURE 


I accept the propositional function of Russell 

I accept the doctrinal function of Keyser, and generalize the system 
function of Shefler 

I introduce the four-dimensional theory of propositions and lan- 
guage. 

I establish the multiot dmahty of terms 

I introduce and apply psycliophysiological considerations of non-el 
orders of abstractions. 

I expand the two-term ‘cause-effect’ relation into an co-valued 
causality 

I accept the oo-valued determinism of maximum probability instead 
of the less general two-valued one 

I base the .(^-system on extensional methods, which necessitates the 
introduction of a new punctuation indicating the ‘etc ’ in a great many 
statements. 

I define ‘man’ in non-el and functional terms 

This list is also not complete and is given for orientation and 
justification of the name of a non-aristotelian system 

In the rough, all science is developing in the A direction The more 
It succeeds in overcoming the old structural implications of speech, and 
the more successful it is in building new vocabularies, the further and 
more rapidly it will progress 

Our human relations at present are still mostly based on the 
/4-system-function The issues are definite Either we shall have a 
science of man, and, therefore, have to part company with the structural 
implications of our old language and corresponding s r — and this means 
we shall have to build up a new terminology, which is A in structure, and 
use different methods , — or we shall remain in A semantic clutches, use 
A language and methods, involving older s.r, and have no science of man 
As I am engaged in building up a science of man, all departures I am 
forced to make from accepted methods are necessary semantic prelim- 
inaries to the building of my system and need no apology 

It IS no exaggeration to say that the A, E, and N systems have one 
most interesting structural and semantic characteristic in common , 
namely, that they have a few unjustified ‘infinities’ too many The mod- 
ern E, N, and, finally, A systems, after analysis, eliminate these unjusti- 
fied notions New systems arise, quite different from the old ones, which 
again have this structural characteristic in common, that they have a few 
‘infinities’ less — an important semantic factor, especially in the /I-system, 
as it helps to eliminate our older delusional mythologies In the mathe- 
matical reconstruction of Brouwer, Weyl, and the Polish School, a similar

tendency is appaient, leading to revision of the mathematical notions of 
infinit}' For instance, the £-sjsLeni involves several structural ‘infinity’ 
assumptions In it, a line has infinite length , the space constant is infinite , 
and the natural unit of length is also infinite. In the lY-system, the 
velocity of light is assumed unconsciously to be infinite, a structural 
assumption false to facts The /•i-s\stem imolves also false to facts 
infinity assumptions, explained later It is extremely interesting to note 
that in any S3 stem a similar result follows from the introduction of these 
different ‘infinities’ , naineh-, when such an ‘infinity’ is introduced in the 
denominator, it makes the u hole expression lanish ^\’lle^. in the observa- 
tion of actual facts, vie miss some characteristic entirely, for instance, 
order, it leads to the introduction of some ‘infinity’ somevv here In other 
words, faultv', insufficient observation leads to the introduction some- 
where m our systems of some fanciful ‘infinities'. 

I must emphasize again the semantic difficulties which beset us, in 
the formation of a new and .^?-system, mainly because of the lack of 
scientific non-el psv cho-logics and general semantics Having no general 
theories to guide us in our researches, we must select some other devices 
We can survey those achievements of mankind which have proved to 
be the most beneficial and of most lasting v'alue, study their structure 
and try to tram ourselves, and our sr, in repeating the ps} cho-logical 
processes and methods which hav’e made them In this vv'av , vve are led 
to the study of the structure of mathematics and science, and acquire 
the habit of rigorous and critical ‘thought’ and acquire new j r Naturally, 
such a method is wasteful , it would be simpler to have general non-cl 
theories, which I have proposed to call general semantics and ps}’cho- 
logics, replacing the older el ‘logic’ and ‘psychology’, and study these 
short, structurally correct, readv'-made formulations to train our sr 
rather than to studv' the actual performance of scientists and mathema- 
tiaans, and formulate these generalizations for ourselves But, until the 
present vv ork, this could not be done 

For these reasons, we shall hav'e to make, in the following chapters, 
a short survey of different scientific achievements without going into 
technical details, but giving enough of these details to indicate structure 
and Its bearing on r r Ev'er}' thing given will be strictly of an elementary 
character, and the intelligent reader will find no special difficulties in 
following the survey 

The selection of suitable material presented a ver} serious problem

some experience An important factor was the class of readers for whom

and will be— established for the pursuit of this A enquiry , so the future 
student and teacher must have at least an outline of the main problems. 
It seemed nrore advisable to outline mam issues relevant to the subject, 
than to worM out some of them in more detail A great deal of new scien- 
tific literature on structure and s r must be produced by mathematicians, 
psychiatrists, linguists, psycliophysiologists , In this field, experience has 
taughtvfne that very little has been done and that much of what has been 
done/cannot be accepted without a non-el revision It seems to be more 
convenient that the reader shall not be referred to too many books, and 
more expedient that the writer should not take too much for granted , so 
most of the structural and semantic informations which are necessary for 
an intelligent reading are given, togetlier with additional references for 
students who wish to go deeper into the subject 

The reader will find that the non-el principle has been emphasized 
In the meantime, m the writing I have had to use some el terms In 
such cases, I used the old terms in quotation marks The reason for this 
IS that before the full general theory is developed, it is impossible to do 
otherwise. Besides, even if organism-as-a-whole terms were used from 
the beginning, this also would not be entirely adequate , for the organism- 
as-a-whole cannot and should not be structurally separated from its 
environment , and so the terms should be enlarged to cover, by implica- 
tion, the environment 

Later we shall see that all languages have some characteristics simi- 
lar to mathematical languages For instance, the A word, 'apple’, as it 
has no individual subscripts or date, is not a name for a definite object 
or stage of a process which are all different, but a name for a dehmtion, 
which, in principle, is one-valued, while the objective processes are 
co-valued If this mechanism is not clearly understood, we are bound in 
dealing with actual co-valued stages of processes, to identify the co values 
into one or a few values The above considerations necessitate a non-el 
new theory of meanings in accordance with the structure of the world 
and our nervous system 

The distinction between mathematical and physical languages is 
structurally most important, although once identification is entirely elim- 
inated, we discover that all possible characteristics found in this world 
are due to structure, and so can be expressed in terms of structure, rela- 
tions, and multi-dimensional order 

Several similar difficulties will appear later on, all having a similar 
general characteristic , namely, that we seem to reach an impasse, from 
which there is no way out Yet escape can be found, not by solution in 
the old way, but by reformulating the problem so as to make a solution

possible This method is of extreme usefulness m mathematics, and 
seemingly can be applied to life also. 

If we compare the three systems of Aristotle, Euclid, and Newton, 
designated. A, E, N, respectively, in Fig 1, with the non-aristotelian, 
non-euclidean and non-newtonian systems, designated A, E, N, a very 
important fact should be noticed , namely, that 
the AEN trilogy is more general than AEN. 

This fact has far-reaching semantic and prac- 
tical consequences and perhaps can be best 
explained by the aid of a diagram We see 
that the AEN trilogy includes the AEN 
trilogy as a particular case, from which it 
follows that all those readers who are already 
re-educated to the new AEN s r, have less 
difficulty in understanding the older AEN, 
simply because the older systems are only 
particular cases of the new AEN But this is not so with those readers 
who still have tr' old AEN s r , they have to enlarge their limited point 
of view, grasp i lOre than they knew before, and so will have serious 
semantic difficulties for a while, and, perhaps, become impatient or even 
angry With the understanding of this larger generality of the new 
AEN, perhaps a great deal of this semantic futile unpleasantness can 
be eliminated 

I know of no better example to illustrate tbis than to refer the 
reader to a little elementary book. Debate on the Theory of Relativity, 
published by the Open Court Co , Chicago It is really interesting to 
watch how good-natured the einsteinists are as compared with the new- 
tonians This book is suggested because it is elementary, extremely 
instructive, and very well worth reading But the whole literature of 
euclideanism, non-euchdeanism, newtonianism and non-newtonianism 
gives ample proof of the above statements What kind of verbal flowers 
the aristotelians will throw to the non-anstotelians remains to be seen , 
but some verbal and semantic uproar can be expected 

It should be expected that this widening of horizons can only be 
attained, after all, with difficulty, because it requires an alteration of 
habitual reactions, from one-, two-, and three-valued to oo-valued new 
j r — usually not easy to achieve But there seems little doubt that the 
future depends on it, and so we shall not be able to escape it indefinitely. 

As we usually fail to make allowances for the 'emotional’ aspects of 
'intellectual' pursuits, let me once more point to the fact that even purely 
'intellectual’ achievements have their ‘emotional’ components and these

are included in the non-el sr It seems that broader x-\alued under- 
standing has benefidal effect on our^r.a result which should be expected, 
if, as at present, we have no reason to doubt that the organism-as-a- 
whole is a dependable structural non-el generalization. 



PART III 


NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


The history of human thought may be roughly divided into three periods, 
each period has gradually evolved from its predecessor The beginning 
of one period overlaps the other As a base for my classification I shall 
take the relationship between the observer and the observed 

The first period may be called the Greek, or Metaphysical, or Pre- 
Scientific Period In this period the observer was everything, the observed 
did not matter. 

The second period may be called the Classical or Semi-Scientific — still 
reigning in most fields — where the observer was almost nothing and the 
only thing that mattered was the observed This tendency gave rise to 
that which we may call gross empiricism and gross materialism 

The third period may be called the Mathematical, or Scientific Period. 

Irt this period mankind will understand (some understand it already) 
that all that man can know is a joint phenomenon of the observer and the ob- 
served 

Someone may ask. How about “intuitions,” "emotions," etc f The 
answer is simple and positive It is a fallacy of the old schools to divide 
man into parcels, elements, all human faculties consist of an inter-con- 
nected whole , . (38(Q A K 


The organism is inexplicable without environment Every characteristic 
of It has some relation to environmental factors And particularly the 
organism as a whole, i e , the unity and order, the physiological differences, 
relations and harmonies between its parts, are entirely meaningless except 
in relation to an external world (92) CHXRles m child 


In reality it is the brain as a whole which is the centre of association, 
and the association is the very raison d'&tre of the nervous system as a 
whole (411) HENRI PliiRON' 


The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung 
from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength They 
are radical Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, arc doomed to 
fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will 
preserve an independent reality (3S2) H Minkowski 


This assumption is not permissible in atomic physics, the interaction 
between observer and object causes uncontrollable and large changes in 
the system being observed, because of the discontinuous changes charac- 
teristic of atomic processes (2i5) w Heisenberg 

Well, this IS one of the characteristics by which we recognize the facts 
which yield great results They are those which allow of these happy in- 
novations of language The crude fact then is often of no great interest, 
we may point it out many times without having rendered great services 
to science. It takes value only when a wiser thinker perceives the relation 
for which It stands, and symbolizes it by a word (417) H. poiNCARjk

GENERAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL 

The physiological gradient is a case of protoplasmic memory since it 
represents the persistence of the effects of environmental action The 
establishment of a gradient in a protoplasm may be regarded as a process 
of learning. Charles m child 


In what has already been said, we have emphasized repeatedly the 
‘organism-as-a-whole’ principle The principle is structural, involving 
most important semantic factors and so deserves a more detailed con- 
sideration. 

Since the days of Aristotle, more than two thousand years ago, this 
principle has been often emphasized, often belittled, but, witbal, seldom 
applied That all we know about life and organisms seems to justify 
such a principle seems obvious. 

The arguments of those experimentalists who belittle or object to 
such a principle seem to be all of a similar type, and are, perhaps, best 
expressed by Professor H S Jennings, who, m his friendly review of 
Ritter’s book on the Orgmmmal Conception of Life, concludes that 
such an ‘organismal conception’ is quite justified, but is entirely sterile 
and does not help laboratory workers 

It must be granted that at the date when the book of Ritter and 
the review of Jennings were written such a statement was seemingly 
justified. The principle is usually treated as a rough generalization from 
experience and is not analysed further, the structural, epistemological, 
psycho-logical and semantic consequences were not known, and so the 
laboratory workers actually did not realize that they have much help 
As we have already seen, the main semantic issues were, and are, 
structural How can we apply the organism-as-a-whole principle if we 
insist on keeping an el language and attitude ’ Naturally, if the principle 
IS not applied, it is futile to look for semantic consequences of a non- 
applied principle But once the principle is applied, a new language has 
to be built, of different structure and, therefore, new implications, which 
suggest a long senes of new experiments 

A new and structurally different theory may be summarized in a 
single term — as, for instance, ‘tropism’ or ‘dynamic gradient’, a fact 
which not only revolutionizes our knowledge but which leads also to 
entirely new experiments and further knowledge. Experiments, as such,

alwajs give relational, structural data, that, under such and such con- 
ditions, such and such results follow The non-el attitude and language, 
as opposed to the old elementalism, is a part of a broader and more 
fundamental semantic problem, namely, similarity of structure between 
language and the external world Such similarity leads to similarity of 
'logical' relations, predictability, and so forth, and, in general, to the 
understanding of the structure of the -world and neia sr 

There are many examples of such organism-as-a-whole terms, but 
for the present we will mention only the terms ‘tropism’ in the gen- 
eralized sense of Loeb, and the ‘dynamic or physiological gradients’ of 
I Professor Child The term ‘tropism’ means the response of the organ- 
' ism-as-a-whole to special external stimuli For instance, the term ‘helio- 
tropism’ IS applied in cases when the organism responds to the influence 
of light, ‘chemotropism’, when it reacts to chemical stimuli, ‘galvano- 
tropism’, when the organism respondsto galvanic (electrical) stimulation , 
The term ‘dynamic or physiological gradient’ is the foundation of 
the A biological sj'stem of Professor Child Because of its importance, 
I shall explain the meaning of this term in some detail ^ 

All protoplasm exhibits empirically a structural characteristic which 
may be called ‘irritability’, which appears as a reaction of living proto- 
plasm to external dynamic influences That ‘irritability’, as a structural 
characteristic, becomes obvious when we consider that structurally dis- 
integrated protoplasm is colloidally inactive and becomes ‘dead’ Many 
of the most important characteristics of living protoplasm are strictly 
bound up with structural integrity. 

This ‘irritability’ occurs in a structural plenum and is transmitted 
to other regions of the protoplasm with differing yet Unite velocities, 
and not in ‘no time’, as Alice would say. Let us imagine a non-differen- 

tiated, except for the limiting surface 

(A) , and living bit of protoplasm This 
limiting surface represents that part of 
the protoplasm which is in direct con- 
tact with the environment If the ex- 
ternal dynamic factor (S) excites this 
living bit of protoplasm at a point (B), 
this stimulus will be the strongest at 

(B) , and it will spread to the further 
removed portions of (A) in a dimin- 
ishing gradient If the decrement is 
not too sharp, the stimulus will reach 

the furthest regions of (A) , namely, (C), (D), (E), (F), 




GENERAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL 


103 


The presence or absence of the decrement or its steepness and the 
intensity of the excitation during transmission depends on the specific 
character of the protoplasm, and varies from individual to individual, 
and in different regions and under different conditions varies m one 
individual. 

Thus, we see that a living cell has a necessary relationship with the 
environment and with external energies because of its limiting surface 
The difference between the ‘inside of the skin’ and the ‘outside of the 
skin’ establishes the orgamsm-as-a-whole The interplay between the 
inside and the outside is structural and supplies the energies which 
activate the organism The membrane formation is mostly not dependent 
upon the constitution of any particular protoplasm, but is rather a gen- 
eral reaction of all protoplasm to environmental influences 

The evidence we have seems to show that in all protoplasm m which 
we find no specialized conducting paths a certain decrement appears, 
so that the effectiveness of transmission is limited In a primitive non- 
differentiated protoplasm different points further removed from (B) will 
show different degrees of excitatory changes decreasing from (B) At 
a certain point the transmission may cease altogether 

The result, then, becomes an excitation-transmission gradient of 
greater or lesser length, the different levels of which represent various 
degrees or intensities of excitation 

The primary region of excitation (B) is physiologically more affected 
and dominant over the other regions to which the excitation is trans- 
mitted, because it has more effect upon them than they have upon it 
The effect of such conditions gives rise to a temporary structural 
organismal pattern The region of primary excitation (B) becomes the 
dominant region, and the other regions become subordinate to it 

The potentiality for the excitation and the transmission was struc- 
turally present in the protoplasm, but this could not produce the pattern 
which resulted from the external excitation We see that the action of 
the external factor was necessary for the realization of the definite 
physiological pattern whose potentialities were in the protoplasm. 

These new excitation-transmission patterns exhibit all the charac- 
teristics of new structural patterns in the protoplasmic mass They deter- 
mine localized differences at different points, (C), (D), (E) , These 
differences and relations with the dominant region (B) constitute a 
physiological axis with (B) at one pole This new pattern constitutes a 
new structural integration, which is a joint phenomenon of the poten- 
tialities of the protoplasm and the environmental action This relation 
IS of a functional and not merely of a ‘plus’ character. Child shows that 



104 


III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


the physiological axes in their simpler forms are similar to, if not the 
result of, such excitation-transmission gradients 

For the organism to work as-a-whole, some sort of integrating pat- 
tern IS necessary. The behaviour of the organism-as-a-whole results, 
first, from patterns already present, and, second, from the possibilities 
of further development and integration in response to particular external 
factors The phj siological gradients give such means 

The development of our nervous system is strictly connected with 
the above principles discovered by Child ® In axiate animals and man 
the chief aggregation of nervous tissues is localized in the apical (head) 
end, which region is characterized primarily by a higher rate of meta- 
bolism in the early stages Physiological gradients originate as simple 
protoplasmic reactions to external stimuli, and so the nervous system 
onginates in protoplasmic behaviour Nerves then become simply struc- 
turalized and permanent physiological gradients, and so exert a physio- 
logical dominance over other tissues 

From an epistemological point of view, we should notice that the 
gradients are primarily quantitative and that we do not need specific 
factors to determine them Any factor that w ill determine a more or less 
persistent quantitative differential m the protoplasm ought to be effective 
The above theory is structurally supported by a large number of experi- 
ments For instance, we can experimentally obliterate or determine new 
gradients ’ The organism appears m this new light as a behaviour re- 
action-pattern, and substantiates the old saying that the function builds 
the organ Not only should the organism be treated as-a-whole, but it is 
impossible to isolate the organism from its environment A functional 
interrelationship is established bet^\een the two 

This theory appears, also, to be fundamental for psychiatry and 
for psycho-logics, for it establishes the head as a dominant region on the 
liase of an experimentally pro^en higher rate of metabolism From 
Child’s point of view, as suggested by Dr William A White, the mam 
dynamic gradient, the central nen'ous axis, gives the sfnicturalized evi- 
dence of the degree of correlation of the other organs and of the degree 
that the body is under the control of the head-end of this gradient The 
failure to keep m touch iMth this centre of control leads to the disinte- 
gration of the individual^ The head-end is also the most modifiable point 
in the axis of control, a conclusion which is of the utmost significance 
m psychotherapy It is known that the metabolism of organs can be 
affected by ‘psychic’ stimuli, and it is only one step further to under- 
stand, as White says, why we may have other structuralized functions, 
such as structuralized anti-social feelings, structuralized greed, structur-

alized hate . , facts which are observed daily in- ordinary life and in 
asylums From the point of view of the theory of Child, the nervous 
system appears not only as a structurahzed conducting gradient, but it 
also explains how specific conducting tissues could have evolved from 
non-specific living protoplasm It is important to notice the dominance 
which the primary region of excitation exerts over the others, since, with 
the great complexities of the human brain, we understand better why 
so-called ‘mental’ and semantic issues, which are phylogenetically the 
youngest, are of such importance. 

In our daily life we deal with different people, some of whom are 
seriously ill ‘mentally’ and who, under favorable conditions, would be 
under medical attendance The majority of us — some specialists con- 
sider it to run even as high as ninety per cent of the whole population — 
would be better off if taken care of by some psychiatrist, or, at least, 
if under consultation from time to time 

Owing to old religious prejudices, often unconscious, it is still 
believed that those ‘mentally’ ill are either obsessed by ‘demons’ or are 
being punished for some ‘evil’. The majority even of enlightened 
people have a kind of semantic horror or fright at ‘mental’ ills, not 
realizing that under the animalistic conditions which prevail at present 
in our theories, ‘ethical’, social, economic , those only with the least 
human traits are favored, while those most human cannot stand such 
animalistic conditions and often break down It is not a novelty that 
a moron cannot be ‘insane’ A moron lacks something, only the more 
gifted individuals, the more human (as compared with animals), break 
down I know of many psychiatrists iiho say that ‘it takes a "good 
mind’’ to be “insane” ’ 

Now, ‘mental’ and semantic excitation, which phylogenetically ap- 
peared so recently, naturally plays, in many instances, a dominant part, 
a fact which science, until very lately, has completely disregarded The 
present theory makes it quite obvious that with animalistic theories in 
existence, and un-samty (lack of consciousness of abstracting, confusion 
of orders of abstractions resulting from identifications ,) practically 
universally operating m every one of us, a seriously unbalanced race 
must be produced 

There can be no doubt that the consistent application of a non-el 
language m the analysis of animal behaviour has suggested new experi- 
ments and that, as a result, the use of such terms had its influence on 
laboratory w'orkers It does not matter to what extent these terms, or 
the theories which they represented, were ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, they were 
terms of the non-el type, and they expressed m one term entirely struc- 



106 


III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


lurally new and far-reaching theories In testing these theories, new 
series of experiments were required Even when the new experiments 
were devised to verify the older experiments, again the laboratory workers 
got direct benefit of the structurally new terms But these benefits were 
largely unconscious, and so biologists could believe in the older days 
that they had no laboratory benefits from the use of such terms, how- 
ever, this belief is now entirely unjustified 

Since the non-el principle is not only a structurally justified empiri- 
cal generalization, but also involves for its application the structural 
rebuilding of our language and old theories, the semantic issues are far- 
reaching and of great practical value. 

The application of the principle means the rejection of the old 
elementahsm which results and leads to identifications and to blinding 
semantic disturbances, which, in turn, prevent clear vision and unbiased 
creative freedom. 

According to the modern theory of materials, as given in Part X, 
the mutual interdependence, the mutual action and reaction of every- 
thing in this world upon everything else appears as a structural fact 
and a necessity, and so el languages cannot be expected to lead to satis- 
factory semantic solutions We should not be surprised to find that the 
struggle against identification and elementahsm appears at some stage 
in every science. 

Some of the most prominent examples of this tendency outside of 
biology, psychiatry , can be found m modern physics From a structural 
point of view the whole theory of Einstein is nothing else than an 
attempt to reformulate physics on a structuially nezv non-el and A 
foundation — an exact structural parallel of the biological organism-as-a- 
whole principle 

Einstein realized that the empirical structure of 'space’ and ‘time’ 
with which the physicist and the average man deals is such that it can- 
not be empirically divided, and that we actually deal with a blend which 
we have split only elementalistically and verbally into these fictitious 
entities He decided to build a verbal system closer m structure to the 
facts of experience and, with the help of the mathematician Minkowski, 
he formulated a system of new structure which employed a non-el lan- 
guage of space-time As we know from physics and astronomy, this 
non-el language suggested experiments, and so it had beneficial labora- 
tory application But, m fact, the influence goes still deeper, as the pres- 
ent work will show, for such structural advances carry with them 
profound psycho-logical, semantic effects Although, at present, these 



GENERAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL 


107 


beneficial influences operate unconsciously, they, nevertheless, tend to 
counteract the el and absolutistic semantic effects of identification. 

It IS interesting to note that the Einstein theory, because struc- 
tural, has had the effect upon the younger physicists of a semantic 
release from the old structural elementalism and has prepared the seman- 
tic ground for the crop of young geniuses which has sprung up lately in 
the quantum field It was found that the el ‘absolute’ division of the 
‘observer’ and the ‘observed’ was false to facts, because every observa- 
tion m this field disturbs the observed. The elimination of this elemen- 
talism m the quantum field led to the most revolutionary restricted 
‘uncertainty principle’ of Heisenberg, which, without abolishing deter- 
minism, requires the transforming of the two-valued A ‘logic’ into the 
00 -valued semantics of probability Again, this advance in quantum 
formulations has suggested new experiments 

The .(4-system, as originated by the writer in his Manhood of 
Humanity and other writings, is also the result of the structurally non-el 
tendency In Manhood of Humanity, I introduced a non-el term, ‘time- 
binding’, by which is meant all the factors ivhich as-a-ivhole make man 
a man, and which differentiate him from animals In carrying the sys- 
tem further m the present book, I reject the structurally el separation 
involved in such terms as ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ , and introduce, instead, 
non-el terms, such as ‘different orders of abstractions’ , where ‘mind’ 
and ‘senses’ , are no longer divided Curiously enough, even in such a 
field, the method has suggested experiments, and so again the new 
language has laboratory importance 

What has been said above about the organism-as-a-whole, and illus- 
trated by particular cases, seems to show a general characteristic of all 
our abstracting capacities We usually disregard, or fail to appreciate, 
the fact that a single structurally important new term might lead to 
the re-postulation of the whole structure of the language in the given 
field In science we search for structure, so any structurally new term 
IS useful, because, when tested, it always gives structural information, 
whether positive or negative In our human affairs, it is different All 
our human institutions follow the structure of the language used, but 
we never ‘think’ of that, and, when the silly institutions do not work, 
we blame it all on ‘human nature’, without any scientific justification 
Poincare, m one of his essays, speaks about the harmful effect which 
the term ‘heat’ had on physics Grammatically, the term ‘heat’ is classi- 
fied as a substantive, and so physics was labouring for centuries looking 
for some ‘substance’ which would correspond to the substantive name 
‘heat’ We know by now that there is no such thing, but that ‘heat’ must 



108 


III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


be considered as a manifestation of ‘energy’. If we choose to carry this 
analysis further, we should find that ‘energy’ is also not a very satis- 
factory term, but that ‘action’, perhaps, is more fundamental 

In dealing with ourselves and the world around us, we must take 
into account the structural fact that everything m this world is strictly 
interrelated with everything else, and so we must make efforts to dis- 
card primitive el terms, which imply structurally a non-existing isolation 
The moment this is realized, we shall have to treat the non-el prin- 
ciple seriously As the new terms have, also, their non-el implications, 
such terms throw new light on old problems 

In practice, it is difficult, at first, to avoid the use of old terms 
When we want to digest fully a new and important work based on new 
structural terms and acquire corresponding sr, the best way to train 
oneself in the use of the new terms is by gradually dropping the old 
terms If we have to use the old terms, then we should tram ourselves 
to be aware of their insufficiency and of their fallacious structural im- 
plications, and so be free from the old sr 

The use of the new terms should be deliberate We should put the 
problem to ourselves somewhat as follows The old language is struc- 
turally, and, therefore, by implication, semantically unsatisfactory, the 
new terms seem to correspond closer to facts , let us test the new terms 
Are the new terms always structurally satisfactory ^ Probably not, but 
in science experiments check predictions, and so new structural issues 
become clarified 

We have been speaking about new and old terms quite simply, yet 
the issues are not so simple The invention of a single structurally new 
term always involves new structural and relational notions, which, again, 
involve s r For instance, if we study any event, and in that study use 
the terms ‘tropism’, or ‘dynamic gradient’, or ‘time-bmdmg’, or ‘order 
of abstractions’, or ‘space-time’, or ‘wave-packets’ , we must use all 
structural and semantic implications the terms involve 

Using the first four terms, we are bound to treat the organism-as-a- 
whole, for the terms are not el They are not based on the notion of, nor 
do they postulate, some fictitious ‘isolated’ elements In using space-time, 
we introduce the individuality of events, as every ‘point of space’ carries 
with itself a date, which, by necessity, makes every ‘point’ in space-time 
unique and individual In using the term ‘wave-packet’, we re-mterpret 
the older objectified and, perhaps, fictitious ‘electron’, 

The consistent and permanent use of such terms naturally involves, 
structurally, a new world-outlook, new sr, more justified by our scien- 
tific and daily experience But the greatest gam is usually in getting 



GENERAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL 


109 


away from primitive structural notions and metaphysics, with their 
VICIOUS semantic disturbances In creative work, semantic limitations 
hamper a clear understanding, and prevent scientists from inventing or 
formulating better, simpler, and more effective theories of different 
structure 

As soon as we possess ‘knowledge’, then we shall ‘know’ all that 
there is to be known By definition, there cannot be any unknowable 
There is a place for the unknown structure The unknown is rather 
extensive, partly because science has been, and still is, persecuted, as 
has already been pointed out 

The so-called ‘unknowable’ was the semantic result of identifica- 
tion, of a semantic unbalance, which posits for knowledge something 
‘beyond’ knowledge But has such a postulation any meanings outside 
of psychopathology ? Of course not, as it starts with a self-contradictory 
assumption, which, being senseless, must lead to senseless results 

We have dwelt on the problems of the structure of terms at such 
length, because they are generally disregarded, but they are, for semantic 
purposes, fundamental The reader will get the mam benefit of this book 
and will receive help in understanding modern scientific issues if he be- 
comes entirely convinced of the seriousness of structural and semantic 
problems 

Terms are artifices of humans which are necessary to economize 
effort in the field of ‘experience’ and experimentation They are useful in 
reducing the actual amount of experience necessary, by allowing verbal 
, experimentation The human rate of progress is swifter than that of 
the animals, and this is due mainly to the fact that we can summarize 
and transmit past experiences to the young generation m a degree far 
more effective than that of the animals We have also extra-neural 
means for recording experiences, which the animals lack entirely 

That such verbal experimentation is possible at all is conditioned 
by the fact that languages have structure, and that our knowledge of the 
world IS structural knowledge Let us repeat once more that if two rela- 
tions have similar structure, all of their ‘logical’ characteristics are simi- 
lar; therefore, once structure is discovered, such a process of verbal 
experimentation becomes extremely effective, and an accelerating cultural 
device The use of an antiquated language m our human affairs, m 
addition to other drawbacks, prevents our being more intelligent in 
those affairs 

The natural order of investigation is indicated thus ( 1 ) Empirical 
search for structure in the sciences, (2) Once this structure is dis- 
covered, at each date, the structure of our language is adjusted to it and

III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


our new j r trained Historically, we have partially followed the reversed, 
and ultimately pre-human, and so pathological, order Without science, 
and with extremely meagre and primitive knowledge of the structure of 
the world, we have produced grunts and languages of primitive false 
structure, reflecting, of necessity, its implications as to the assumed 
structure of the world We have made out of it primitive dogmas which 
are still in full sway and embodied m the structure of the old language 
This IS also the reason why, outside of technical achievements, we are 
still on such primitive levels It is eas}^ to understand why experimental 
science is of such importance and why theoretical (verbal) predictions 
must be tested experimentally The above also gives a deeper and a new 
justification for what is called 'pragmatism’ 

Experiments constitute a search for relations and structure m the 
empirical world Theories produce languages of some structure If the 
two structures are similar, the ‘theories work’ , otherwise, they do not, 
and suggest further search and structural adjustments 

It should be mentioned, perhaps, that the mam epistemological 
principle which has led to the writing of the works of the present author 
was a definite inclination to abandon identification and the resulting 
structurally unsatisfactory el language in general use, and to produce a 
non-el system, which, in structure, would be similar to the world around 
us, ourselves and our nervous system included This structural novelty 
was the foundation on which the /4-system has been gradually built 



CHAPTER IX p 
COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR 


In fact, to-day colloids may be regarded as an important, perhaps the 
most important connecting link between the organic and the inorganic 

world (7) WOLFGANG PAULI 


In our researches, let us follow the natural order and give a brief 
structural account of what we know, empirically, about the medium m 
which life IS found, namely, about the colloids The following few 
elementary particulars show the empirical importance of structure, and so 
are fundamental in the present work 

At present, physicians are usually too innocent of psychiatry, and 
psychiatrists, although they often complain about this innocence of their 
colleagues, seldom, if ever, themselves pay any attention to the colloidal 
structure of life, and their arguments about the ‘body-mind’ problem 
are still scientifically incomplete and unconvincing, though the ‘body- 
mind’ problem has been present with us for thousands of years It is a 
very important semantic problem, and, as yet, not solved scientifically, 
although there is a simple solution of it to be found in the colloidal 
stiucture of life 

The reader should not ascribe any uniqueness of the ‘cause-effect’ 
character to the statements which follow, as they may not be true when 
generalized Colloidal science is young and little known Science has 
accumulated a maze of facts, but we do not have, as yet, a general theory 
of colloidal behaviour. Statements, therefore, should not be unduly 
generalized 

We shall only indicate a few structural and relational connections 
important for our purpose. 

When we take a piece of some material and subdivide it into 
smaller pieces, we cannot carry on this process indefinitely At some 
stage of this process the bits become so small that they cannot be seen 
with the most powerful microscope At a further stage, we should 
reach a limit of the subdivision that the particles can undergo without 
losing their chemical character Such a limit is called the molecule * The 
smallest particle visible in the microscope is still about one thousand 
times larger than the largest molecule So we see that between the 
molecule and the smallest visible particle there is a wide range of sizes 

♦This statement is only approximate, because there is evidence that chemical 
characteristics change as the molecule is approached 

111 



112 III. NON-ELEilENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 

Findlay calls these the ‘twilight zone of matter’, and it was Oswald, I 
believe, ivho called it the 'world of neglected dimensions’. 

This ‘world of neglected dimensions' is of particular interest to us, 
because in this range of subdmsion or smallness we find verj peculiar 
forms of behaviour — ^lif e included — ^which are called 'colloidal behaviour’ 
The term ‘colloid’ ivas proposed in 1861 by Thomas Graham to 
describe the distinction between the behaviour of those materials which 
readily crj-stallize and diffuse through animal membranes and those 
which form ‘amorphous’ or gelatinous masses and do not diffuse readily 
or at all through animal membranes Graham called the first class ‘crj s- 
talloids’ and the second ‘colloids’, from the Greek word for glue 

In the beginning colloids were regarded as special ‘substances’, but 
it was found that this point of view was not correct. For instance, XaCl 
may behave in solution either as a cr}stalloid or as a colloid, so we 
began to speak about the colloidal state Of late, e\ en this term became 
unsatisfactory and is often supplanted by the term 'colloidal behaviour’ 
In general, a colloid ma) be described as a ‘system’ consisting of two 
or more ‘phases'. The commonest represent emulsions or suspensions of 
fine particles in a gaseous, liquid, or other medium, the size of the par- 
ticles grading from those barely tnsible microscopically to those of 
molecular dimensions These particles may be either homogeneous solids 
or liquids, or solutions themselves of a small percentage of the medium 
in an otherwise homogeneous complex Such solutions have one charac- 
teristic in common, namelj. that the suspended materials may remain 
almost indefinitely in suspension, because the tendency to settle, due to 
gravity, is counteracted by some other factor tending to keep the par- 
ticles suspended In the mam, colloidal behaviour is not dependent upon 
the physical state or chemistrj' of the finely subdivided materials or of 
the medium ^^'e find colloidal behaviour exhibited not only by colloidal 
suspensions and emulsions wEere solid particles or liquid droplets are in 
a liquid medium, but also when solid particles are dispersed in gaseous 
medium (smokes), or hquid droplets in gaseous media (mists). 

Materials which exhibit this special colloidal behaiiour are always 
in a very fine state of subdivision, so that the ratio of surface exposed 
to volume of material is very large. A sphere containing only 10 cubic 
centimetres, if composed of fine particles 000000025 cm in diameter, 
would have a total area of all the surfaces of the particles nearly equal 
to half an acre ^ It is easy to understand that under such structural con- 
ditions the surface forces become important and play a prominent role 
in colloidal behaviour 



COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR

The smaller the colloidal particles, the closer we come to molecular 
and atomic sizes Since we know atoms represent electrical structures, 
we should not be surprised to find that, in colloids, surface eneigies and 
electrical charges become of fundamental importance, as bj necessity all 
surfaces are made up of electrical charges The surface eneigies operat- 
ing in finely grained and dispersed sj-stems are large, and in their ten- 
dency for a minimum, every two particles or drops tend to become one ; 
because, while the mass is not altered by this change, the surface of one 
larger particle or drop is less than the surface of two smaller ones — an 
elementary geometrical fact Electrical charges have the well-known 
characteristic that like repels like and attracts the unlike In colloids, the 
effect of these factors is of a fundamental, yet opposite, character The 
surface energies tend to unite the particles, to coagulate, flocculate or 
precipitate them In the meanwhile the electrical charges tend to pie- 
serve the state of suspension by repelling the particles from each other 
On the predominance or intensity of one or other of these factors, the 
instability or the stability of a suspension depends 

In general, if ‘tune’ limits are not taken into consideration, colloids 
are unstable complexes, in which continuous transformation takes place, 
which IS induced by light, heat, electric fields, electronic discharges, and 
other forms of energy. These transformations lesult m a great variation 
of the characteristics of the system The dispersed phase alters its 
characteristics and the s}stem begins to coagulate, leachmg a stable state 
when the coagulation is complete This pioccss of transformation of the 
characteristics of the system which define the colloid, and which ends in 
coagulation, is called the ‘ageing’ of the colloid With the coagulation 
complete, the system loses its colloidal behaviour — it is ‘dead’. Both of 
these terms apply to inorganic as w ell as to organic systems. 

Some of the coagulating processes are partial and reversible, and 
take the form of change m viscosity, some are not. Some are slow, 
some extremely rapid, particularly when produced by external agencies 
which alter the colloidal equilibiium 

From what has been said already, it is obvious that colloids, particu- 
larly m organisms, are extremely sensitive and complex structures with 
enormous possibilities as to degree of stability, reversibility , and allow a 
wide range of variation of behaviour When we speak of ‘chemistry’, 
we are concerned with a science which deals with certain materials which 
preserve or alter certain of their characteristics In ‘physics’, we go 
beyond the obvious characteristics and try to discover the structure 
underlying these characteristics Modern researches show clearly that 
atoms have a very complex sti ucture and that the macroscopic character- 



114 


III NON-ELEMEXTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


istics are directly connected with sub-microscopic structure If we can 
alter this structure, we usually can alter also the chemical or other char- 
actenstics As the processes in colloids are largely structural and phys- 
ical, anjlhing which tends to have a structural effect usually also disturbs 
the colloidal equilibrium, and then different macroscopic effects appear. 
As these changes occur as senes of interrelated events, the best w ay is to 
consider colloidal behar lour as a physico-electro-chemical occurrence. But 
once the word ‘ph} sical’ enters, structural implications are invoU ed This 
explains also why all known forms of radiant energj', being structures, 
can affect or alter colloidal structures, and so have marked effect on 
colloids 

As all life IS found in the colloidal form and has many characteris- 
tics found also in inorganic colloids, it appears that colloids supply us 
with the most important known link between the inorganic and the 
orgamc This fact also suggests entirely new fields for the study of the 
living cells and of the optimum conditions for their development, sanity 
included. 

Many writers are not agreed as to the use of the terms ‘film’, 
‘membrane’, and the like Empirically discovered structure show s clearly, 
however, that we deal with surfaces and surface energies and that a 
‘surface tension film’ behaves as a membrane In the present work, w’e 
accept the obvious fact that organized systems are film-partitioned 
systems 

One of the most baffling problems has been the peculiar periodicity 
or rhythmicity which we find in life Lately, Lillie and others have 
shown that this rhythmicity could not be explained by purely physical 
nor purely chemical means, but that it is satisfactorily explained when 
treated as a physico-electro-clieuucal structural occurrence The famous 
experiments of Lillie, who used an iron wire immersed in nitric acid and 
reproduced, experimentally, a beautiful periodicity resembling closely 
some of the activities of protoplasm and the nervous system, show con- 
clusively that both the living and the non-living systems depend for their 
rhythmic behaviour on the chemically alterable film, w'hich divides the 
electrically conducting phases In the iron wire and nitric acid experi- 
ment, the metal and the acid represent the two phases, and betw'een the 
two there is found a thin film of oxide In protoplasmic structures, such 
as a nerve fibre, the internal protoplasm and the surrounding medium are 
the tw o phases, separated by a surface film of modified plasm membrane 
In both systems, the electromoti\e characteristics of the surfaces are 
determined by the character of the film * 



COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR 


115 


That living organisms are film-bounded and partitioned systems 
accounts also for irritability It appears that irritability manifests itself 
as sensitiveness to electrical currents. These currents seem to depend on 
polarizability or resistance to the passage of ions, owing to the presence 
of semi-permeable boundary films or surfaces enclosing or partitioning 
the system It is obvious that we are here dealing with complex struc- 
tures which are intimately connected with the characteristics of life 
Living protoplasm is electrically sensitive only as long as its structure is 
intact With death, semi-permeability and polarizability are lost, together 
with electrical sensitivity. 

One of the baffling peculiarities of organisms is the rapidity with 
which the chemical and metabolic processes spread Indeed, it is impos- 
sible to explain this by the transportation of material All evidence 
shows that electrical and, perhaps, other energy factors play an important 
role, and that this activity again depends on the presence of surfaces of 
protoplasmic structures with electrode-like characteristics which form 
circuits. 

The great importance of the electrical charges of the colloidal par- 
ticles arises out of the fact that they prevent particles from coalescing; 
and when the.se charges are neutralized, the particles tend to form larger 
aggregates and settle out of the solution Because of these charges, when 
an electrical current is sent through a colloidal solution, the differently 
charged particles wander to one or the other electrode This process is 
called cataphoresis There is an important difference m behaviour in 
inorganic and organic colloids under the influence of electrical currents, 
and this is due to the difference in structure In inorganic colloids, an 
electrical current does not coagulate the whole, but only that portion of 
it in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes Not so in living proto- 
plasm Even a weak current usually coagulates the entire protoplasm, 
because the mter-cellular films probably play the role of electrodes and 
so the entire protoplasm structurally represents the ‘immediate vicinity’ 
of the electrodes Similarly, structure also accounts for the extremely 
rapid spread of some effects upon the whole of the organism 

Electrical phenomena in living tissue are mainly of two more or less 
distinct characters The first include electromotive energy which pro- 
duces electrical currents m nerve tissue, the membrane potentials , The 
second are called, by Freundlich, electrokinetic, and include cataphoresis, 
agglutination , There is much evidence that the mechanical work of the 
muscles, the secretory action of the glands, and the electrical work of 
the nerve cells are closely connected with the colloidal structure of these 
tissues This would explain why any factor (semantic reactions included) 



116 III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 

capable of altering the colloidal structure of the living protoplasm must 
have a maiked effect on the behaviour and welfare of the organism 

Experiments show that there are four mam factors which are able 
to disturb the colloidal equilibrium. (1) Physical, as, for instance, 
X-rays, radium, light, ultra-violet rays, cathode rays , (2) Mechanical, 
such as friction, puncture . ; (3) Chemical, such as tar, paraffin, arsenic ; 
and, finally, (4) Biological, such as microbes, parasites, spermatozoa. 
In man, another (fifth) potent factor, namely, the semantic reactions, 
enters, but about this factor, I shall speak later. 

For our purpose, the effects produced by the physical factors, 
because obviously structural, are of mam interest, and we shall, there- 
fore, summarize some of the experimental structural results Electrical 
currents of different strength and duration, as well as acids of different 
concentration, or addition of metallic salts, which produce marked acid- 
ity, usually coagulate the protoplasm, these effects being structurally 
interrelated Slow coagulation involves changes in viscosity, all of which, 
under certain conditions, may be reversible ® When cells are active, their 
fluidity often changes in a sharp and rapid manner * 

Fat solvents are called surface-active materials ; when diluted, they 
decrease protoplasmic viscosity , but more concentrated solutions produce 
increased viscosity or coagulation ® The anaesthetics, which always are 
fat solvents and surface-active materials, are very instructive in their 
action for our purpose, as they affect very diversified types of protoplasm 
similarly, this similarity of action being due to the similarity of colloidal 
structure Thus, ether of equal concentration will make a man uncon- 
scious, will prevent the movement of a fish and the wriggling of a worm, 
or stop the activity of a plant cell, without permanently injuring the 
cells ® In fact, the action of all drugs is based on their effect upon the 
colloidal equilibrium, without which action a drug would not be effective 
It IS well known that various acids or alkalis always change the electrical 
resistance of the protoplasm ’ 

The working of the organism involves mostly a structural and very 
important 'vicious circle’, which makes the character of colloidal changes 
non-addttive If, for instance, the heart, for any reason, slows down the 
circulation, this produces an accumulation of carbonic acid m the blood, 
which again increases the viscosity of the blood and so throws more 
work on the already weakened heart ® Under such structural conditions, 
the results may accumulate very rapidly, even at a rate which can be 
expressed as an exponential function of higher degree 

Different regions of the organism have different charges , but, in 
the main, an injured, or excited, or cooler part is electro-negative (which 



COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR 


117 


IS connected with acid formation), and the electro-positive particles rush 
to those parts and supply the material for whatever physiological need 
there may be ® 

The effects of different forms of radiant energy on colloids and 
protoplasm are being extensively studied, and the results are i cr\ start- 
ling The different forms of radiant energy differ in wave-length, fre- 
quency , — that is to say, generally in structure, — and, as such, may 
produce structural effects on colloids and organisms, which effects may 
appear on the gross macroscopic level in many diffeient foims 

Electrical currents, for instance, retard reversibly the growth of 
roots, may activate some eggs into larval stages without fertilization , 
which makes it possible to understand why, in some cases, a mere punc- 
turing of the egg may disturb the equilibrium and produce the effects of 
fertilization 

The X-, or Rontgen-rays have been shown to accelerate 150 
times the process of mutation Muller, in his experiments with several 
thousand cultures of the fruit fly, has established the above ratio of 
induced mutations, which become hereditary ‘Cosmic rays’ in the 
form of radiation from the earth, in tunnels, for instance, show similar 
results, except that mutation occurs only twice as often as under the 
usual laboratory conditions Under the influence of X-rays, mice change 
their colour of hair, gray mice become w'hite, and white ones darker. 
Sometimes further additional bodily changes appear , as, for instance, 
one or no kidneys, abnormal eyes or legs, occur more often than under 
ordinary conditions Some animals lose their pow'er of reproduction, 
although the body is not obviously changed Plants respond also to the 
X-ray treatment They grow faster, flower more, and produce new 
forms more readily In humans the effect of X-ray irradiation has often 
proven disastrous to the health of experimenters There are even data 
that the irradiation of pregnant mothers may result in deformation of 
the head and limbs of the unborn child and, in one-third of the cases, 
feeble-mmdedness of the children has resulted 

Ultra-violet rays also show a marked effect In some instances, they 
slow down or stop the streaming of protoplasm, because of increased 
viscosity or coagulation , plants grow slowdy or rapidly ; certain valuable 
ingredients in plants are increased, certain animals, as, for instance, 
small Crustacea or bacteria are killed, eggs of Nereis (a kind of sea 
worm), which usually have 28 chromosomes, after irradiation have 70; 
certain bone malformations in children are cured , the toxin in the blood 
serum of pernicious anaemia patients is destroyed , In this respect, we 
should notice again that ultra-violet irradiation produces curative effects 



118 III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 

like those of cod-liver oil, which shows that the effect of both factors 
IS ultimately colloidal and structural 

Extensive experimentation with cathode rays is very recent, but 
already we have a most astonishing array of structural facts Moist air 
is converted into nitric acid, synthetic rubber is produced rapidly, the 
milk from rubber trees is made solid and insoluble without the use of 
sulphur, liquid forms of bakelite are solidified without heating, linseed 
oil becomes dry to the touch in three hours and hard in six hours, certain 
materials, like cholesterol, yeast, starch, cottonseed oil, after exposure 
for thirty seconds, heal rickets, and similar unexpected results What are 
usually called ‘vitamins’ do not only represent ‘special substances’, but 
become structurally active factors, and this is why ultra-violet rays 
may produce results like those of some ‘substance’ It seems that m ‘vita- 
mins’ the surface activities are important, the parallelism shown by 
von Hahn between the surface activities of different materials and the 
Funk table of vitamin content is qmte suggestive Some data seem toi 
show that, in some instances, surface-active materials, such as coffee or 
alcohol, produce beneficial surface actmties similar to the ‘vitamins’ 
The above short list gives only an approximate picture of the over- 
whelming importance of the roles which structure in general, and col- 
loids in particular, play in our lives We see about us many human types 
Some are delicate, some are heavy-set, some flabby, some puffy, all of 
which indicates a difference in their colloidal structure Paired with these 
physical colloidal states are also nervous, ‘mental’, and other character- 
istics, which vary from weak and nervous to the extreme limitation of 
nervous activities, as in idiocy, which is a negation of activity 

It is curious that in all illnesses, whether ‘physical’ or ‘mental’, the 
symptoms are very few, and fundamentally of a standard type In 
‘physical’ illness we find the following common characteristics, fever, 
chills, headaches, convulsions, vomiting, diarrhoea. In ‘mental’ ills, 
identifications, illusions, delusions, and hallucinations — in general, the 
reversed pathological order — are found It is not difficult to understand 
the reason Because of the general colloidal background of life, different 
disturbances of colloidal equilibrium should produce similar symptoms 
In fact, many of these symptoms have been reproduced experimentally 
by injecting inert precipitates incapable of chemical reactions, which have 
induced artificial colloidal disturbances Thus, if the serum from an epi- 
leptic patient is injected into a guinea pig, it results in an attack of con- 
vulsions, often ending in death But, if the guinea pig is previously made 
immune by an injection of some colloid which accustoms the nerve- 
endings to the colloidal flocculation, then, for a few hours following, we 



COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR 


119 


can, with impunity, introduce into the circulation otherwise fatal doses 
of epileptic serum Epileptic serum can also be made immune by filtra- 
tion, or by strong centrifugation, or by long standing, which frees it 
from colloidal precipitates 

Death through blood transfusion or the injection of any colloid into 
the circulation has also, m the mam, similar symptoms, regardless of 
the chemical character of the colloid, indicating once more the importance 
and fundamental character of structure.^® 

That illnesses are somehow connected with colloidal disturbances 
(note the wording of this statement) becomes quite obvious when we 
consider catarrhal diseases, inflammations, swellings, tumours, cancer, 
blood thrombi , which involve colloidal injuries, resulting in extreme 
cases m complete coagulation or fluidification, the variation between ‘gel’ 
and ‘sol’ appearing in a most diversified manner Other illnesses are 
connected with precipitation or deposits of various materials Gout, for 
instance, results from a morbid deposit of uric acid, and different con- 
cretions, such as the ‘stones’, are very often found in different fluids of 
the organism We have, thus, concretions in the intestines, the bile, the 
urine, the pancreas, the salivary glands, lime deposits in old softened 
tissues, ‘nee bodies’ m the joints, ‘brain sand’, 

In bacterial diseases, the micro-organisms rapidly produce acids and 
bases which tend to destroy the colloidal equilibrium Lately, it has 
been found that even tuberculosis is more than a mere chapter m bac- 
teriology All the mam tubercular symptoms can be reproduced, experi- 
mentally, by means of colloidal disturbances without the intervention of 
a single bacterium This would explain also why, in some instances, 
psychotherapy is effective in diseases with tubercular symptoms ““ 

By structural necessity, every expression of cellular activity involves 
some sort of colloidal behaviour, and any factor disturbing the colloidal 
structure must be disturbing to the welfare of the organism Vice versa, 
a factor which is beneficial to the organism must reach and affect the 
colloids. 

After this brief account of the structural peculiarities of the domain 
m which life is found, we can understand the baffling ‘body-mind’ prob- 
lem We do not yet know as many details as we could wish, but these 
will accumulate the moment a general solution is clearly formulated It 
IS a well-established experimental fact that all nervous and ‘mental’ 
activities are connected with, or actually generate, electrical currents, 
which of late are scrupulously studied by the aid of an instrument called 
the psychogalvanometer It is not suggested that electrical currents are 
the only ones which are involved There may be many different forms 



120 


III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


of radiant energy produced or effective, which we have not yet the instru- 
ments to lecoid Experiments suggest such a possibility. Thus, for 
instance, the apex of a certain rapidly growing vegetable or animal tissue 
emits some sort of invisible radiation which stimulates the growth of 
living tissue with which it is not in contact The tip of a turnip or onion 
root, if placed at right angles to another root, at a distance of a quarter 
of an inch, so stimulates the growth of the latter that the increase of the 
number of cells, on its side nearest the point of stimulation, is as high as 
seventy per cent These radiations accelerate the growth of some bac- 
teria Other examples could be given 

A classical example of the effect left on protoplasm by energetic 
factors IS given by Bovie 

As yet, we have not assumed that the protoplasm of plants also 
shows lasting structural and functional results of stimulation, some sort 
of ‘learning’ or ‘habit-formation’ characteristics But such is the case, 
and further experimentation along these lines will help greatly to under- 
stand the mechanism of ‘mental’ processes in ourselves 

If we take the seed of a plant, for instance, of a squash, and keep 
it m a moist tropism chamber m the dark, it will grow a root When the 
root is about one inch long, we begin our experiment Originally, under 

the influence of gravitation, the root grows 
vertically doivnwards (A) If we rotate the 
tropism chamber 90“” so that the root is hori- 
zontal (B), the root will soon bend down- 
wards under the influence of positive geotrop- 
ism But the bending does not occur at once 
There is a latent period — in the case of the 
squash seed, about ten minutes — after which 
pause the root is bent downwards When we 
have determined this latent period for a given 
seedling, we then rotate the chamber to the 
positions (B), (C), (A), (B), (C) , just 
within the ‘time’ limit before the bending 
would occur We repeat such procedure sev- 
eral times When we set the root again in its vertical downward position 
(A), we notice that the root, without any more changes of position, will 
wag backwards and forward with the period as was used in the experi- 
ment This unexpected behaviour will last for several days It show's 
that the alternating stimulus of gravitation, as applied to the root, has 
produced some structural changes in the protoplasm which persist for a 
comparatively long period after the stimulus has ceased to act It be- 




COLLOIDAL BEHAVIOUR 


121 


comes obvious that teachability and the structural tendency for forming 
engrams is a general characteristic of protoplasm 

All the examples given above show clearly that structure m general, 
and of colloids in particular, gives us a satisfactory basis for the under- 
standing of the equivalence between occurrences which belonged for- 
merly to ‘chemistry’ and those classified as ‘physical’, and ultimately 
between these and those we call ‘mental’ Structure, and structure alone, 
gives not only the unique content of what we call ‘knowledge’, but also 
the bridge between the different classes of occurrences — a fact which, as 
yet, has not been fully understood. 

I To sum up It is known that colloidal behaviour is exhibited by 
materials of very fine subdivision, the ‘world of neglected dimensions’, 
which involves surface activities and electrical characters of manifold 
and complex structure, and therefore the flexibility of gross macroscopic 
characteristics It is well known that all life-processes, ‘feelings’, ‘emo- 
tions’, ‘thought’, semantic reactions, and so forth, involve at least elec- 
trical currents As electrical currents and other forms of energy are able 
to affect the colloidal structure on which our physical characteristics 
depend, obviously ‘feelings’, ‘emotions’, ‘thought’ , in general, sr, which 
are connected with manifestations of energy, will also have some effect 
on our bodies, and vice versa Colloidal structure supplies us with an 
extremely flexible mechanism with endless possibilities ' 

When we analyse the known empirical facts from a structural point 
of view, we find not only the equivalence which was mentioned before, 
but we must, also, legitimately consider the so-called ‘mental’, ‘emotional’, 
and other semantic and nervous occurrences in connection with manifes- 
tations of energy w'hich have a powerful influence on the colloidal 
behaviour, and so ultimately on the behaviour of our organisms as-a- 
W'hole Under such eni ironmental conditions, we must take into account 
all energies which have been discovered, semantic reactions not excluded, 
as all such energies have structural effect As language is one of the 
expressions of one of these energies, we ought to find it quite natural 
that the structure of language finds its reflection in the structure of the 
environmental conditions which are dependent on it 

Until lately, the disregard of colloidal science and of structure in 
general has greatly retarded advance in biology, psychiatry, and other 
sciences 'biology, for instance, has mostly studied ‘life’ where none 
existed , namely, in death If w'e study corpses, we study death, not life, 
and life is a function of living cells The living cell is senii-fluid, and 
all the forces which act m colloidal solutions and constitute colloidal

behaviour are acting because they can act, while a dead cell is coagulated 
and su a different set of energies is operating there '' 

Should we wonder that life, being a form of colloidal behaviour on 
microscopic and sub-microscopic levels, conditioned by little colloidal 
‘wholes’, and structures separated from their environment by surfaces, 
preserves a similar character on macroscopic levels ^ We should, instead, 
be surprised if this did not turn out to be the case.

Section A Illustrations from biology 

Because of the semantic importance of the structural non-elemental- 
istic principle, and the weighty, yet in the beginning odd, consequences 
which follow the consistent application of this principle iii piactice, we 
will give a short account of some other experimental structural facts 
taken from widely separated fields 

A worm, a marine planarian, called a Thysanocoon (Brochit), is 
common in the bay of Naples If we put a normal Thysanocoon on its 
back, it soon will right itself When the brain of the worm has been 
removed, under similar conditions of the experiment, the w'orm will right 
itself, but more slowly In this case, we see a general tendency of the 
organism-as-a-whole , the nervous system only facilitated a quicker 
action. If we cut the worm partly in two, so that the longitudinal nerves 
are severed, but a thin piece of tissue keeps the two parts together, the 
two parts move in a co-ordinated way, as if not cut The organism still 
works as-a-whole, although the conditions seem not fav'ourable 

If we cut a fresh- water planarian {Planar la torva) in two, trans- 
versely, the posterior part, which has no brain, moves about as well as 
the anterior part, which has the brain If we try to find the effect of light 
on the part devoid of brain and eyes, we see that the effect of light is 
not changed, and that the posterior part crawds away from light into 
dark corners as a normal animal would, except that the action takes place 
at a slower rate In normal animals, the reaction usually begins in about 
one minute after the exposure , in the brainless part, it takes nearly five 
minutes of exposure ^ 

How chemical conditions affect the activities of the organism-as-a- 
whole can be well illustrated by the following examples In a jellyfish, 
vve can increase or decrease the locomotor activities by simply changing 
the chemical constitution of the water If we increase the number of 
Na ions in the sea-w^ater, the rhythmical contractions increase and the 
animal becomes restless If we increase the number of Ca ions, the con- 
tractions decrease In a similar way, we can change the orientation 
toward light in a number of marine animals by changing the constitution 

123 



124 


III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


of the medium. The larvae of Polygordtus, which usually go away from 
light into dark corners, can be compelled to go toward light by two 
methods: either b}' lowering the temperature of the sea-i\ater, or else by 
increasing the concentration of the salts m the sea-water This behaviour 
can be reversed by raising the temperature or lowering the concentration 
of the salts ^ 

An extremely instructive group of experiments has been performed 
in artificial fertilization of the eggs of a large number of marine animals, 
such as starfish, molluscs, and others 

Under usual conditions, these eggs cannot develop unless a sperma- 
tozoon enters the egg, which results in a thickening of the membrane called 
the ‘fertilization membrane’ Experiments show that such a transforma- 
tion can be produced artificially in an unfertilized egg, with resulting 
‘fertilization’, by several artificial means, as, for instance, by the treat- 
ment of the eggs with special chemicals, and, in some instances, by merely 
puncturing the egg with a needle The late Jacques Loeb succeeded in 
producing in this way parthenogenetic frogs, which lived a normal life * 

Under normal conditions, the eggs of different sea animals can be 
fertilized only by their proper sperm But, if we raise the alkalinity of 
the sea-water slightly, we find that the eggs can be fertilized by different 
sperms, often of widely separated kinds of animals ® If we put unfertil- 
ized eggs of a sea-urchin into sea-water which contains a trace of sapo- 
nin, w'e find that the eggs acquire the characteristic ‘membrane of 
fertilization' If the eggs are taken out, washed carefully and put back 
into sea-water, they develop into larvae® The change in the chemical 
constitution of sea-w'ater wull also often produce twins from one egg 
Change in temperature may change the colour of butterflies , ’’ 

A very large class of such orgamsm-as-a-whole reactions is gnen 
in the w'orks of Professor C M Child on regeneration I suggest these 
works, not only because they are particularly interesting, even to the 
layman, but mainly because Professor Child has formulated a A biolog- 
ical system, the importance of which is becoming paramount, and is 
beginning to be applied even m psychiatry by Dr Wm A White and 
others 

We find the characteristic of profiting by past experiences aild 
acquiring negative reactions very low' in the scale of life Thus, even 
infusoria, which ingest a grain of carmine, soon learn to refuse it ® Most 
interesting experiments were performed on worms by Yerkes in 1912 
and verified repeatedly Yerkes built a T-shaped maze In one arm (C) 
he placed a piece of sand-paper (S), beyond which there was an elec- 



THE ‘OEGANISM-AS-A- WHOLE’ 


125 


trical device (E) which could give an electrical shock. The animal used 
for experimenting was an earthworm The worm was admitted through 
the entrance (A) If he selected his 
way through (B), he got out without q 

disagreeable consequences If he se- 
lected (C), he received, first, a fair 
warning through the sand-paper (S) 
and, if this was not enough, he received 
an electrical shock at (E) After a 
number of experiences, the worm 
learned his lesson and avoided the path 
(C) After this habit was acquired, 
the five anterior segments of the worm 
were cut off The beheaded worm re- 1 

tamed the habit, although it reacted 

more slowly During the following two months, the worm grew a new 
brain and the habit disappeared When trained again, he partially re- 
acquired the above habit Further experiments established that normal 
worms acquire the avoiding habit m approximately tw o hundred trials ; 
and when the electrical device was put iii the other arm, the worm 
learned how to reverse his habit m about sixty-five trials Once the habit 
was acquired, the removal of the brain did not alter it Worms wuth 
removed brains w ere also able to acquire a similar habit Since the brain 
of an earthworm is a a er)- small part of his w hole nervous system, it has 
only a small dominance, and the neuro-muscular habits are acquired by 
the whole system and not simply b} the brain But, w hen a new brain 
began to operate, its dominance was seemingly sufficient to eliminate 
the habit ® 

Experiments of McCracken with silkworm moths have showm that 
a beheaded moth can h\e as long as a normal one It can be mated and 
will lay the normal number of fertile eggs arranged m the usual way 
But It will not lay eggs spontaneously, and cannot select the proper kind 
of leaves on which to deposit them If the head and the thorax were cut 
off, the females were unable to mate and their life was shortened to 
about five days If mated before the operation, they would still lay eggs 
when stimulated 

In these more complicated cases, the brain is necessary for the more 
complicated behaviour, as, for instance, the selection of a mulberry leaf 
Although the organism w'orks as-a-whole, the differentiation and relative 
importance (domination) of different organs becomes more accentuated, 
the higher we go m the scale of life.

We find striking illustrations of the non-el principle in the study of 
‘vitamins’ A few years ago it was discovered that certain widely spread 
and pernicious diseases were due to deficiencies of some factors m diet 
These factors, which normally are present in very minute amounts, were 
called ‘vitamins’ by the Polish biologist. Funk The most important 
vitamm-deficiency diseases are called Rickets, Scurvy, Ben-Ben, and 
Pellagra In all these cases, it is important to notice that the lack of a 
minute amount of some factor may have the most varied, pronounced, 
and seemingly unrelated consequences The symptoms can now be pro- 
duced deliberately on experimental animals, by diets free from the par- 
ticular ‘\itamins’ and can also be cured at will by feeding them with 
the proper ‘vitamins’ 

Rickets appears essentially as a disease of infancy or childhood In 
mild cases, the disease may only be discovered after the death of the 
adult In these cases, the lesions have not become pronounced enough 
during life to attract attention 

The diagnosis usually depends on manifestations m the bones, but 
rickets affects the whole organism and not merely the skeleton The 
children are nervous and irritable, but apathetic They sleep poorly and 
perspire excessively The muscles become wasted and weak Often a 
secondary anaemia occurs The children sit, stand, and walk later than 
usual , the teeth appear later in life and decay sooner The bones usually 
become much affected Areas of softening appear in the long bones, 
which become bent In more severe cases, the bones may even become 
fractured and the head of the bone may separate from the shaft The 
general resistance of the children to other diseases is lowered and mor- 
tality increases 

Cod liver oil or sunshine usually effects a cure We should notice 
the little word ‘or’, for quite diffeient ‘causes’ produce similar ‘effects’ — 
an example illustrating that in life ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ do not correspond 
m a one-to-one relation, but in a many-to-one relation 

Experiments have shown that not less than three primary dietary 
factors are concerned with the development of skeletal tissue These are 
phosphorus, calcium, and at least one organic compound which is known 
as antirachjtic vitamin The work of Professor E V McCollum and 
his co-workers seems to show an interesting point , namely, that the 
ratio between the concentrations of calcium and of phosphorus m the 
food may be more important than the absolute amounts of these 
substances

Scurvy develops gradually The patient loses weight, appears anae- 
mic, pale, weak, and short of breath The gums become swollen, bleed 
easily, and often develop ulcers The teeth loosen and may fall out. 
Hemorrhages between the mucous membranes and the skin often occur. 
Blue-black spots in the skin are very easily produced, or even occur 
spontaneously. The ankles become swollen, and, m severe cases, the skin 
becomes hard Nervous symptoms of a varied character appear, some of 
which are due to the rupture of blood vessels. In later stages of the dis- 
ease, delirium and convulsions may occur Autopsy reveals significant 
data, namely, hemorrhages and fragility of the bones Scurvy appears 
also as a deficiency disease, produced mainly by the lack in food of the 
so-called ‘anti-scorbutic vitamin' 

Ben-Ben labels a form of inflammation of the peripheral nerves, 
the nerves of motion and sensation being equally affected In the begin- 
ning of the disease, the patient feels fatigue, depression, and stiffness of 
the legs We distinguish two forms, the wet and the dry In the dry 
form, wasting, anaesthesia and paralysis are the chief manifestations 
The most marked manifestation in the wet form is the accumulation of 
serum in the cellular tissue affecting the trunks, limbs and extremities 
Usually, in both forms, there appear tenderness of the calf muscles and 
a tingling or burning m the feet, legs, and arms The mortality is high. 

Pellagra involves the nervous system, the digestive tract, and skin. 
Normally, one of the first symptoms to appear is soreness and inflamma- 
tion of the mouth. Symmetrical redness of the skin occurs on parts of 
the body The nervous symptoms become more pronounced as the dis- 
ease advances The spinal cord is particularly involved, but the central 
nervous system is also often affected 

Speaking about ‘vitamins’ and how their absence affects the organ- 
ism-as-a-whole, we should mention that ster lity in females may be con- 
nected with lack of vitamins Astonishing experiments by Professor' 
McCollum showed that such diverse phenomena as loss of weight, pre- 
mature old age, high infant mortality , are largely due to diet, and that 
even such fundamental instincts as the motherly instinct are also affected. 
The normally nourished rat very seldom destroys its young and, _ as a rule, 
rats are good mothers If we put such a mother rat on an abundant diet 
that is deficient m some vitamins, the mother reacts quite differently 
toward her young and destroys them soon after their birth This char- 
acteristic has been controlled experimentally, and reversed at will by 
proper diets Nervousness and irritability in rats can also be controlled 
experimentally by means of the vitamins they receive, or lack in food.

III NON-ELEMENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 


Section C Illustrations from 'mental' and nervous diseases 

Simple and striking examples of what the non-el principle means 
can also be given from psychiatry 

White quotes the report of Pnnce that a patient was subject to 
severe attacks of hay fever when exposed to roses On one occasion, a 
bunch of roses was unexpectedly produced from behind a screen. The 
patient started a severe attack with all the usual symptoms, lachryma- 
tion. congestion of the mucosa , although the roses were made of paper. 
This interesting case shows clearly how ‘mental’ factors (the belief that 
the roses were genuine) produce a series of reactions involving sensory, 
motor, vasomotor disturbances, and secretory disturbances of a definitely 
‘physical’ character 

Migraine labels a disturbance in the tension of blood vessels 
(vasomotor), which is due to a great variety of possible stimuli acting 
on the vegetative nervous system In some instances, the stimuli may 
be purely physical, as severe blows, falls, fast movements, sudden altera- 
tion in temperature, of pressure , or they may be chemical, and due to 
nicotine, alcohol, morphine, or to some endocrmal disturbances (adrenals, 
thyroid), toxins , They may be of a purely somatic reflex character, due 
to fatigue, tumour formations , They may also be of a semantic charac- 
ter, due to anger, fear, disappointment, worry, and other semantic states, 
which may act by disturbing the metabolism 

Migraine appears usually as a periodical abnormal state, in which 
the patient suffers from an oppressive pain in the head which gradually 
passes from heaviness and dullness to splitting intensity Often charac- 
teristic visual signs also appear The patient sees dark spots m the 
visual field, flying specks, and may become even partially blind Chilli- 
ness, depression, sensory disturbances, particularly in the stomach, with 
vomiting, are often present An attack may last a few hours or even 
several days 

Cretinism labels a physical and ‘mental’ disturbance due mainly to 
the loss or diminution of the function of the thyroid gland The 
patient (child) falls behind in his physical development, which often 
results m dwarfism, except for the skull, which grows larger m propor- 
tion to the rest of the body The bone defects give rise to widely sepa- 
rated eyes, pug nose. The bony tissue becomes unusually hard, and 
there is also a marked dental deficiency The neck is usually thick and 
short, the abdomen puffy, the navel sunken The hair line begins low on 
the forehead, the nose is sunken, the eyelids swollen, the face puffy, the 
tongue protruding The liver is usually enlarged, respiration is slow, and

changes m the blood can be detected. The nervous system is affected : 
we also find defects in sensory and motor nerve structure On the 
‘mental’ level, we find different degrees of stupidity, ‘mental’ weakness 
(morons), imbecility, and even idiocy Smell, eyesight, and hearing are 
often poor, speech disturbed, so that we often find the patients deaf and 
dumb The patients have an unsteady gait, with wobbling of the head. 
Over-activity of the thyroid gland results in the well-known goitre. 

Hyperpituitarism results m acromegaly, characterized by the grad- 
ual enlargement of the bones of the nose, jaw, hands and feet, gigantism, 
often connected with profound disturbances Hypopituitarism, or defi- 
ciency of the pituitary hormones, gives rise to a group of diseases char- 
acterized by a progressive accumulation of fat, and is connected with 
other abnormalities and disturbances 

From the field of the psychoneuroses, I shall mention only hysteria. 
It IS very interesting to note that the many and various physical and 
somatic symptoms are of a purely semantic origin The symptoms of 
hysteria are many and very complex, but they group themselves mainly 
in disturbances of motion and ‘sensation’ We find every kind of paraly- 
sis and anaesthesia Paralysis of the limbs is frequent, anaesthesia may 
be distributed in many ways, involving the superficies or the various 
‘sense-organs’ It is interesting to note that the distribution of these 
symptoms does not follow the anatomical areas of nerve distribution, 
but shows a symbolic (psycho-logical) grouping The disturbances of 
motility are usually in the form of paralysis Tremors, muscular debility, 
fatigability, involuntary muscular twitching, tics and spasms are often 
hysterical in origin Speech is often involved, sometimes patients can 
only whisper, although their vocal organs are healthy Stuttering is 
often hysterical, and analysis shows that the words which give difficul- 
ties usually have special semantic significance for the patient Respira- 
tory disturbances of an asthmatic character and disturbances of the 
gastro-mtestmal tract are also often hysterical 

It should be emphasized that since non-elementalism has a physico- 
chemical structural base in colloidal behaviour, all life and all organisms 
give ample material for illustration We have given here only a very 
few examples, selected mainly because of their simple and spectacular 
empirical character, but not generally too well known Empirical data 
show clearly that the most diversified factors, acting as partial stimuli, 
ultimately affect or result in the response of the whole 

The handling of such empirical, structural, fundamental problems 
involves serious structural, linguistic and semantic difficulties which have 
to be solved entirely by adjusting the structure of the language used But 
9 



130 III NON-ELEI^IENTALISTIC STRUCTURES 

such adjustment requires a full understanding of the structural issues 
at hand and a fundamental structural departure from A methods and 
means. These structural issues and means of departures from A meth- 
ods are explained in the following chapters 

To sum up The non-el pnnaple formulates a structural character 
inherently found m the structure of the world, ourselves, and our ner- 
vous system on all levels, the knowledge and application of which is 
unconditionally necessary for adjustment on all le\els, and, therefore, in 
humans, for samty 

As ‘knowledge’, ‘understanding’, and such functions are solely rela- 
tional, and, therefore, structural, the unconditional and inherent condi- 
tion for adjustment on all human levels depends on building languages 
of similar structure to the experimental facts. Once this is accomplished, 
all the former desirable semantic consequences follow automatically 

For simplicity, we have considered only examples of the ‘orgamsin- 
as-a-whole’, but, as a matter of fact, such a detached consideration can- 
not be considered entirely satisfactory, as, structurally, every organism 
depends on its em ironment , and, therefore, in building our languages, 
we ought to com terms which also involve the latter by implication 
Fortunately, this condition does not imolve us m serious difficulties, 
when once identity is eliminated and the fundamental problems of struc- 
ture are grasped Indeed, the terms which we have already used, or 
which wull be used as we proceed, are all of such a non-el structure as to 
involve the environment by implication 

In dealing with ‘Smith’, the difficulties are particularly serious 
because his nervous system is the most complex known It is stratified 
four-dimensionally (in space-time), and the dominance of some centres 
introduces prodigious and manifold interrelations non-existent in nervous 
systems of simpler structure , and w'e still have to learn how to handle 
the former Fortunately, mathematical methods and psychiatry explain 
a good deal about this question, and give us the desired means to apply 
what we have learned. 

Obviously, to ‘know’ something is quite different from the habitual 
application of what we have learned This semantic difference is particu- 
larly acute in the case of language, as it involves structural implications 
which work unconsciously. It is not enough to ‘understand’ and ‘know’ 
the content of the present work ; one must tram oneself in the use of the 
new terms. Then only can he expect the maximum semantic results

Without objects conceived as unique individuals, we can have no Classes 
Without classes we can, as we have seen, define no Relations, without re- 
lations we can have no Order But to be reasonable %s to conceive of order- 
systems, real or ideal. Therefore, we have an absolute logical need to conceive 
of individual objects as the elements of our ideal order systems This postulate 
IS the condition of defining clearly any theoretical conception whatever 
The further metaphysical aspects of the concept of an individual we may 
here ignore To conceive of individual objects is a necessary presupposition 
of all orderly activity (449) josiah royce 


The connections shown by these particular examples hold in general 
given a transformation, you have a function and a relation, given a func- 
tion, you have a relation and a transformation, given a relation, you have 
a transformation and a function* one thing — three aspects, and the fact is 
exceedingly interesting and weighty (264) c\ssius j keyser 

It can, you see, be said, with the same approximation to truth, that the 
whole of science, including mathematics, consists in the study of trans- 
formations or in the study of relations (264) cassius j keyser 

Science is never merely knowledge, it is orderly knowledge (449) 

JOSIAH ROYCE 


Philosophers have, as a rule, failed to notice more than two types of 
sentence, exemplified by the two statements "this is yellow” and "butter- 
cups are yellow ” They mistakenly suppose that these two were one and 
the same type, and also that all propositions were of this type. The former 
error was exposed by Frege and Peano, the latter was found to make the 
explanation of order impossible Consequently the traditional view that 
all propositions ascribe a predicate to a subject collapsed, and with it the 
metaphysical systems which were based upon it, consciously or uncon- 
sciously. (457) BERTRAND RUSSELL 


Interesting analyses by Van Woerkom have shown a general incapacity 
in aphasics for grasping relations, realizing ordered syntheses, etc , all of 
them are operations which are based, in the normal individual, on the use 
of verbal symbolization When confronted by groups of figures or of geo- 
metrical forms, the aphasic, even though he may perceive them correctly, 
IS unable to analyse or to order the elements, to grasp their succession 
(411) HENRI FI£rON

CHAPTER XI 


ON FUNCTION 

The whole science of mathematics rests upon the notion of function, 
that IS to say, of dependence between two or more magnitudes, whose 
study constitutes the principal object of analysis c e fic \rd 

Every one is familiar with the ordinary notion of a function — with the 
notion, that is, of the lawful dependence of one or more variable things 
upon other variable things, as the area of a rectangle upon the lengths of 
its sides, as the distance traveled upon the rate of going, as the volume of 
a gas upon temperature and pressure, as the prosperity of a throat specialist 
upon the moisture of the climate, as the attraction of material particles upon 
their distance asunder, as prohibitionary zeal upon intellectual distinction 
and moral elevation, as rate of chemical change upon the amount or the 
mass of the substance involved, as the turbulence of labor upon the lust 
of capital, and so on and on without end (264) cassius j. keyser 

The infinite which it superficially gets rid of is concealed in the notion 
of “any,” which is but one of the protean disguises of mathematical gen- 
erality (22) E T BELL 

The famous mathematician, Heaviside, mentions the definition of 
quaternions given by an American schoolgirl She defined quaternions 
as 'an ancient religious ceremony'. Unfortunately, the attitude of many 
mathematicians justified such a definition The present work departs 
widely from this religious attitude and treats mathematics simply as a 
most important and unique form of human behaviour There is nothing 
sacred about any single verbal formulation, and even those that now 
seem most fundamental should be held subject to structural revision if 
need should arise The few mathematicians who have produced epoch- 
making innovations m mathematical method had this behaviouristic 
attitude tmconscwusly, as will be shown later The majority of mathema- 
ticians take mathematics as a clear-cut entity, ‘by itself’ This is due, 
first, to a confusion of orders of absti actions and to identification, as 
will be explained later , and, second, to its seeming simplicity In reality, 
such an attitude introduces quite unexpected complications, leading to 
mathematical revolutions, which are always bewildering The mathemat- 
ical revolutions occur only because of this over-simplified, and thus 
fallacious, attitude of the mathematicians toward their work Had all 
mathematicians the semantic freedom of those who make the mathemat- 
ical ‘revolutions’, there would be no mathematical ‘revolutions’, but an 
extremely swift and constructive progress To re-educate the jr of such 
mathematicians, the problem of the psycho-logics of mathematics must 
receive more attention This means that some mathematicians must 


133 



134 IV. STRUCTURAL RECTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


become psycho-logicians also, or that psycho-logicians must study 
mathematics. 

For, let us take a formula which exemplifies mathematics at its best , 
namely, one and one make two (1 -j- 1 =2) We see clearly that this 
human product involves a threefold relation, between the man who 
made it, 

(A) yi + l=2\^ 

Brown-* *- Smith 

let us say, Smith, and the black-on-white marks (A), between these 
marks and Brou n, and between Brown and Smith This last relation- 
ship is the only important one The marks (A) are only auxiliary and 
are meaningless by ‘themselves’ They would never occur if there were 
no Smiths to make them, and would be of no value if there were no 
understanding Brow'ns to use and to appreciate them It is true that 
when we take into account this threefold relation the analysis becomes 
more difficult and must involve a revision of the foundations of mathe- 
matics. Although it IS impossible to attempt m this book a deeper 
analysis of these problems m a general way, yet this behaviounstic atti- 
tude follows the rejection of the ‘is’ of identity, and is applied all 
through this work 

The notion of ‘function’ has played a very great role m the develop- 
ment of modern science, and is structurally and semantically funda- 
mental. This notion was apparently first introduced into mathematical 
literature by Descartes. Leibnitz introduced the term The notion of a 
‘function’ IS based on that of a variable. In mathematics, a variable is 
used as an cc-valued symbol that can represent any one of a series of 
numerical elements. 

It IS useful to enlarge the mathematical meaning of a variable to 
include any co-valued symbol of which the value is not determined 
The various determinations which may be assigned to the variable we 
call the value of the variable. It is important to realize that a mathe- 
matical variable does not vary or change in itself, but can take any value 
within its range. If a particular value is selected for a variable, then 
this value, and, therefore, the variable, becomes fixed — a one-valued 
constant In the use of these terms, we should take into account the 
behaviour of the mathematizer. His 'x' is like a container, into which he 
may pour any or many liquids, but once the selection has been made, 
the content of the container is one or a constant So ‘change’ is not 
inherent in a variable , it is due only to the volition of the mathematizer, 
who can change one value for another Thus, the value changes by 
quanta, in definite lots, according to the pleasure of the operator This 



ON FUNCTION 


135 


quantum character of the variable has serious structural and semantic 
consequences, which will become clearer further on It allows us, with- 
out stretching our definitions, to apply the new vocabulary to any problem 
whatsoever It is in structural accord with the trend of the quantum 
theory, and, therefore, with the structure of this world, as we know it 
at present. 

The notion of a variable originated m mathematics, and, in the be- 
ginning, dealt only with numbers Now numbers, when given, represent, 
structurally, a manifold or aggregate which is not supposed to change 
So, when we consider a variable, we should ‘think’ not of a changing 
entity, but of any element we choose out of our perfectly constant col- 
lection (when given) Let me repeat that the notion of change enters 
in, only in connection with the volition and the sr oi the one who 
operates these unchanging entities The notion of a variable is taken 
always in an exteiisional oo-valued sense, to be explained later, as it 
always implies structurally a collection of many individuals, out of which 
collection a selection of one can be made. The notion of a variable is 
general and, m principle, ai-valued, a constant is a special one-\ allied 
case of a variable m which the collection contains a single elanent, 
making alternative selection impossible 

Variables are usually symbolized by the end letters of the alphabet, 
X, y, s, The supply is increased as desired by the use of indices, for 
instance, x', y', s' , x", y" , s". , or Xi, y,, a, , X 2 , y 2 , S 2 , This gives a 
flexible means of denoting numerous induiduals, and so manufacturing 
them indefinitely, as the extensional method of mathematics requires. 
Another method, introduced not long ago, has proven useful m dealing 
with a definite selection of variables in a simplified manner One letter 
or one equation can be used instead of many The variable sign x is 
modified by another letter which may have difleient lalues, in a given 
range, for instance, a'„ Xk, The modifying letter i or k can take the 
serial values , let us say i or A: = 1, 2. 3 , Since the one symbol A'k stands 
for the array of many different variables Xi, Xo, .r, , statements can be 
greatly simplified, and yet preserve structurally the extensional indi- 
viduality 

It is important that the non-mathematical reader should become 
acquainted with the above methods and notations, as they involve a pro- 
found and far-reaching structural and psycho-logical attitude, useful to 
everybody, involving most fundamental s r. 

The extensional method means dealing structurally with many 
definite individuals , as, for instance, with 1, 2, 3 , a series m which each 
individual has a special and unique name or symbol. This extensional 



136 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


method is structurally the only one by which we may expect to acquire 
A 00 -valued s r In a strict sense, the problems in life and the sciences 
do not differ structurally from this mathematical problem. In life and 
science, one deals with many, actual, unique individuals, and all speak- 
ing IS using abstractions of a very high order (abstractions from 
abstraction from abstraction , ) So, whenever we speak, the individual 
is never completely covered, and some characteristics are left out 

A rough definition of a function is simple, y is said to be a func- 
tion of .*•, if, when x is given, y is determined Let us start with a simple 
mathematical illustration .y = x-\-Z If we select the value 1 for x our 
y=l-}-3 = 4. Ifue select x = 2, then y = 2 -|- 3 = S , Let us take 
a more complicated example, for instance. y = x^ — x-\-2 We see 
that for .r=l, y=l — 1-1-2 =2, for jr = 2, y = 4 — •2-l-2 = 4, for 
A' = 3,y = 9-3 + 2 = 8, 

In general, y is determined when we fulfill all the indicated opera- 
tions upon the variable .*■, and so get the final results of these operations 
In symbols, y = f(x), which is read, y equals function of .*■, or y equals 
f of X. 

In our example, we may call x the independent variable, meaning 
that It is the one to which we may assign any value at our pleasure, if 
not limited by the conditions of our problem, and y would then be the 
dependent variable, which means that its value is no longer dependent 
on our pleasure, but is determined by the selection of the value of x 
The terms dependent and independent variables are not absolute, for 
the dependence is mutual, and we could select either variable as the 
independent one, according to our wishes 

The notion of a ‘function’ has been generalized by Bertrand Rus- 
sell to the very important notion of a ‘propositional function’ ^ For my 
purpose, a rough definition will be sufficient By a propositional func- 
tion, I mean an oo-valued statement, containing one or more variables, 
such that when single values are assigned to these variables the expres- 
sion becomes, m principle, a one-valued proposition The oo-valued 
character of propositional functions seems essential, because we may 
have a one-valued descriptive function with variables, or a one-valued 
expression formulating a semantic relational law expressed m variable 
terms , yet these rvould be propositions Thus, the co-valued statement, 
‘x IS black’, would exemplify a propositional function , but the one-valued 
relation ‘if x is more than y, and y is more than i:, then x is more than 
^ exemplifies a proposition This extended m o notion of a propositional 
function becomes of crucial importance in a /4-system, because most of 
our speaking is conducted in oo-valued languages to which we mostly 



ON FUNCTION 


137 


and delusionally ascribe single values, entirely preventing proper 
evaluation 

An important charactenstic of a propositional function, for instance, 
'jr is black’, is tliat such a statement is neither true nor false, but am- 
biguous. It IS useless to discuss the truth or falsehood of propositional 
functions, since the terms true or false cannot be applied to them But 
if a definite, single value is assigned to the lariable .r. then the proposi- 
tional function becomes a proposition which may be true or false For 
instance, if we assign to -v the value ‘coal’, and say ‘coal is black’, the 
3C -valued propositional funaion has become a one-ialued true proposi- 
tion If we should assign to .r the value ‘milk', and say ‘milk is black', 
this also would make a proposition, but. in this case false If we should 
assign to .r the lalue 'blah-blah' and sa} ‘blah-blah is black', such a 
statement may be considered as meaningless, since it contains sounds 
which ha\e iw meaning, or we way say. ‘the statement blah-blah is )wt 
black but meaningless', and, therefore, the proposition ‘blah-blah is 
black’, IS not meaningless but false 

We should notice — a fact disregarded in the Priiicipta Mathewafica 
— that there is no hard and fast rule by which we can distinguish 
between meaningless and false statements in general, but that such dis- 
crimination depends on many factors in each specific case A proposi- 
tional function, ‘x is black', cannot be its own argument for instance, if 
we substitute the whole propositional function, ‘.r is black*, for the vari- 
able X in the original proprisitional function, and then consider the 
expression, 'x is black is black', which Whitehead and Russell classify as 
wcaiunglcss this expression is jwf necessarily meaningless, but way be 
considered false. For, the statement ‘.r is black', is defined as a proposi- 
tional function, and, therefore, the statement, 'x is black, is black’, way 
be considered false 

The problems of ‘meaning' and ‘meaningless* are of great semantic 
importance in daily life, but, as yet, little has been done, and little re- 
search made, to establish or discover \ahd criteria To prove a given 
statement false is often laborious, and sometimes impossible to do so, 
because of the unde^elnped state of knowledge in that field But with 
meaningless z'ctbal forms, when their meaninglessness is exposed in a 
giien case the non-sense is exploded for good 

From this point of mcw, it is desirable to imestigate more fully the 
mechanism of our symbolism so as to be able to distinguish betiveen 
statements which are false and verbal forms which have no meanings. 
The reader should recall what was said about the term ‘unicorn’, used as 
a symbol m heraldry and, eventually, in ‘psychology’, since it stands for 



138 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


a human fancy, but, in zoology, it becomes a noise and not a symbol, 
since it does not stand for any actual animal whatsoever 

A very curious semantic characteristic is shared m common by a 
propositional function and a statement containing meaningless noises, 
namely, that neither of them can be true or false In the old A way 
all sounds man made, which could be written down and looked like 
words, were considered words , and so every ‘question’ was expected to 
have an answer When spell -marks (noises which can be spelled) were 
put together m a specified way, each combination was supposed to say 
something, and this statement was supposed to be true or false We see 
clearly that this view is not correct, that, in addition to words, we make 
noises (spell-marks) which may have the appearance of being words, 
but should not be considered as words, as they say nothing in a given 
context Propositional functions, also, cannot be classified under the 
simple two opposites of true and false 

The above facts have immense semantic importance, as they are 
directly connected with the possibility of human agreement and adjust- 
ment For upon statements which are neither true nor false we can 
always disagree, if we insist in applying criteria which have no applica- 
tion in such cases 

In hitman life the semantic problems of ‘meaninglessness’ are fun- 
damental for sanity, because the e\aluation of noises, which do not con- 
stitute symbols m a given context as symbols in that context, must, of 
necessity, involve delusions or other morbid manifestations 

The solution of this problem is simple Any noises or signs, when 
used semantically as symbols, alvuays represent some symbolism, but we 
must find out to what field the given symbolism applies We find only 
three possible fields If we apply a symbol belonging to one field to 
another field, it has very often no meaning in this latter In the follow- 
ing considerations, the theory of eriors is disregarded 

A symbol may stand for* (1) Events outside our skin, or inside 
our skin in the fields belonging to physics, chemistry, physiology, (2) 
Psycho-logical events inside our skin, or, in other words, for j r which 
may be considered ‘sane’, covering a field belonging to psycho-logics 
(3) Semantic disturbances covering a pathological field belonging to 
psychiatry 

As the above divisions, together with their interconnections, cover 
the field of human symbolism, which, in 1933, have become, or are rap-

Because of structural and the above symbolic considerations based 
on A negative, non-identity premises, these conclusions appear as final; 
and, perhaps, for the first time bring to a focus the age-long problem 
of the subject-matter, character, value, and, in general, the status of the 
older ‘metaphysics’ m human economy From the non-el, structural, and 
semantic point of view, the problems with which the older ‘metaphysics’ 
and ‘philosophy’ dealt, should be divided into two quite definite groups 
One would include ‘epistemology’, or the theory of knowledge, which 
would ultimately merge with scientific and non-el psycho-logics, based 
on general semantics, structure, relations, multi-dimensional order, and 
the quantum mechanics of a given date, and the rest would represent 
semantic disturbances, to be studied by a generalized up-to-date 
psychiatry 

Obviously, considerations of structure, symbolism, sanity , mvohe 
the solutions of such weighty problems as those of ‘fact’, ‘reality’, ‘true’, 
‘false' , which are completely solved only by the consciousness of ab- 
stracting, the multiordmality of terms , — in general, a /4-system 

Let me repeat the rough definition of a propositional function — 
as an oo-valued statement containing variables and characterized by the 
fact that It IS ambiguous, neithei true nor false 

How about the terms we deal with in life'* Are they all used as 
one-valued terms for constants of some sort, or do we have terms which 
are inherently oo-valued or variable^ How about terms like ‘mankind’, 
‘science’, ‘mathematics’, ‘man’, ‘education’, ‘ethics’, ‘politics’, ‘religion’, 
‘sanity’, ‘insanity’, ‘iron’, ‘w'ood’, ‘apple’, ‘object’, and a host of other 
terms i* Are they labels for one-valued constants or labels for oo-valued 
stages of processes Fortunately, here we have no doubt 

We see that a large majority of the terms we use are names for 
oo-valued stages of processes with a changing content When such terms 
are used, they generally carry different or many contents The terms 
represent oo-valued variables, and so the statements represent oo-valued 
propositional functions, not one-valued propositions, and, therefore, in 
principle, are neither true nor false, but ambiguous 

Obviously, before such propositional functions can become proposi- 
tions, and be true or false, single values must be assigned to the vari- 
ables by some method Here we must select, at least, the use of 
co-ordinates In the above cases, the ‘time’ co-ordinate is sufficient 
Obviously, ‘science 1933’ is quite different from ‘science 1800’ or ‘science 
300 B c 

The objection may be made that it would be difficult to establish 
means by which the use of co-ordinates could be made workable. It 



140 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


seems that this might involve us m complex difficulties But, no matter 
how simple or how complex the means we devise, the details are imma- 
terial, and, therefore, we can accept the roughest and simplest , let us 
say, the year, and usually no spatial co-ordinates The invaluable seman- 
tic effect of such an innovation is structural, one-, versus oD-valued, 
psycho-logical and methodological, and affects deeply our j r 

From time immemorial, some men were supposed to deal in one- 
valued ‘eternal verities’ \Ye called such men ‘philosophers’ or ‘meta- 
physicians’ But they seldom realized that all their ‘eternal verities’ 
consisted only of words, and words which, for the most part, belonged 
to a primitive language, reflecting in its structure the assumed structure 
of the world of remote antiquity Besides, they did not realize that 
these ‘eternal verities’ last only so long as the human nervous system is 
not altered Under the influence of these ‘philosophers’, two-valued 
‘logic’, and confusion of orders of abstractions, nearly all of us con- 
tracted a firmly rooted predilection for ‘general’ statements — ‘umversals’, 
as they were called — which, in most cases, inherently involved the seman- 
tic one-valued conviction of validity for all ‘time’ to come 

If we use our statements with a date, let us say ‘science 1933’, such 
statements have a profoundly modified structural and psycho-logical 
character, different from the old general legislative semantic mood A 
statement concerning ‘science 1933’, whether correct or not, has no ele- 
ment of semantic conviction concerning 1934 

We see, further, that a statement about ‘science 1933’ might be 
quite a definite statement, and that if the person is properly informed. 
It probably would be true Here we come in contact with the structure 
of one of those human semantic impasses which we have pointed out 
We humans, through old habits, and because of the inherent structure 
of human knowledge, have a tendency to make static, definite, and, in 
a way, absolutistic one-valued statements But when we fight absolutism, 
we quite often establish, instead, some other dogma equally silly and 
harmful 'For instance, an active atheist is psycho-logically as unsound 
as a rabid theist’ 

A similar remark applies to practically all these opposites we are 
constantly establishing or fighting for or against The present structure 
of human knowledge is such, as will be shown later, that we tend to make 
definite statements, static and one-valued in character, which, when we 
take into account the present pre-, and A one-, two-, three-valued affec- 
tive components, inevitably become absolutistic and dogmatic and ex- 
tremely harmful 



ON FUNCTION 


141 


It is a genuine and fundamental semantic impasse These static 
statements are very harmful, and yet they cannot be abolished, for the 
present There are even weighty reasons why, without the formulation 
and application of oo-valued semantics, it is not possible (1933) to abol- 
ish them What can be done under such structural circumstances ? Give 
up hope, or endeavour to invent methods which cover the discrepancy 
m a satisfactory (1933) way? The analysis of the psycho-logics of the 
mathematical propositional function and A semantics gives us a most 
satisfactory structural solution, necessitating, among others, a four- 
dimensional theory of propositions 

We see (1933) that we can make definite and static statements, 
and yet make them semantically harmless Here we have an example of 
abolishing one of the old A tacitly-assumed ‘infinities’ The old ‘general’ 
statements were supposed to be true for ‘all time’, in quantitative lan- 
guage it would mean for ‘infinite numbers of years’ When we use the 
date, we reject the fanciful tacit A ‘infinity’ of years of validity, and 
limit the validity of our statement by the date we affix to it. Any reader 
who becomes accustomed to the use of this structural device will see 
what a tremendous semantic difference it makes psycho-logically 

But the above does not exhaust the question structurally We have 
seen that when we speak about oo-valued processes, and stages of 
processes, we use variables m our statements, and so our statements are 
not propositions but propositional functions which are not true or false, 
but are ambiguous But, by assigning single values to the variables, we 
make propositions, which might be true or false, and so investigation 
and agreement become possible, as we then have something definite to 
talk about 

A fundamental structural issue arises in this connection, namely, 
that m doing this (assigning single values to the \ariables), our attitude 
has automatically changed to an extensional one By using our state- 
ments with a date, we deal with definite issues, on record, which we can 
study, analyse, evaluate , and so we make our statements of an exten- 
sional character, with all cards on the table, so to say, at a given date 
Under such extensional and limited conditions, our statements then 
become, eventually, propositions, and, therefore, true or false, depending 
on the amount of information the maker of the statements possesses 
We see that this criterion, though difficult, is feasible, and makes agree- 
ment possible 

A structural remark concerning the -system may not be amiss 
here In the -system the ‘universal’ proposition (which is usually a 
propositional function) always implies existence In A ‘logic’, when it is 



142 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


said that ‘all A’s are B’, it is assumed that there are A’s It is obvious 
that always assuming existence leaves no place for non-existence, and 
this IS why the old statements were supposed to be true or false In 
practical life, collections of noises (spell-marks) which look like words, 
but which are not, are often not suspected of being meaningless, and 
action based on them may consequently entail unexphcable disaster In 
our lives, most of our miseries do not originate in the field where the 
terms ‘true’ and ‘false’ apply, but in the field where they do not apply, 
namely, in the immense region of propositional functions and meaning- 
lessness, where agreement must fail 

Besides, this sweeping and unjustified structural assumption makes 
the ^-system less general To the statement, ‘all A’s are B’, the mathe- 
matician adds ‘there may or may not be A’s’ This is obviously more 
general The old pair of opposites, true and false, may be enlarged to 
three possibilities — statements which might be true, or false, and verbal 
forms which have the appearance of being statements and yet have no 
meaning, since the noises used were spell-marks, not symbols for any- 
thing with actual or ‘logical’ existence 

Again a ^-system shares with the E and N systems a useful and 
important methodological and structural innovation, namely, it limits 
the validity of its statements, with weighty semantic beneficial conse- 
quences, as It tends from the beginning to eliminate undue, and often 
intense, dogmatism, categonsm, and absolutism This, on a printed page, 
perhaps, looks rather unimportant, but when applied, it leads to a fun- 
damental and stiucturally beneficial alteration in our semantic attitudes 
and behaviour 

In the present work, each statement is merely the best the author 
can make m 1933 Each statement is given definitely, but with the 
semantic limitation that it is based on the information available to the 
author in 1933 The author has spared no labour m endeavouring to 
ascertain the state of knowledge as it exists in the fields from which his 
material is drawn Some of this information may be incorrect, or 
wrongly interpreted. Such errors will come to light and be corrected as 
the j ears proceed 

A great source of difficulty and of possible objections is that science 
is, at present, so specialized that it is impossible for one man to know all 
fields, and that, therefore, the use of a term such as ‘science 1933’, might 
be fundamentally unsound This objection should not be lightly dis- 
missed, as it IS serious. Yet it can, I believe, be answered satisfactorily 
At this early stage of our enquiry, a large number of the facts of knowl- 
edge does not affect my investigation, therefore, it has not proved im-

possible to keep sufficiently well informed on the points which are 
covered Also, the further scientific theories advance, the simpler they 
become For instance, books on physics are simpler and less voluminous 
now than twenty years ago Something similar could be said about 
mathematics The general outlook is simpler 

The main interest of the author at this stage of his work is struc- 
tural and semantic, rather than technical, and so he has only had to know 
enough of the technique of different sciences to be able to understand 
sufficiently their structure and method Revolutionary structural and 
methodological advances are few in the history of mankind , and so it is 
possible, though not easy, to follow them up in 1933 

But the mam point is that the affixing of the date has very far- 
reaching structural methodological and, therefore, psycho-logical seman- 
tic consequences For instance, it changes propositional function into 
propositions, converts semantically one-valued mtensional methods into 
oD-valued extensional methods, introduces four-dimensional methods , 
and so the 'date’ method is to be recommended on these structural and 
semantic grounds alone As it is beneficial to affix the date in 1933, we 
affix the date 1933, not to give the impression that from a technical point 
of view I am familiar with the results of all branches of science at that 
date, but to indicate that no advance m structure and method of 1933 
has been disregarded It will become obvious later in this book, when 
additional data have been taken into consideration, and a new summary 
and new abstractions made, that the result is a surprising simplification, 
which can be clearly understood by laymen as well as by scientists With 
the help of the generalizations of new structure and oo-valiied semantics, 
it will be easier to follow the advance of science, because we shall then 
have a better outlook on the psycho-logics of science as-a-whole 

It will become clear, too, that to provide for a fuither elaboration 
of this work m the future, the establishment of a special branch of 
research m ,^4-systems must become a group activity , for, as I have been 
painfully aware, the production of even this outline of that branch of 
research has overstrained the powers of one man 

The most cheering part of this work is, perhaps, the practical 
results which this investigation has accomplished, combined with the 
simplicity of means emplo 3 'ed One of the dangers into which the reader 
IS liable to fall is to ascribe too much generality to the work, to forget 
the limitations and, perhaps, one-sidedness which underlie it The limita- 
tion and the generality of this tiieory he m the fact that if we symbolize 
our human problems (H = Xi, x^, x^, Xt, Xs, x„) ) as a function of 
an enormous number of \ariables, the present theory deals only with a 



144 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


few of these variables, let us say Xi (say, structure), (say, evalua- 
tion) . , but these variables have been found, up to the present, m all our 
experience and all our equations 

A most important extension of the notion of ‘function’ and ‘propo- 
sitional function’ has been further accomplished by Cassius J Keyser, 
who, m 1913, in his discussion of the multiple interpretations of postu- 
late systems, introduced the notion of the ‘doctrinal function’ Since, 
the doctrinal function has been discussed at length by Keyser m his 
Mathematical Philosophy and his other writings, by CarniichaeF, and 
others Let us recall that a propositional function is defined as an 
00 -valued statement, containing one or more variables, such that when 
single values are assigned to these variables the expression becomes a 
one-valued proposition A manifold of interrelated propositional func- 
tions, usually called postulates, with all the consequences following from 
them, usually called theorems, has been termed by Keyser a doctrinal 
function A doctrinal function, thus, has no specific content, as it deals 
with variables, but establishes definite relations between these variables 
In principle, we can assign many single values to the variable terms and 
so generate many doctrines from one doctrinal function In an oo-valued 
^-system which eliminates identity and is based on structure, doctrinal 
functions become of an extraordinary importance 

In an oo-valued world of absolute individuals on objective levels, 
our statements can always be formulated m a way that makes obvious 
the use of oo-valued terms (variables) and so the postulates can always 
be expressed by propositional function As postulates establish relations 
or multi-dimensional order, a set of postulates which defines a doctrinal 
function gives, also uniquely, the linguistic structure As a rule, the 
builders of doctrines do not start with sets of postulates which would 
explicitly involve variables, but they build their doctrine around some 
specific content or one special respective value for the variables, and so 
the structure of a doctrine, outside of some mathematical disciplines, has 
never been explicitly given If we trace a given doctrine with specific 
content to its doctrinal function without content, but \ariable terms, then, 
only, do we obtain a set of postulates which gives us the linguistic struc- 
ture Briefly, to find the structure of a doctrine, we must formulate the 
doctrinal function of which the given doctrine is only a special inter- 
pretation In non-mathematical disciplines, where doctrines are not 
traced down to a set of postulates, we have no means of knowing their 
structure, or whether two different doctrines originated from one doc- 
trinal function, or from two In other words, we have no simple means 
of ascertaining whether the two different doctrines have similar or differ-

145 


ent structure. Under aristotelianism, these differentiations were impos- 
sible, and so the problems of linguistic structure, propositional and 
doctrinal functions , were neglected, except in the recent work of mathe- 
maticians The entirely general semantic influence of these structural 
conditions becomes obvious when we realize that, no matter whether or 
not our doctrines are traced down to their doctrinal functions, our 
semantic processes and all ‘thinking’ follow automatically and, by neces- 
sity, the conscious or unconscious postulates, assumptions , which are 
given (or made conscious) exclusively by the doctrinal function 

The terms ‘proposition’, ‘function’, ‘propositional function’, ‘doc- 
trinal function’ , are multiordinal, allowing many orders, and, in a given 
analysis, the different orders should be denoted by subscripts to allow 
a differentiation between them When we deal with more complex 
doctrines, we find that in structures they represent higher order doc- 
trines, or a higher whole, the constituents of which represent lower order 
doctrines Similarly, with doctnnal functions, if we take any system, an 
analysis will discover that it is a whole of related doctrinal functions. 
As this situation is the most frequent, and as ‘thinking’, in general, rep- 
resents a process of relating into higher order relational entities which 
are later treated as complex wholes, it is useful to have a term which 
would symbolize doctnnal functions of higher order, which are made 
up of doctnnal functions of lower orders We could preserve the ter- 
minology of ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ order, but as these conditions are 
always found in all systems, it seems more expedient to call the higher 
body of interrelated doctrinal functions, which ultimately produce a 
system — a system-function At present, the term ‘system function’ has 
been already coined by Doctor H M Sheffer’, but, to my knowledge, 
Sheffer uses his ‘system function’ as an equivalent for the ‘doctrinal 
function’ of Keyser For the reasons given above, it seems advisable to 
limit the term ‘doctrinal function’ to the use as introduced by Keyser, 
and to enlarge the meaning of Sheffer’s term ‘system function’ to the 
use suggested in the present work, this natural and wider meaning to 
be indicated by the insertion of a hyphen 

In a /4-system, when we realize that we live, act , in accordance 
with non-el s r, always involving integrated ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’ and, 
therefore, some explicit or implicit postulates w'hich, by structural neces- 
sity, utilize variable, multiordinal and oo-valued terms, we must recognize 
that we live and act by some system-functions which consist of doctrinal 
functions The above issues are not only of an academic interest, as, 
without mastering all the issues emphasized in the present work, it is 
10 



146 STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


impossible to analyse the extremely complex difficulties in which, as a 
matter of fact, we are immersed. 

At present, the doctrinal functions and the sj stem-functions hare 
not been worked out, and even in mathematics, where these notions 
onginated, we speak too little about them. But in mathematics, as the 
general tendency is to bring all mathematical disciplines to a postulational 
base, and these postulates ahiaj-s involve multiordinal and x-valued 
terms, v\e actually produce doctnnal or system-functions, as the case 
may be In this way, we find the structure of a given doctrine or sys- 
tem, and so are able to compare the stnictures of different, and some- 
times verj complex, verbal schemes. Similar structure-finding methods 
must be applied some day to all other, at present, non-mathematical 
disciplines The mam difficulty, in the search for structure, was the 
absence of a clear formulation of the issues involved and the need for 
a .d-svstem, so as to be able to compare fu'o systems, the comparison of 
w’hich helps further structural discoverv' It is not claimed that either 
the A OT A system-functions have been formulated here, but it seems 
that, m the presence or absence of identification, we find a fundamental 
postulate which, once formulated, suggests a comparison with experience 
As we discover that ‘identit>’ is invariably false to facts, this A postu- 
late must be rejected from any future .J-system 

It happens that any new and revolutionary doctrine or sjstem is 
alwaj's based on a new doctrinal or system- function which establishes 
its new structure with a new set of relations Thus, any new doctrine or 
system, when traced to its postulates, allows us to verify and scrutinize 
the initial postulates and to find out if they correspond to experience , 

A few examples will make it clearer Cartesian analvtical geometry 
is based on one sj stem-function, having one sv stem-structure, although 
we may have indefinitely many different cartesian co-ordinates The 
vector and the tensor sv stems also depend on two different sv stem- 
functions, different from the cartesian; they hav’e three different struc- 
tures Intertranslations are possible, but only when the fundamental 
postulates do not conflict Thus, the tensor language gives us invariant 
and intrinsic relations, and these can be translated into the cartesian rela- 
tions It seems certain however, although I am not avv'are that this has 
been done, that the indefiniteh many extnnsic characteristics which we 
can manufacture m the cartesian system, cannot be translated into the 
tensor language, which does not admit extrinsic characteristics 

Similar relations are found between other doctrines and systems, 
once their respective structural charactenstics are discovered b}- the

formulating of their respective functions, which, by the explicit or im- 
plicit postulates, determine their structure. 

Thus all existing schools of psychotherapy, prior to 1933, result 
from one system-function which underlies tmphcitly the system orig- 
inated by Freud * The particular freudian doctrine is only one of the 
indefinitely many variants of similar system-structure, which can be 
manufactured from the one system-function underlying the particular 
freudian system. In other words, it is of no importance what ‘complex’ 
we emphasize or manufacture, the structural principles which underlie 
this new freudian and revolutionary system- function remain unchanged 
From this point of view, all existing schools of psychotherapy could be 
called ‘cartesian’, because, although they all have one general system- 
structure, yet they allow indefinitely many particular variations The 
present .,4-system suggests that the ‘cartesian’ school of psychotherapy is 
still largely A, el and fundamentally of one structure 

The present system involves a different system-function of different 
structure, rejecting identity, discovering the ‘structural unconscious’, 
establishing psychophysiology,. The mutual translatability follows the 
rules of general semantic principles or conditions which apply also to 
mathematics , namely, that a .,4-system, being based on relations . on the 
elimination of identity , on structure , gives us only intrinsic characteris- 
tics and might be called the ‘tensor’ school of psychotherapy This sys- 
tem allows all the intrinsic characteristics discovered, no matter by whom, 
but has no place for the indefinitely many, quite consistent, yet irrele- 
vant metaphysical, extrinsic characteristics, which we can manufacture 
at will. 

Without the realization of the structural foundations emphasized in 
the present system, it is practically impossible not to confuse linguistic 
structural issues, which lead inevitably to semantic blockages When we 
deal with doctrines or systems of different structure, each of which 
involves different doctrinal or system-functions, it is of the utmost 
importance to keep them at first strictly separated, to work out each sys- 
tem by itself, and only after this is accomplished can we carry out an 
independent investigation as to the ways they mutually intertranslate. 
Let me again repeat, that the mixing of different languages of different 
structures is fatal for clear ‘thinking’ Only when a system is traced to 
its system-function, and the many implications worked out in their 
un-mixed form, can we make a further independent investigation of the 
ways m which the different systems intertranslate As a general rule, 
every new scientific system eliminates a great deal of spurious meta- 
physics from the older systems In practice, the issues are extremely 



148 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES . 


simple if one decides to follow the general rule; namely, either com- 
pletely to reject or completely to accept provisionally, at a given date, a 
new sjstem, use exclusively the structurally new terms, perform our 
semantic operations exclusnely in these terms, compare the conclusions 
w ith experience , perform neiv experiments which the structurally new 
terminolog}' suggests , and only then, as an independent enquiry, investi- 
gate how one system translates into the other In those translations, 
which correspond to the transformation of frames of reference in mathe- 
matics, we find the most important invariant characteristics or relations 
which sur\-ive this translation If a characteristic appears in all formu- 
lations, It is a sign that this characteristic is intrinsic, belongs to the 
subject of our analysis, and is not accidental and irrelevant, belonging 
only to the accidental structure of the language we use Once these 
invanant, intrinsic characteristics are discovered, and there is no way to 
discover them except by reformulating the problems m different lan- 
guages (in mathematics we speak about the transformation of frames of 
reference), we then know that we have discovered invariant relations, 
which survive transformation of different forms of representations, and 
so realize that we are dealing with something genuinely important, inde- 
pendent from the structure of the language we use 

History shows that the discovery of isolated, though interesting, 
facts has had less influence on the progress of science than the discov ery 
of new system-functions which produce neiv linguistic structures and 
new methods In our own lifetime, some of the most revolutionary of 
these advances in structural adjustment and method have been accom- 
plished The w'ork of Einstein, the revision of mathematical founda- 
tions, the new quantum mechanics, colloidal science, and advances in 
psychiatry, are perhaps structurally and semantically the most important 
There seems no escape from admitting that no modern man can be 
really intelligent in 1933 if he knows nothing about these structural 
scientific revolutions It is true that, because these advances are so recent, 
they are still represented in very technical terms , their system-functions 
have not been formulated, and so the deeper structural, epistemological 
and semantic simple aspects have not been worked out These aspects are 
of enormous human importance But they must be represented without 
such an abundance of dry technicalities, which are only a means, and not 
an end, in search for structure 

A scientist may be very much up to date in his line of work, let us 
say, in biology, but his physico-mathematical structural knowledge may 
be somewhere in the eighteenth or nineteenth century and his epistem- 
ology, metaph) sics, and structure of language of 300 b c This classifi-

cation by years gives a fairly good picture of his semantic status Indeed, 
we can fortell quite often what kind of reaction such a man will exhibit 

This functional, propositional-function, and system-function struc- 
tural attitude IS in accord with the methods developed by psychiatry In 
psychiatry, ‘mental’ phenomena are considered, in some instances, from 
the point of view of arrested development, in others, as regression to 
older and more primitive levels With this attitude and understanding, 
we cannot ignore this peculiar intermixing of different personalities in 
one man when different aspects of him exhibit jy of different ages and 
epochs of the development of mankind In this connection should be 
mentioned the problem of the multiple personalities which often occur 
in the ‘mentally’ ill Such splitting of personality is invariably a serious 
semantic symptom, and a person who exhibits different ages in his 
semantic development, as, for instance, 1933 in some respects, sixteenth 
century in others, and 300, or even 5000, b c in still others, cannot be a 
well co-ordinated individual If we teach our children, whose nervous 
systems are not physically finished at birth, doctrines structurally belong- 
ing to entirely different epochs of human development, we ought not to 
wonder that semantic harm is done Our efforts should be to co-ordinate 
and integrate the individual, help the nervous system, and not split the 
individual semantically and so disorganize the nervous system 

It IS necessary to remember that the organism works as-a-whole 
In the old days we had a comforting delusion that science was a purely 
‘intellectual’ affair This was an el creed which was structurally false to 
facts It would probably be below the dignity of an older mathematician 
to analyse the ‘emotional’ values of some piece of mathematical work, as, 
for instance, of the ‘propositional function’ But such a mathematician 
probably never heard of psychogalvanic experiments, and how his 
‘emotional curve’ becomes expressive when he is solving some mathemat- 
ical problem 

In 1933, we are not allowed to follow the older, seemingly easier, 
and simpler paths In our discussion, we have tried to analyse the prob- 
lems at hand as oo-valued manifestations of human behaviour We were 
analysing the doings of Smith, Brown , and the semantic components 
which enter into these forms of beliaviour must be especially emphasized, 
emphasized because they were neglected In well-balanced persons, all 
psycho-logical aspects should be represented and should work har- 
moniously In a theory of sanity, this semantic balance and co-ordination 
should be our first aim, and we should, therefore, take particular care 
of the neglected aspects The non-el point of view makes us postulate 
a permanent connection and interdependence between all psycho-logical 



150 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES . 


aspects Most human difficulties, and ‘mental’ ills, are of non-el affective 
origin, extremely difficult to control or regulate by el means Yet, we 
now see that purely technical scientific discoveries, because structural, 
have unsuspected and far-reaching beneficial affective semantic compo- 
nents Perhaps, instead of keeping such discoveries for the few ‘high- 
brows’, who never use them fully, we could introduce them as structural, 
semantic and linguistic devices into elementary schools, with highly bene- 
ficial psycho-logical results There is really no difficulty in explaining 
what has been said here about structure to children and training them 
in appropriate s r The effect of doing so, on sanity, would be profound 
and lasting 



CHAPTER XII 


ON ORDER 


The fundamental importance of the subject of order may be inferred 
from the fact that all the concepts required in geometry can be expressed 
in terms of the concept of order alone (237) e v Huntington 

Dimensions, in geometry, are a development of order The conception 
of a hmtt, which underlies all higher mathematics, is a serial conception 
There are parts of mathematics which do not depend upon the notion of 
order, but they are very few in comparison with the parts in which this 
notion IS involved (4SS) dcrtrand russell 

The notion of continuity depends upon that of order, since continuity is 
merely a particular type of order (4S4) bertrand russell 

Logistic may be defined as the sctence which deals with types of order as 
such 1300) C I LEWIS 

The branch of physics which is called Elementary Geometry was long 
ago delivered into the hands of mathematicians for the purposes of in- 
struction But, while mathematicians are often quite competent in their 
knowledge of the abstract structure of the subject, they are rarely so in 
their grasp of its physical meaning (S29) Oswald veblen 

’ ’ We often think that when we have completed our study of one we know 
all about two, because “two" is "one and one” We forget that we have 
still to make a study of “and". Secondary physics is the study of "and” — 
that is to say, of organisation ( 149 ) A s Eddington 

the geometry of paths can be regarded as a generalization both of 
the earliest part of elementary geometry and of some of the most refined 
of physical theories The study of the projective, the affine and the metric 
geometry of paths ought to result in a comprehensive idea of what types 
of physical theory it is possible to construct along the lines which have 
been successful in the past (529) Oswald veblen 

What I wish to emphasize now is the need of logistic studies which will 
make it possible to say more definitely than is yet possible in this field 
what IS assumed, what is proved, and how the group of theorems and 
definitions hang together (529) Oswald veblen 

Memory, in fact, is nothing but the reinforcement and facilitatmn of 
the passage of the nervous impulse along certain paths (4ii) henri pieron 
But before dealing with the brain, it is well to distinguish a second 
characteristic of nervous organization which renders it an organization in 
levels (411) HENRI PifeRON 

This affective repercussion seems to take place at the penultimate stage 
of the nervous system and governs complicated reflexes or instinctive re- 
actions (411) HENRI PlilRON 

Furthermore, there are even symbols of symbols, evocative of images 

only in the second degree, by means of primary stations of the co-ordination 
centres (4ii) hfnri pieron 

In this way it is seen that the order in which a given group of stimuli 

taking part in a stimulatory compound are arranged, and the pauses be- 
tween them are the factors which determine the final result of the stimu-

lation, and therefore most probably the form of the reaction, and we know 
already that diflereiiL intensities of the same stimulus can be differentiated 
very acirttrately, one definite intensity being connected with excitation and 
another with ^inhibition (394) I P PAVLOV 

Whoever studies Leibniz, Lambert and Castillon cannot fail to be con- 
vinced that a consistent calculus of concepts in intension is either im- 
mensely (lifficult or, as Couturat has said, impossible (300) c i lewis 
The relation between intensions and extensions is unsymmetncal, not 
symmetrical as the medieval logicians would have it (300) c i i.EWis 

The old “law" of formal logic, that if a is contained in in extension, 
then 0 IS contained in <* in intension, and vice versa, is false The connec- 
tion between extension and intension is by no means so simple as that 
(3(X)) C I LEWIS 

I do not suggest explicit confusions of this sort, but only that traditional 
elementary logic, taught in youth, is an almost fatal barrier to clear think- 
ing in later years, unless much time is spent in acquiring a new technique 
(457) BERTRAND RUSSELL 


Section A Undefined terms 

We can now introduce a structural non-el term which underlies not 
only all existing mathematics, but also the present work This bridging 
term has equal importance m science and in our daily life , and applies 
equally to ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ The term in question is ‘order’, in the 
sense of ‘betweenness’ If we say that a, b, and c are in the order a, h, c, 
we mean that b is between a and c, and we say, further, that a, b, c, has 
a different order from c, b, a, or b, a, c. The mam importance of num- 
bers in mathematics is in the fact that they have a definite order In 
mathematics, we are much concerned with the fact that numbers repre- 
sent a definite ordered series or progression, 1, 2, 3, 4, 

In the present system, the term ‘order’ is accepted as undefined It 
IS clear that we cannot define all our terms If we start to define all our 
terms, we must, by necessity, soon come to a set of terms which we 
cannot define any more because we will have no more terms with which 
to define them We see that the structure of any language, mathematical 
or daily, is such that we must start implicitly or explicitly with undefined 
terms. This point is of grave consequence In this work, following 
mathematics, I explicitly start with undefined important terms 

When we use a series of names for objects, ‘Smith, Brown, Jones’ , 
we say nothing We do not produce a proposition But if we say ‘Smith 
kicks Brown’, we have introduced the term ‘kicks’, which is not a name 
for an object, but is a term of an entirely different character Let us 
call it a ‘relation-word’ If we analyse this term, ‘kicks’, further, we will 
find that we can define it by considering the leg (objective) of Smith 
(obj’ective), some part of the anatomy of Brown (obj'ective), and. 



ON ORDER 


153 


finally, Brown (objective) We must use a further set of terms that 
describes how the leg of Smith ‘moves’ through an ‘infinity’ of ‘places’ in 
an ‘infinity’ of ‘instants’ of ‘time’, ‘continuously’ until it reaches Brown. 

When a donkey kicks a donkey, there may be a broken leg, but 
that IS, practically, the only consequence Not so when Smith kicks 
Brown Should Brown happen to be a royal or a business man in Nica- 
ragua or Mexico, this might be considered ‘a mortal oflfense of a great 
sovereign nation to another great sovereign nation', a war might follow 
and many non-royals or non-business men might die When a symbolic 
class of life enters the arena, semantic complications may arise not exist- 
ing with animals 

In the relation terms, the statement, ‘Smith kicks Brown’, has 
introduced still further symbolic complications It involves a full-fledged 
metaphysics, as expressed in the terms ‘moves’, ‘infinity’, ‘space’, ‘time’, 
‘continuity’, and w'hat not It must be emphasized that all human state- 
ments, savage or not, involve a structural metaphysics 

These relational terms should be elucidated to the utmost Until 
lately, the ‘philosophers’, in their ‘Jehovah complex’, usually said to the 
scientists' ‘Hands off, those are superior pioblems with which only we 
chosen ones can deal’ As a matter of history, ‘philosophers’ have not 
produced achievements of any value in the structural line But the ‘mere’ 
scientists, mainly mathematicians and mathematical physicists, have taken 
care of these problems with extremely important structural (1933) 
results In the solutions of these semantic problems, the term ‘order’ 
became paramount 

Perhaps this example of an analysis of the statement, ‘Smith kicks 
Browm’, shows the justice of the contention of this work that no man 
can be ‘intelligent’ if he is not acquainted with these new works and 
their structural elucidations 

We see that no statement made by man, whether savage or civilized, 
IS free from some kind of structural metaphysics involving s r We see 
also that when we explicitly start with undefined words, these undefined 
words have to be taken on faith They represent some kind of implicit 
creed, or metaphysics, or structural assumptions We meet here with a 
tremendously beneficial semantic effect of modern methods, in that w'e 
deliberately state our undefined terms We thus divulge our creeds and 
metaphysics In this way, we do not blind the reader or student We 
invite criticism, elaboration, verification, evaluation , and so accelerate 
progress and make it easier for others to work out issues Compare the 
statement of Newton, ‘Hypotheses non Hugo’ (I do not make hypothe- 
ses), in his Philosophiae Natiirahs Prmcipia Mathematica, when he pro- 



154 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


ceederl to roin some very doubtful hypotheses, and such works as 
produced by Peano, Whitehead, Russell, and others, in which not only all 
assumptions are stated explicitly, but even the assumptions, given in 
single tindehned terms, are listed It is not assumed here that even 
Peano, Whitehead, Russell, and the others have fulfilled this program 
entirely It is quite probable that not all of their assumptions are stated 
explicitly However, a very serious and revolutionary beginning has been 
made m this direction We have still fai to go, for at present even 
mathematicians disregard the threefold relational character of mathe- 
matics, and, by a semantic confusion of orders of abstraction, make 
structurally cl assumptions false to the facts of 1933 , namely, that 
mathematics exists ‘by itself’, detached from the producers. Smith and 
others This procedure reminds one of the old N ‘I do not make 
hypotheses’, proffered just at the moment he begins to legislate about the 
structure of the universe and to postulate his ‘absolute space’ and ‘abso- 
lute time’ ‘without reference to any external object whatsoever’ This, 
of course, was structurally unascertainable, and so was a mere figment of 
his imagination, inside of his skin, and may become a pathological seman- 
tic projection when externalized by affective pressure 

That we must all start with undefined terms, representing blind 
creeds \\ Inch cannot be elucidated further at a given moment, may fill the 
hearts of some metaphysicians with joy ‘Here’, they might say, ‘we 
have the goods on the scientists ; they criticize us and reject our theories, 
and yet they admit that they also must start with blind creeds Now we 
have full justification for assuming whatever we want to ’ But this joy 
would be short-lived for any reasonably sane individual In mathematics, 
we deliberately assume the minimum, and not the maximum, as in meta- 
physics The undefined terms selected for use are the simplest of our 
experience, for instance, ‘order’ (betweenness) Also, in experimental 
sciences, we assume the least possible We demand from a scientific 
theory, according to the standards of 1933, that it should account for all 
relevant facts known in 1933 and should serve as a basis for the predic- 
tion of new facts, which can be checked by new experiments If meta- 
physicians and ‘philosophers’ would comply with such scientific standards, 
their theories would be scientific But their old theories would have to 
be abandoned and their new theories would become branches of science 
Under such structural circumstances, there is no possibility of going 
outside of science, as we can enlarge the bounds of science without 
known limits, in search for structure 

It must be pointed out that no set of undefined terms is ultimate 
A set remains undefined only until some genius points out simpler and

more general or structurally more satisfactory undefined terms, or can 
reduce the number of such terms Which set we accept is determined 
in the main, by pragmatic, practical, and structural reasons Out of two 
systems which have many characteristics of usefulness , in common, we 
would and should select the one which assumes least, is the simplest, 
and carries the furthest Such changes from one set to another, when 
scientific, are usually epoch-making, as exemplified m mathematics 

It IS important to realize that this semantic attitude signalizes a new 
epoch m the development of science In scientific literature of the old 
days, we had a habit of demanding, ‘define your terms’ The new 1933 
standards of science really should be, ‘state your undefined terms’. In 
other w ords, ‘lay on the table your metaphysics, your assumed structure, 
and then only proceed to define your terms in terms of these undefined 
terms’ This has been done completely, or approximately so, only in 
mathematics Yet, probably no one will dem that the new requirements 
of science (1933), no matter how laborious, are really desirable, and 
constitute an ad\ance in method, in accordance with the structure of 
human knowledge 

In the present work, this method will be employed practically all 
through Of course, names for objects may be accepted without enquiry 
So we have already a large vocabularj at our disposal But names alone 
do not give propositions We need relatipn-ivoi ds, and it is here where 
our undefined terms become impoitant Up to this stage of the present 
work, I have accepted, without over-full explanation, the vocabularies 
made by the linguists of exact science, whom we usually call mathema- 
ticians There is an enormous benefit m doing so, because, no matter 
how imperfect the mathematical vocabulary may be, it is an extensive 
and developed linguistic system of similar structure to the world around 
us and to our nervous sjstem 1933 (See Part V ) 

Some of the most important undefined terms which play a marked 
role in this work are ‘order’ (in the sense explained), ‘relation’, and 
‘difference’, although we could define relation in terms of multi- 
dimensional order There is a remarkable structural characteristic of 
these terms , namely, that they are von-el, and that they apply to ‘senses’ 
as well as to ‘mind’ It is, perhaps, well to suggest that, in future works, 
the terms selected should be of the non-el type Since these terms apply 
equally to ‘senses’ and to ‘mind’, we see that in such terms we may 
attempt to give a ‘coherent’ account of what we experience The expres- 
sion ‘coherent’ implies ‘mind’, and ‘experience’ implies ‘senses’ It is 
amusing to watch this peculiar circularity of human knowledge many 
instances of which will appear later on Thus, there was great difficulty 



156 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


in expressing organism-as-a-whole notions, we had to grope about in 
establishing the beginnings of a suitable vocabulary before we could 
approach problems which were antecedent in order 

It is necessary to notice a rather curious structural similarity 
between the N and A systems In both cases, we deal with certain veloci- 
ties about which we know positively that they are finite The velocity of 
light in the iV-system was assumed to be infinite, although we know it 
IS not so, and so ‘simultaneity’ had absolute meaning The N systems 
introduced the finite velocity of light by ordering events, which happens 
to be true to facts, and thus ‘simultaneity’ lost its absolute character 
Likewise in the yf-system and language, the velocity of nervous impulses 
was assumed to he infinite, to spread ‘instantaneously’ And so we had 
most perplexing ‘philosophical’ rigmaroles about ‘emotions’, ‘intellect’ , 
taken as independent separate entities When we introduce explicitly the 
finite velocit}' of nervous impulses (on the average, 120 metres per sec- 
ond in the human nerves), we are able to reach a perfectly clear under- 
standing, 1)1 terms of order, of the spread of impulses Some ‘infinite 
veloatj' does not involve order Conversely, by considering the order 
of events, we introduce finite velocities We shall see later that ‘infinite 
velocity’ IS meaningless and so all actual happenings can be ordered The 
above is an important factor in our .rr 

Let us give a rough example Assume that Smith has had a bad 
dinner Some nervous impulse, originating from the bad dinner, starts 
going At this stage, we may call it an ‘undifferentiated’ nervous impulse 
It travels with finite velocity, reaches the brain-stem and the approxi- 
mately central part of his brain, which ive call the thalamus , is affected 
by them and is no longer ‘undifferentiated’ but becomes, let us say, 
‘affective’ In the cortex, it is affected again by the lessons of past 
experiences It returns again to the lower centres and becomes, let us 
say, ‘emotion’ , and then anything might happen, from sudden death to a 
glorious poem 

The reader must be warned that this example is rough and over- 
simplified Impulses are reinforced and ‘inhibited’ from a complex chain 
of nervous interconnections But what I wish to show by this example, 
IS that, by accepting the finite velocity of nerve currents, m terms of 
order, we can build up a definite vocabulary to deal, not only with the 
‘orgamsm-as-a-whole’, but also with the different stages of the process 
This is important because, without some such ordinal scheme, it is 
structurally impossible to evade enormous verbal and semantic difficul- 
ties which lead to great confusion

In the analysis of the above example, only the structural and 
methodological aspects are emphasized No attempt is made to legislate 
for neurologists or to instruct them how they should define and use 
their terms 

Section B Order and the nervous system 

We know that, structurally, not all parts of the nervous system are 
of equal phylogenetic age The ventral part of the brain, the thalamus 
(m the rough), which is of most interest in this connection, is older 
than the cerebral cortex By the term ‘thalamus’ I denote all the sub- 
divisions and most important appendages which we need not mention 
by their technical names In man, both the thalamus and the cerebral 
cortex are much enlarged and have a complex structural cyclic inter- 
connection The cerebral cortex is a term applied to a superficial layer 
of grey nervous tissue covering the cerebral hemispheres It is called 
the ‘new brain’ by Edinger The higher correlation centres m the cere- 
bral hemispheres can act only through the agency of the lower centres, 
the brain-stem, and the thalamus In other words, the cerebral cortex, 
the functioning of which is connected chiefly with the higher associa- 
tions, IS of such structure that no nervous impulse can enter it without 
first passing through the lower centres of the ventral parts of the brain 
and brain-stem 

In the lower vertebrates, which lack the cerebral cortex, the sub- 
cortical mechanisms are adequate for all simple exigencies of life and 
simple association processes, these sub-cortical mechanisms being older 
phylogenetically than the cerebral cortex, yet younger than some still 
more ventral parts 

The brush-like connections between the nerves are called synapses, 
and although a nerve-fibre seems to be capable of transmitting nerve 
impulses in both directions, the nervous impulse can seemingly pass 
the synapse in only one direction, so a nervous polarity is established 
whenever synapses are present ^

*I quote here from the Second Edition of the Introduction to Neurology an 
account of the classical theory of reflex circuits which is quite satisfactory for my 
purpose In his later work (see my bibliography), Professor Herrick forcibly 
points out the limitations of the reflex theories as partial patterns, as opposed to the 
activity of the organism-as-a-whole In the Fifth Edition (1931), the chapter on 
reflex circuits has been entirely rewritten, and the non-el attitude is expressed very 
clearly I am much indebted to Professor Herrick for drawing my attention to 
this rewritten chapter

‘The structure of the simple reflex circuit is diagrammatically illus- 
trated in Fig 1, A The receptor (i?) may be a simple terminal expansion 
of the sensory nerve-fiber or a very complex sense organ The effec- 
tor (£) may be a muscle or a gland The cell body of the afferent neuron 
(1) may he within the center (C) or outside, as in the diagram A 
simple reflex act involving the use of so elementary a mechanism as has 
just been described is probably never performed by an adult vertebrate. 
The nervous impulse somewhere in its course always comes into rela- 
tion with other reflex paths, and in this way complications in the 
response are introduced 

‘Separate reflex circuits may be so compounded as to give the 
so-called chain reflex (Fig 1, B) Here the response of the first reflex 
serves as the stimulus for the second, and so on in series The units of

these chain reflexes are usually not simple reflexes as diagrammed, but 
complex elements of the types next to be described . The chain reflex 
IS a very common and a very important type Most of the ordinary 
acts in the routine of daily life employ it in one form or another, the 
completion of one stage of the process serving as the stimulus for the 
tmtiation of the next. . 

‘Figure 1, C illustrates another method of compounding reflexes so 
that the stimulation of a single sense organ may excite either or both 
of two responses If the two effectors, £1 and £2, can cooperate m the 
performance of an adaptive response, the case is similar to that of 
Fig 1, A, with the possibility of a more complex type of reaction This 
IS an allied reflex. If, however, the two effectors produce antagonistic 
movements, so that both cannot act at the same time, the result is a 
physiological dilemma Either no reaction at all results, or there is a 
sort of physiological resolution (sometimes called physiological choice), 
one motor pathway being taken to the exclusion of the other. Which 
path will be chosen in a given case may be determined by the physio- 
logical state of the organs If, for instance, one motor system, £2, is 
greatly fatigued and the other rested, the threshold of £2 will be raised 
and the motor discharge will pass to £1 

‘Figure 1, D illustrates the converse case, where two receptors 
discharge into a single center, which, in turn, by means of a final com- 
mon path (£C£) excites a single effector (£) If the two receptors 
upon stimulation normally call forth the same response, they will 
reinforce each other if simultaneously stimulated, the response will be 
strengthened, and we have another type of allied reflex But there are 
cases in which the stimulation of £1 and R2 (Fig 1, D) would naturally 
call forth antagonistic reflexes Here, if they are simultaneously stimu- 
lated, a physiological dilemma will again arise which can be resolved 
only by one or the other afferent system getting contiol of the final 
common path 

‘Figure 1, E illustrates still another form of combination of 
reflexes Here there are connecting tracts A) between the two cen- 
ters so arranged that stimulation of either of the two receptors 
(£1 and £2) may call forth a response in either one of two effectors 
(£1 and £2) These respon-jes may be allied or antagonistic, and much 
more complicated reflexes are here possible than m any of the preceding 
cases . . 

‘It must be kept in mind that m higher vertebrates all parts of the 
nervous system are bound together by connecting tracts (internuncial 
pathways) . These manifold connections are so elaborate that every 



160 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


part of the nervous sjstem is in nervous connection with every other 
part, directly or indirectly This is illustrated by the way in which the 
digestive functions (which normally are quite autonomous, the nervous 
control not going beyond the sympathetic system, ) may be dis- 
turbed by mental processes whose primary seat may be in the association 
centers of the cerebral cortex, and also by the way in which strychnin- 
poisoning seems to lower the neural resistance everywhere, so that a very 
slight stimulus may serve to throw the w'hole body into com ulsions . 

‘Our picture of the reflex act in a higher animal will, then, include 
a view of the whole nervous system in a state of neural tension The 
stimulus disturbs the equilibrium at a definite point (the receptor), and 
the w'ave of nervous discharge thus set up irradiates through the complex 
lines determined by the neural connections of the receptor. If the stimu- 
lus is weak and the reflex path is simple and well insulated, a simple 
response may follow immediately Under other conditions the nervous 
discharge may be inhibited before it reaches any effector, or it may 
irradiate widely, producing a very complex reflex pattern . . . 

‘The mechanism of the reflex should not be regarded as an open 
channel through which energy admitted at the receptive end-organ is 
transmitted to be discharged into the effector organ It is rather a 
complex apparatus, containing reserves of potential energy which can be 
released upon the application of an adequate stimulus in accordance with 
a pattern determined by the inherent structure of the apparatus itself 
In other words, the nervous discharge [italics of Professor Herrick] is 
not a mere transmission of the energy of the stimulus, but it implies 
active consumption of material and release of energy {metabolism) 
within both the nerve centers and the nerve-fibers The energy acting 
upon the effector organ may, therefore, be different in both kind and 
amount from that applied to the receptive end-organ The response 
likewise involves the liberation of the latent energy of the effector 
{muscle or gland), the nervous impulse serving merely to release the 
trigger which discharges this reserve energy ’ 

It IS necessary to warn the reader that the human nervous system is 
structurally of inconceivable complexity It is estimated that there are in 
the human brain about twelve thousand millions of nerve cells or neu- 
rons, and more than half of these are in the cerebral cortex. Most prob- 
ably, the majority of the neurons of the cerebral cortex are directly or 
indirectly connected with every cortical field Were we to consider a mil- 
lion cortical nerve cells connected one with another in groups of only 
two neurons each, and compute the possible combinations, we would find 
the number of possible interneuronic connection-patterns to be repre-

sented by 10®^®^'““'’ What such a number is like is hardly possible 
to imagine For comparison, it may be said that probably the whole 
visible sidereal universe does not contain more than 10““ atoms!* 

Our present knowledge of the nervous sjstem is limited as regards 
its complexities and possibilities, but we know many structural facts 
which seem to be well established One of these is that the human 
nervous system is more complex than that of any animal Another is 
that the human cortex is of later origin than, and in a w ay an outgrowth 
from, the more central parts of the brain (w'hich establishes a structure 
of lezcls) A third is that the interconnection of the parts of the ner- 
vous s>stem IS cyclic A fourth is that the velocity of nerse currents is 
finite The last fact is of serious structural importance, and as a rule, 
disregarded 

Section C Structure, relations, and multi-dimensional order. 

In such an ordered cjclic chain, the nerve impulses reach and tra- 
verse the different levels with finite velocity and so in each case, in a 
definite order ‘Intelligence’ becomes a manifestation of life of the 
orgamsm-as-a-whole, structurally impossible in some fictitious ‘isolation’. 
To ‘be’ means to he related To be related iniohes multi-dimensional 
order and results in structure 

‘Survival’, ‘adaptation’, ‘response’, ‘habit formation’, ‘orientation’, 
‘learning’, ‘selection’, ‘e\aluation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘semantic reactions’, and 
all similar terms involve structurally an ordered, interrelated structural 
complex in which and by which we live and function To ‘comprehend’, 
to ‘understand', to ‘know’, to be ‘intelligent’ , in the pre-human as w'ell as 
the human waj, means the most useful survival adjustment to such an 
ordered, interrelated structure as the world and ourselves 

In this vocabulary, ‘structure' is the highest abstraction, as it involves 
a whole, taken as-a-whole, made up of interrelated parts the relations of 
which can be defined in still simpler terms of order ‘Knowing’, in its 
broadest as w'ell as in its narrow human sense, is conditioned by struc- 
ture, and so consists of structural knowings. All empirical structures 
involve relations, and the last depend on multi-dimensional order. A 
language of order, therefore, is the simplest form of language, yet in 
structure it is similar to the structure of the world and ourselves. Such 
a language is bound to be useful for adaptation and, therefore, sanity ; it 
results in the understanding of the structural, relational, multi-dimen- 
sional order in the environment on all levels 

We must stress the structural fact that the introduction of order as 
a fundamental term abolishes some fanciful and semantically very harm- 

11 



162 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


ful ‘infinities’ If an impulse could tra\el in ‘no time’ or with ‘infinite 
velocity’, which is a structural impossibility in this world, such an impulse 
would reach different places ‘instantaneously’, and so there would be no 
order involved. But, as soon as the actual order in which impulses reach 
their destination is found, ‘infinite velocities' are abolished We shall 
show later that ‘infinite velocity’ is a meaningless noise , here we stress 
only the point that it is a structural impossibilitj'-, as structure involves 
relations and orders, and order could not exist in a world where ‘infinite 
velocities’ were possible 

Conversely, if in our analysis we disregard order, we are bound to 
disregard relations and structure and to introduce, by necessity, some 
fanciful ‘infinite velocities’ Any one who treats ‘mind’ in ‘isolation’ 
makes a structurally false assumption, and, by necessity, unconsciously 
ascribes some meaningless ‘infinite velocity’ to the nerve currents 

We have dwelt upon this subject at such length because of its gen- 
eral structural and semantic importance The first step towards under- 
standing the theory of Einstein is to be entirely convinced on the above 
points Newton’s disregard of order introduced an unconscious false to 
facts assumption of the ‘infinite velocity’ of light, which fatalistically 
leads to an objectification called ‘absolute time’, ‘absolute simultaneity’, 
and so introduces a terminology of inappropriate structure A similar 
remark applies to arguments about ‘mind’ in an objectified ‘isolated’ way 
These arguments disregard the order in which the nervous impulses 
spread and so, by necessity, introduce a silent false to facts assumption 
of the 'infinite velocity’ of nerve currents 

On empirical structural grounds, we know neurological and general 
facts on two levels ( 1 ) Macroscopically, we have a structure in levels, 
stratified, so to say, with complexities arising from the general colloidal 
physico-chemical structure of the organism-as-a-whole (2) The general 
sub-microscopic, atomic, and sub-atomic structure of all materials simply 
gives us the persistence of the macroscopic characteristics as the relative 
invariance of function, due to dynamic equilibrium, and ultimately 
reflected and conditioned by this sub-microscopic structure of all mate- 
rials Under such actual structural conditions, terms like ‘substance’, 
‘material’ , and ‘function’, ‘energy’, ‘action’ , become interconnected — 
largely a problem of preference or necessity of selecting the level with 
which we want to deal 

On sub-microscopic levels, ‘iron’, or anything else, means only a 
persistence for a limited ‘time’ of certain gross characteristics, represent- 
ing a process (structurally a four-dimensional notion involving ‘time’), 
which becomes a question of structure. With the 1933 known unit of 



ON ORDER 


163 


the world called an ‘electron’, which appears as an 'energy’ factor, the 
relative persistence or invariance of dynamic sub-microscopic structure 
gives us, on macroscopic levels, an average, or statistical, persistence of 
gross macroscopic characteristics, which we label ‘iron’. 

The above should be thoroughly understood and digested As a rule, 
we all identify orders and levels of abstractions and so have difficulty in 
keeping them separate verbally (and, therefore, ‘conceptually’) Thor- 
ough structural understanding helps us greatly to acquire these new and 
beneficial r r 

Under such structural empirical conditions, a language of order, 
which implies relations and structure, as enlarged to the order of abstrac- 
tions or level of consideration, largely volitional, becomes the only 
language which, in structure, is similar to the structure of the world, 
ourselves included, and so, of necessity, will afford the maximum of 
semantic benefits 

It should be understood that, on structural grounds, terms like 
‘substance’ and ‘function’ become, in 1933, perfectly interchangeable, 
depending on the order of abstraction ‘Substance’, for instance, on the 
macroscopic level becomes ‘invariance of function’ on the sub-microscopic 
level It follows that what we know about the macroscopic (‘anatomical’) 
structure can be quite legitimatel> enlarged by what we know of function 
(structure on different levels) This interchangeability and complemen- 
tary value of evidence is conditioned by stiuctural considerations, and 
the fact that ‘structure’ is multiordinal On gross anatomical grounds, 
we know a great deal about this structure of the nervous system Because 
of experimental difficulties, very little is known of the structural sub- 
microscopic happenings, yet we can speak about them with benefit in 
functional terms , as, for instance, of ‘activation’, ‘facilitation’, ‘resistance’, 
‘psychogenetic effects’, ‘diffusion’, ‘permeability’, the older ‘inhibition’. 

In such a cyclic chain as the nervous system, there is, as far as 
energy is concerned, no last stage of the process If there is no motor 
reaction or other reflex, then there is a semantic or associative reaction 
with ‘inhibitory’ or activating consequences, which are functionally 
equivalent to a motor reaction At each stage, a ‘terminal’ receptor is a 
reacting organ in the chain ® 

We know quite well from psjxhiatry how nervous energy may 
deviate from constructive and useful channels into destructive and harm- 
ful channels The energy is not lost, but misdirected or misapplied For 
instance, an ‘emotional’ shock may make some people release their 
energy into useful channels, such as concentrated efforts in some direc- 
tion, which would have been impossible without this shock ; but, in 



164 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


others, an ‘emotional’ shock leads to the building up of morbid ‘mental’ 
or physical symptoms. 

Since the nervous structure is cyclic in most of its parts, as well as 
as-a-ivhole, and since these c} cles are directly or indirectly interconnected, 
mutual interaction of those cycles may produce most elaborate behaviour 
patterns, which may be spoken of, in their manifestations, in terms of 
order As each more important neire centre has incoming and outgoing 
nerve-fibres, the activation, or reinforcement, or diffusion of nen'e cur- 
rents may sometimes manifest itself in our j r as reversal of order in 
some aspects Neurologically, considered on the sub-microscopic level, 
it would only be a case of activation, or of diffusion, or of ‘inhibition’ , 
probably never a problem of reversed order m the actual neiwe currents 

The semantic manifestations of order and reversed order are of 
crucial importance, for we are able to tram the individual to different 
orders or reversals of orders This procedure neurologically imolves 
activations, enforcements, diffusions, ‘inhibitions’, resistances, and all 
the other types of nervous activities, which without the formulation of 
psychophysiology were all most inaccessible to direct training The 
structural fact that order and reversal of order in semantic manifesta- 
tion, which all are on the un-speakable objective level, have such intimate 
and profound connection with fundamental nervous processes, such as 
activation, enforcement, diffusion, permeability, ‘inhibition’, resistance , 
gives us tremendous new pow ers of an educational character in building 
up sanity, and supplies methods and means to affect, direct and train 
neiwous activities and sr, which w'e w'ere not able formerly to tram 
psychoph} siologically Perhaps one of the mam values of the present 
work IS the discovery of physiological means, to be given presently, for 
training the human nervous system in ‘sanity’. 

The reader should be aw’are, when we speak of order and reversal 
of order, that we mean the order and re\ersal of order in the un-speak- 
able sr, but the neurological mechanism is of a different character, as 
already explained Our analysis of the simple semantic manifestations 
involve evaluation and so order, permitting a most complex re-education 
and re-trammg of the neivous system, which w^ere entirely beyond our 
reach with the older methods 

Experimental evidence seems to corroborate what has been sug- 
gested here, and the anahsis. in terms of order, seems to ha\e serious 
practical neurological significance, ow’ing to similarity of structure, 
resulting m evaluation, and so appropriate r r 

For our analysis in terms of order, we start with the simplest imag- 
inable nervous cycle , but it must be explicitly understood that such simple 



ON ORDER 


165 


cycles actually never exist, and that our diagrams have value only as 
picturing the cyclic order, without complications Let us repeat that the 
introduction of an analysis in terms of order or reversal of order in the 
mamfestaHon involves, under educational influence, various other and 
different actual nervous actimhes, a class of activities which hitherto 
have always evaded our educational influences For structural purpose, 
it IS sufficient to make use of the distinction between lower and higher 
centres (a rough and ready distinction) and to consider the lower centres 
generally in connection with the thalamus and brain-stem (perhaps also 
other sub-cortical layers), and the higher centres generally in connection 
with the cortex This lack of precision is intentional, for we need only 
sufficient structural stratification to illustrate order, and it seems advis- 
able to assume only the well-established minimum of structure 

We have already mentioned the absolute individuality of the organ- 
ism and, as a matter of fact, of everything else on objective le^els The 
reader need have no metaphysical shivers about such extreme individual- 
ity on the un-speakable levels In our human economy, we need both 
similarities and differences, but we have as yet, m our yi-system, chiefly 
concentrated our attention and training on similarities, disregarding dif- 
ferences In this work, we start structurally closer to nature with 
un-speakable levels, and make differences fundamental, similarities 
appearing only at a later stage (order) as a result of higher abstractions 
In simple words, we obtain similarities by disregarding differences, by 
a process of abstracting In a world of only absolute differences, with- 
out similarities, recognition, and, therefore, 'intelligence’, would be 
impossible 

It is possible to demonstrate how ‘intelligence’ and abstracting both 
started together and are due to the phjsico-chemical structure of proto- 
plasm All living material, usually called protoplasm, has, in some 
degree, the nervous functions of irritability, conductivity, integration , 
It is obvious that a stimulus 5" does not affect the little piece of primitive 
protoplasm A ‘all over and at once’ (infinite velocity), but that it affects 
it first in a definite spot B, that the wave of excitation spreads, with 
finite velocity and usually m a diminishing gradient, to the more remote 
portions of A We notice also that the effect of the stimulus 5 on -^4 is 
not identical with the stimulus itself A falling stone is not identical 
with the pain we feel when the stone falls on our foot Neither do our 
feelings furnish a full report as to the characteristics of the stone, its 
internal structure, chemistry , . So we see that the bit of protoplasm is 
affected only partially, and in a specific way, by the stimulus Under 
physico-chemical conditions, as they exist in life, there is no place for any 



166 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


'allness' In life, we deal structurally only with ‘non-allness’ , and so the 
term, ‘abstracting in different orders’, seems to be structural!)' and 
uniquely appropriate for describing the effects of external stimuli on 
living protoplasm ‘Intelligence’ of any kind is connected with the 
abstracting (non-allness) which is characteristic of all protoplasmic 
response Similarities are perceived only as differences become blurred, 
and, therefore, the process is one of abstracting 

The important novelty in my treatment is in the structural fact that 
I treat the term ‘abstracting’ in the non-el \\ ay We find that all In ing 
protoplasm ‘abstracts’ So I make the term abstracting fundamental, and 
I give It a wide range of meanings to correspond to the facts of life by 
introducing abstractions of different orders Such a treatment has great 
structural adi antages, which \\ ill be explained in Part \TI 

As our mam interest is in ‘Smitb„’, we will speak mostly of him, 
although the language we use is structurally appropriate for character- 
izing all life ‘Abstracting’ becomes now a physiological term with struc- 
tural, actional, physico-chemical, and non-el implications 

Accidentally, some light is thus thrown on the problem of 'e\olution’ 
In actual objective life, each new cell is different from its parent cell, and 
each offspring is different from its parents Similarities appear only as 
a result of the action of our neiwous s}stem, which does not register 
absolute differences Therefore, we register similarities, which evaporate 
when our means of investigation become more subtle Similarities are 
read into nature by our nervous system, and so are stiucturally less 
fundamental than differences Less fundamental, but no less important, 
as life and ‘intelligence’ w ould be totally impossible without abstracting 
It becomes clear that the problem which has so excited the jr of the 
people of the United States of America and added so much to the merri- 
ment of mankind, ‘Is evolution a “fact” or a “theorj ” is simply silly 
Father and son are never identical — ^that surely is a structural ‘fact’ — so 
there is no need to worry about still higher abstractions, like ‘man’ and 
‘monkey’ That the fanatical and ignorant attack on the theory of evolu- 
tion should have occurred may be pathetic, but need concern us little, as 
such Ignorant attacks are always liable to occur But that biologists 
should offer ‘defences’, based on the confusion of orders of abstractions, 
and that ‘philosophers’ should have failed to see this simple dependence 
IS rather sad The problems of ‘evolution’ are verbal and have nothing to 
do with life as such, which is made up all through of different individ- 
uals, ‘similarity’ being structurally a manufactured article, produced by 
the nervous system of the observer

167 


In my own practice, I have become painfully aware of a similar 
discrepancy in the learned j r of some older professors of biology, who 
quite often try to inform me that ‘Life is overlapping’, and that ‘no sharp 
distinction between “man” and “animal” can be made’ They forget 
or do not know that, structurally, actual ‘life’ is composed of absolute 
individuals, each one unique and different from all other individuals 
Each individual should have its individual name, based on mathematical 
extensional methods , for instance, .Vi, ,v„ , of Smithi, Sniitha , 

or Fidoi, Fidoa , ‘Man’ and ‘animal’ are only labels for verbal fictions 
and are not labels for an actual living individual It is obvious that as 
these verbal fictions, ‘man’ and ‘animal’, are not the li\ing indiiidual, 
their ‘overlapping’ or ‘not overlapping’ depends only on our iiigeniitty, 
our power of observation and abstraction, and our capacity of coming 
non-el functional definitions 

Let us see how adaption might work in practice Let us consider 
two or three caterpillars, which we may name Ci, C2, C3, since each of 
them is an absolute individual and different from the others Let us 
assume that Ci is positively heliotropic, which means that he is compelled 
to go toward light, that Ca is negatively heliotropic, which means that 
he would tend to go away from light, and that Cs is non-heliotropic, 
which means that light would have no effect on him of a directional char- 
acter At a certain age, Ci would crawl up the tree near which he was 
born and so reach the leaves, eat them, and, after eating them, would be 
able to complete his development C2, and probably C3, wmuld die, as 
they would not crawl up the tree toward sufficient food Thus, w'e see 
that among the indefinite number of possible individual make-ups of C* 
(fe = 1, 2, 3, . 11 ), each one being different, only those which were 

positively heliotropic would survive under the conditions of this earth, 
and all the rest would die The positively heliotropic wmuld propagate 
and their positive hehotropism might be perpetuated, the negatively 
heliotropic and non-heliotropic becoming extinct This would only occur, 
however, in a world m which trees have roots m the ground and leaves 
on their parts tow'ard the sun In a w'orld where the trees grew with their 
roots tow'ard the sun and leaves in the ground, the reverse would hap- 
pen, namely, the negativel)' heliotropic and non-hehotropic would sur- 
viie, and the posituely heliotropic would die out We can not foretell 
whether, in such a world, there w'ould be caterpillars, so this is an 
hypothetical example 

Experiments made wuth such caterpillars have shown that the posi- 
tively heliotropic ones crawl toward the sun, even upon a plant which 
has been turned over, with the roots tow ard the sun They crawl away 



168 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 

from food, and die We see that the external environmental conditions 
determine which characteristics survive, and so we reach the notion of 
adjustment 

The practical result of these conditions is that the indefinite number 
of individual variations, although they undoubtedly exist, seldom come 
to our attention, as those variations which do not fit their environmental 
conditions become extinct , their variations do not become hereditary, and 
consequently we can seldom find them outside of a laboratory 

This shows, also, the permanent connection and interdependence 
of the facts of nature The structural fact that our trees grow with their 
roots m the ground and their leaves upward is not an independent fact , 
It has something to do with the structure of the world and the position 
and the effect of the sun , So the fact that we ha\ e positively heliotropic 
caterpillars of a special kind, and not negatively heliotropic ones, has 
something to do with the structure of the rest of the world 

To illustrate this interconnection and interdependence of nature still 
more clearly, let me suggest an hypothetical question How would condi- 
tions, as they are on this earth, compare with those which would obtain, 
if It were, let us say, one mile greater in diameter ? Some try to guess 
the answer , yet this question cannot be answered at all The diameter of 
this earth is strictly dependent on all the structural conditions tvhich pre- 
vail in this world Since it is impossible to know what kind of a universe 
it would be, in which this earth could be different from what we know', 
it IS, of course, equally impossible to foresee whether on such a fictitious 
earth, in such a fictitious universe, there would even be life at all 
Because the structure of the world is such as w'e know it, our sun, our 
earth, our trees, our caterpillars, and, finally, ourselves have their struc- 
ture and characteristics, W e do not need to enter here into the problems 
of determinism versus indeterminism, as these problems are purely verbal, 
depending on our orders of abstractions, the ‘logic’ we accept, and so, 
finally, on our pleasure, as is explained more in detail later on, and could 
not be solved satisfactorily in an A, el system, with its two-valued ‘logic’ 

According to the evidence at hand in 1933, ‘Smith„’ appears among 
the latest inhabitants of this earth, and subject to the general test of 
survival, as already explained The few thousand years during w'hich 
there had been any ‘Smith„’ are too short a period to test, with any certi- 
tude, his capacity for survival We know of many species of animals, 
and also races of man, of which very little trace has been left. What w'e 
know about their history is mostly through a few fossils, which are kept 
in museums.

The external world is full of devastating energies and of stimuli too 
strong for some organisms to endure We know that only those organ- 
isms have survived which could successfully either protect themselves 
from over-stimulations or else were under protective circumstances If 
we look over the series of surviving individuals, paying special attention 
to the higher animals and man, we find that the nervous system has, 
besides the task of conducting excitation , the task of so-called ‘inhibi- 
tion’ Response to stimuli, by survival, proved its usefulness But to 
dimmish the response to some stimuli or avoid stimuli, proved also to be 
useful, again by survival It is known that the upper or latest layers of 
the nervous system are mostly such protective layers, to preient imme- 
diate responses to-ishmulation With the development of the nervous 
system from the simplest to the most complex, we see an increase in 
behaviour of a modifiable or individually adjustable type In terms of 
order, and using the old language, ‘senses’ came first in older and ‘mind’ 
next, in all their forms and degrees 

If we speak in neurological terms, we may say that the present 
nervous structure is such that the entering nerve currents have a natural 
direction, established by survival, namely, they traverse the brain-stem 
and the thalamus first, the sub-cortical layers next, then the cerebral 
cortex, and return, transformed, by various paths Experience and 
science in 1933 are shoiving that this is the order established under a 
heavy toll of destruction and non-sur\ival in a system of adjustment, and 
so should be considered the ‘natural’ order, because of its survival value 

We all know in practice about a ‘sensation’, and a ‘mental picture’ 
or ‘idea’ As ‘sensations’ were often very deceptive and, therefore, did 
not always lead to survnal, a nervous system which somehow retained 
vestiges, or ‘memories’, of former ‘sensations’ and could recombine 
them, shift them , proved of higher survival value, and so ‘intelligence’ 
evolved, from the lowest to the highest degrees 

Experience and experiments show that the natural order was ‘sensa- 
tion’ first, ‘idea’ next , the ‘sensation’ being an abstraction of some order, 
and the ‘idea’ already an abstraction from an abstraction or an abstrac- 
tion of higher order 

Experience shows again that among lumiatis, this order m manifes- 
tations IS sometimes reversed, namel}’-, that some individuals have ‘idea’ 
first , namely, some vestiges of memories, and ‘sensations’ next, without 
any external reason for the ‘sensations’ Such individuals are considered 
‘mentally’ ill , in legal terms, they are called ‘insane’ They ‘see’, where 
I there is nothing to see , they ‘hear’, where there is nothing to hear , they 
are paralysed, where there is no reason to be paralysed , they have pains. 



170 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


when there is no reason to have pains, and so on, endlessly Their sur- 
vival value, if not taken care of, is usually nil This reversal of order, 
but in a mild degree, is extremely common at present among all of us 
and underlies mainly all human misfortunes and un-sanity 

This reversal of order in its mild form is involved in identification 
or the confusion of orders of abstractions , namely, when we act as if an 
‘idea’ were an ‘experience’ of our ‘senses’, thus duplicating in a mild 
form the mechanism of the ‘mentally’ ill This implies nervous disturb- 
ances, since we violate the natural (survival) order of the activities of the 
nervous system ^The mechanism of projection is also connected with 
this reversal of order This reversal transforms the external world into 
a quite different and fictitious entityy Both ignorance and the old meta- 
physics tend to produce these undesirable nervous effects of reversed 
order and so non-survival evaluation If we use the nervous system in a 
way which is against its survival structure, we must expect non-survival 
Human history is short, but already we have astonishing records of 
extinction 

That such reversal of older m the manifestations of the functioning 
of the nervous system must be extremely harmful, becomes evident when 
we consider that in such a case the upper layers of our nervous system 
(the cortex) not only do not protect us from over-stimulation originat- 
ing in the external world and inside us, but actually contribute to the 
over-stimulation by producing fanciful, yet very real, irritants Experi- 
ments on some patients have shown how they benefit physically when 
their internal energy is liberated from fighting phantoms and so can be 
redirected to fight the colloidal disturbances Such examples could be 
cited endlessly from practically every field of medicine and life This 
problem of ‘reversal of order’ is not only very important semantically, 
but also very complex, and it will be analysed further on 

The reader should not miss the fact that an analysis in terms of 
order throws a new light on old problems, and so the scientific benefit of 
the use of such a term is shown But this is not all ; the use of the term 
order has brought us to the point where we can see far-reaching prac- 
tical applications of the knowledge we already possess, and of wdiich we 
have not so far made any systematic use 

We know that the activity of the nervous system is facilitated by 
repetition, and we can learn useful habits as easily as harmful In the 
special case of r r also ive can tram ourselves either w'ay, though one may 
have useful survnal value, the other being harmful, with no survival 
value The problem is again one of order, and, among others, a problem 
of extension and intension, as has already been mentioned several times

Section D Order and the problems of extension and intension. 

The problems of extension and intension are not new, but ha\ e been 
treated as yet only casually by ‘philosophers’, ‘logicians’, and mathema- 
ticians, and it has not been suspected what profound, far-reaching, and 
important structural ps) cho-logical, semantic components they represent 

At this point, to avoid confusion, a warning is necessar) The 
problems w ith which we are dealing have ne\ er been anah sed from the 
point of view of this work , namely, from that of structure So, naturally, 
all that has been accomplished m these fields is oi'cr-simpMed, and 
leaves out vital characteristics Discrepancies have arisen between the 
structure of the old verbiage and that of the new Before it is possible 
to formulate the general theory of this work, it will be necessary to go 
ahead m spite of discrepancies, and then to formulate the general theory 
and show how these discrepancies had a perfectly general origin in the 
stratified — and, therefore, ordered — structure of human knowledge The 
discrepancies were inherent and unavoidable in the old way, but are 
avoidable in the new It is the main aim of the present theory to eluci- 
date structural issues in connection with sr and many problems of 
human and scientific conduct, mathematics and insanity included, and, in 
general, with all known problems of scientific method and theory of 
knowledge But we ought not to be surprised if such a pioneering 
enquiry proves to need many corrections and elaborations in the future 
Psychiatrists are the least likely to disregard the problems of structure 
and s r, since their science is young and still flexible Besides, the psychia- 
trists know' a great deal about ‘human nature’ and behaviour, though they 
are handicapped by insufficient knowledge of the exact sciences and the 
absence of A, non-el semantics The opposite, perhaps, w'ould be true 
about mathematicians They know' a great deal about how' to play with 
symbols Their work is engrossing and exacting But very few' are 
capable of separating themselves enough from this play to contemplate 
the broader, more ‘human’, aspects of their own science, the interplay 
of sjmbols in language, their structure, and the bearing of structure on 
j r and adaptation 

Some of these specialists might say that the author uses their terms 
in a sense different from that m which they use them, and that, conse- 
quently, from their point of view', this work is not strictly legitimate. 
[However, when a mathematician lajs down a definition, such as 1-|-1=2, 
this has nothing to do with the application we make of it when we say 
that one penny and one penny make two pennies Neither can he object 
when we add one gallon (of water) to one gallon (of alcohol) and do 



172 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


not obtain two gallons (of the alcohol-water mixture), but slightly less 
This last IS a profound experimental fact, intimately connected with the 
structure of ‘matter’ and, therefore, of the world around us The mathe- 
matician has nothing to do with the fact that his additive definitions, 
important as they are, do not co\er the facts of the world around us, 
which happens not to be additive in its more fundamental aspects. 

Also, the mathematical definition, one and one make two, is not 
invalidated by such non-additive facts The mathematician does not 
claim, but rather disclaims, content m its formulae There is no mention 
of pennies or apples or gallons of alcohol , It is simply a definite lan- 
guage of definitive structure for talking about anything which can be 
cohered If facts cannot be covered by given linguistic forms and 
methods, new forms, neu structures, new methods are invented or 
created to cover the structure of facts in nature. 

The mathematician created such a different language long ago He 
now calls his additive language ‘linear’, and the corresponding equations 
are of ‘first degree’ He calls his non-additive language ‘non-linear’ and 
the equations are of ‘higher degrees'. These latter equations happen to 
be much more difficult than the former and of complex structure, so that 
ver)' often they can be solv^ed only by approximation to linear equations. 
Now, without anj body's fault, the world around us does not happen to 
be an additiv e affair in its more fundamental structural aspects Perhaps 
the most important and beneficial results of the new physical theories is 
that they point out this structural fact, and take it into consideration 
The reader should recall the example about the man-made green leaf 
and the non-man-made green leaf, which differ in structure, and he 
will understand how our additive tendencies are the result of our primi- 
tive state of development and of this projection of our anthropomorphic 
point of view on the world We reversed the natural order and imposed 
on the world the structure of our verbal forms, instead of the natural 
order of patterning the structure of language after the structure of the 
world 

This digression was especially necessary before approaching the 
problem of ‘extension’ and ‘intension’ These have never been analysed 
from the point of view of structure and order, and whatever is known 
about them is taken for granted It is true that we hear now and then 
casual remarks that mathematicians had a predilection for extension and 
‘philosophers’ for intension, but these true remarks are not further 
analj'sed 

We usually forget that whenever a mathematician or a ‘philosopher’ 
produces a work, this involves his ‘attitude’, which represents an ex- 



ON ORDER 


173 


tremely complex psycho-logical ^ r of the organism-as-a-whole In most 
cases, these attitudes determine not only the character of our work, but 
also other reactions which make up our individual and social life His- 
torically, the mathematicians have a steadj record of achievement, and 
‘philosophers’ (excluding epistemologists) one of uselessness or failure 
Has this record something to do with the extensional and mtensional 
attitudes^ In fact, it has It is easy to show that the extensional attitude 
is the only one which is in accordance with the stii-vival order and ner- 
vous struLture, and that the mtensional attitude is the reversal of the 
natural order, and, therefore, must involve non-survnal or patho- 
logical j r 

One of the simplest wajs of approaching the problems of ‘extension’ 
and ‘intension’ is perhaps to point its connection with definitions A col- 
lection may be defined, so we are told, by enumeration of its members 
as, for instance, when we say that the collection contains Smith. Brown, 
Jones , Or we may define our collection by giving a defining property' 
We are told that the first type of definitions which enumerates individual 
members is to be called a definition by extension the second, which gives 
a defining ‘property’, is to be called a definition by intension 

We can easily see that a ‘definition by extension’ uniquely charac- 
terizes the collection, Smithi, Browni, Jonesi , Any other collection, 
Smiths, Brownj, Jones2 , would obviously be diflferent from the first one, 
since the individuals differ If we ‘define’ our collection by intension , 
that IS, by ascribing some characteristic to each of the individuals, for 
instance, that they have no tails many collections of individuals without 
tails might be selected Since these collections would be composed of 
entirely different individuals, they would be entirely different, yet by 
‘intension’, or defining characteristic, they all would be supposed to be 
one collection 

Similar contrast exists between relations in extension, and relations 
in intension. These relations have been defined more or less as follows 
‘Intensional relations are relations of “concepts” , extensional relations 
are relations of denoted facts’ Or, ‘relations of intension are those 
which are ascertainable a prion, a relation of extension is discoverable 
only by inspection of the existent’ Or, ‘intension covers the relations 
which hold for all the possible individuals, while extension holds only for 
the existent’. ‘A relation of intension is one which is only discoverable 
by logical analysis , a relation of extension is one which is only discover- 
able by the enumeration of particulars’ , * 

All that has just been said are perhaps standard definitions, but, 
for my purpose, they are profoundly unsatisfactory Because we have 



174 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


had no better understanding of this most important question of order, a 
great deal of confusion has occurred in human 'thought’ and many of our 
disciplines have become twisted in undesirable directions This, to a large 
degree, accounts for the obscurity which characterizes the problems we 
are dealing with in this book But it should be emphasized that even in 
this very unsatisfactory form, ‘intension’ and ‘extension’, as they were 
felt and applied {sr, largely disregarding the verbal formulations), have 
pla} ed an enormous role in the development of our forms of representa- 
tion, and our ‘civilization’ Unfortunately, without an ordinal analysis, 
it was impossible to evaluate properly the relative importance of these 
semantic attitudes, and to realize the serious importance of these prob- 
lems for a theory of sanity and resulting consequences 
^ Here, again, the knowledge which psychiatry gives will help a great 
' deal We know, in the rough, quite a little about two semantic mechan- 
I isras which are called extroversion and introversion In the rough, 

I again, the extrovert projects all that is going on within himself upon 
I the outside world, and believes that his personal projections have some 
kind of non-personal objective existence, and so have ‘the same’ validity 
I and value for other observers As a result, quite naturally, the extrovert 
I IS due to receive a great many unpleasant shocks, for the other observer 
does not necessarily observe or ‘perceive’ in the external events the 
characteristics which the first observer ‘finds’ He has often projected 
them from his ‘inside’, but they were entirely personal The first ob- 
) server, in his semantic conviction that his observations are the only, 
uniquely correct, observations, feels that the second observer is either 
blind in some way, or unfair to him In acute cases, he develops a mama 
of persecution He feels that everybody misunderstands him , nobody is 
fair to him, everybody is hostile to him, he will get even with them, in 
the name of ‘justice’, he will punish them , A dangerous and quite often 
incalculable bitterness and hostility follow Such types are usually trou- 
I blesome, and, if the affective components are strong, then such types are 
^ dangerously ill and liable to produce bloodshed or make other attacks 
The most pronounced types in this extreme direction are called paranoids 
and paranoiacs 

The introvert type is different He is mostly concentrated on what 
IS going on inside of his own skin Almost all of what is going on out- 
side of his skin, he interprets in personal terms and feelings Whatever 
unpleasant happens, he is ahvays guilty , always willing to take the blame, 
which IS quite often just, for many psycho-logical reasons upon which we 
cannot dwell here This type, in its extreme development, quite often

finds a solution m suicide. The most extreme cases are called ‘dementia 
praecox’ or ‘schizophrenic’ types. 

In everyday experience, it is seldom that such clear-cut types as 
just described can be observed For the purpose of studying such ex- 
treme types, one has to do researches in asylums Even there we find 
a great number of mixed cases In daily life we find in practically 
everybody a predominance of one or the other of these types of j r, but 
in some the two types appear to be inextricably mixed Observations 
upon this problem among so-called ‘normal’ men is difficult, as they rep- 
resent great complexities 

It has been already mentioned that the well-balanced man, a man 
who has survival value, should be a well-balanced mixture of both ten- 
dencies , namely, an extroverted-introvert, or, if we wish, an introverted- 
extrovert As yet, these problems, no matter how important they may be, 
are beyond our educational methods, and only in acute cases are they 
taken care of by physicians, and then mostly m asylums It is important 
to have simple means to deal with these semantic problems in elementary 
education as a preventive method, or as a branch of semantic hygiene 

Even this brief analysis shows how tremendously powerful the 
affective factors are which may be behind the unbalanced semantic atti- 
tudes The reader should not miss the fact that in both tjpes, nhen well 
developed, there is material for an extreme amount of self-imposed 
suffering Then the nervous energy produced by the organism is ab- 
sorbed in fighting phantoms, instead of being directed toward useful ends, 
such as regulating the normal activities of the organism, or fighting 
internal enemies, whereas, there should also be some energy left for 
activities and interests useful socially or for the survival of the race 

While the majority of individuals present different degrees of 
prevalence of one mechanism over the other, yet fairly clear-cut cases 
are to be found The extreme complexity of the structure of the nervous 
system of man justifies the enormous number of degrees recognized 
So large, indeed, is this number of possibilities, that we have little dif- 
ficulty in understanding that the individuality of every one is unique 

Extroverted and introverted individuals are usually born such; 
at least, they usually have a predisposition to be the one or the other To 
what extent these tendencies can be aggravated or improved by education 
IS not yet solved, and, indeed, has never been much bothered about To 
consider our activities merely as results of inborn tendencies is too nar- 
row a view The human ner\ous system is not finished at birth, and it 
continues its development for some time after the birth of the child. 
So it IS much more influenced by environmental conditions, the verbal

included, than ib the neivous system of an animal The make-up of the 
individual is thus some function of different variables, among which the 
hereditary inclinations and the environmental conditions appear in a 
relation, at present, not fully known The individual feels and acts ac- 
cording to his complex make-up, including acquired sr, no matter what 
factors have played a role in its moulding, and, as a rule, he is little in- 
fluenced by the way he rationalizes his activities From this point of 
view, we may consider that the extensional make-ups and intensional 
characters are bound to show themselves later on in life, no matter how 
the subject may have rationalized them, if his s r have not been modified 

It seems evident that the extroverted and introverted tendencies 
have some connection with extensional and intensional types of reac- 
tion , but, of course, they are not identical They influence the indn idual 
in the selection of a profession, and in the preference for some special 
trend of activity Thus, mathematicians, generally, have an inclination 
toward extension, ‘philosophers’ toward intension Now, it is interesting 
to note that mathematicians have a record of continuous constructive 
progress, and at each epoch have produced the highest kind of language 
known Also, the most important achievements in the fields which tra- 
ditionally belonged to ‘philosophers’ have actually been produced by 
mathematicians The ‘philosophers’, in the mam, have a record of 
failure 

The reason for this difference, which is too remarkable to be a mere 
coincidence, may be found by application of the term ‘order’ m our 
analysis The extensional method ts the only method zvhich is in accord- 
ance with the structure of our nervous system as established by survival 
Reversed intensional methods disoiganize this normal mode of activity 
of the nervous system, and so lead toward nervous and ‘mental’ illnesses 
' As explained before, the structure of our nervous system was estab- 
lished with ‘senses’ first, and ‘mind’ next. In neurological terms, the 
nervous impulses should be received first m the lower centres and pass 
on through the sub-cortical layers to the cortex, be influenced there and 
be transformed m the cortex by the effect of past experiences In this 
transformed state they' should then proceed to different destinations, 
as predetermined by the structure established by survival values We 
know, and let us remember this, that the reversed order m semantic 
manifestation — namely, the projection mto ‘senses’ of memory traces or 
doctrinal impulses — is against the survival structure, and hallucinations, 
delusions, illusions, and confusion of orders of abstractions are to be 
considered pathological In a ‘normal’ human nervous system with 
survival value, the nervous impulses should not be lost m the sub-cortical

177 


layers In such a case, the activity of our human nervous system would 
correspond to the activity of the less-developed nervous systems of ani- 
mals which have no cortex at all It must be remembered, also, that the 
sub-cortical layers which have a cortex, as in man, are quite different from 
corresponding layers of those animals which have never developed a cor' 
tex. It IS impossible to avoid the conclusion that survival values are 
sharply characterized by adequacy, and that animals without cortex have 
nervous systems adequate for their needs under their special conditions , 
otherwise, the}' would not have survived This applies, also, to those ani- 
mals who have a cortex Their activities for survival depend on this 
cortex, and when the cortex is removed, their activities become inade- 
quate Their sub-cortical layers alone are not adequate to insure sur- 
vival For survival, such animals must use not only their lower centres 
and their sub-cortical layers, but also their cortices 

Among animals, as all evidence shows, the enormous majority have, 
without human interference, nervous s} stems working usually m the 
<. 'normal’ vvay , that is, according to the survival structure ‘Insanity’ and 
j kindred nervous disturbances are known only among ourselves (hovv- 
i ever, see Part VI ) Apparently, the cortex, through its enormous internal 
complexity, which provides many more pathways, and through its com- 
plex interconnections, which offer many more possibilities, with a greater 
number of degrees of ‘inhibition’, of excitability, of delayed action, of 
activ'ation , introduces not only a much greater flexibility of reaction, but, 
through this flexibility, a possibility for abuse, for reversal of manifesta- 
tions, and so for a deterioration of the surviv'al activity of the nervous 
s}stem as-a- whole. The sub-cortical layers and other parts of the brain 
of man are different from the corresponding parts of the animal brain, 
which has a less-developed cortex The nervous system works as-a- 
vvhole, and the anatomical homology of the parts of different nervous 
systems is a very inadequate, perhaps even a misguiding, foundation for 
inferring a priori the functioning of these systems, which ultimately 
depend not only on the macroscopic but also on the microscopic and 
sub-microscopic structures For instance, we can cut off the head of 
some insects, and they go along quite happily and do not seem to mind 
the operation much But we could not repeat this with higher animals. 
The behaviour is changed A decorticated pigeon behaves differently from 
a decorticated rat, though neither of them seems affected greatly by the 
operation A decorticated dog or ape is affected much more Man is entirely 
changed None of the higher types is able to survive long if decorticated 
There is on record the medical history, reported by Edinger and 
Fischer, of a boy who was born entirely without cerebral cortex There

were apparently no other important defects. This child never showed 
any development of sensory or motor power, or of ‘intelligence’, or signs 
of hunger or thirst During the first jear of his life, he was continually 
m a state of profound stupor, without any movements, and from the 
second year on, until his death (at three years and nine months), was 
continually crying ® 

Although many animals, for instance fishes, have no differentiated 
cortex, yet their nervous sj stem is perfectly adequate for their lives and 
conditions But in a more complex nerious system, the relative func- 
tions of different parts of the brain undergo fundamental transforma- 
tion In the most complex nervous system, as found in man, the older 
parts of the brain are much more under the control of the cerebral 
cortex than in any of the animals, as is shown in the example above 
The absence of the human cortex involves a much more profound dis- 
turbance of the activities of the other parts of the brain Since the 
cortex has a profound influence upon the other parts of the brain, the in- 
sufficient use of the cortex must reflect detrimentally upon the function- 
ing of the other parts of the brain The enormous complexity of the 
structure of the human brain and the corresponding complexity of its 
functioning accounts not only for all human achievements, but also for all 
human difficulties It also explains why, in spite of the fact that our 
anatomy differs but little from that of some higher animals, veterinary 
science is more simple than human medicine 

Because of the structure of the nervous system, we see how the 
completion of one stage of the process which originated by an external 
stimulus (A) and has itself become a nervously elaborated end-product 
(B), may, in its turn, become the stimulus for a still further nervously 
elaborated ueiv end-product (C), and so on When association or rela- 
tion neurons enter, the number of possibilities is enormously increased 

It must be emphasized that A, B, C., are, fundamentally, entirely 
different For instance, the external event A' may be a falling stone, 
which is an entirely different affair from the pain we have when this 
stone falls on our foot It thus becomes clearer what is meant by a state- 
ment that the ‘senses’ abstract in their own appropriate way, determined 
by survival \alue, the external events, give these abstractions their spe- 
cial colouring (a blow on the eye gives us the feeling of hght) , discharge 
these transformed stimuli to further centres, m which they become again 
abstracted, coloured, transformed,. The end-product of this second 
abstracting is again an entirely different affair from the first abstraction 

Obviously, for sur\ival \alue, this extremely complex nervous sys- 
tem should work in complete co-ordination. Processes should pass the

entire cycle If not, there must be something wrong with the system. 
The activities of the organism are then regressive, of lower order, a con- 
dition known as ‘mental’ illness The gross anatomical divisions of the 
nervous system should not be relied upon too much as an index of func- 
tion Perhaps these anatomical speculations are even harmful for under- 
standing, because they falsify the facts, emphasize the macroscopic 
similarities unduly and disregard subtle yet fundamentally important 
microscopic and sub-microscopic structures and differences, which are 
perfectly manifest in the functioning, but which are difficult to observe 
directly on their level 

The term ‘abstracting’ is a multiordmal term, and hence has differ- 
ent meanings, depending on the order of abstractions It is a functional 
term and, to indicate the differences m meanings, it is necessary to indi- 
cate the different orders It is structurally a non-el term, built upon the 
extensional mathematical pattern x', x", x"' , or Xi, x^, x^, x^, or xic 

(k = 1, 2. 3, n) This allows us to give the term ‘abstracting of dif- 
ferent orders’ a perfectly unique meaning in a given problem and yet to 
keep in a fluid state its most important functional unphcations Some- 
thing similar happens when the mathematician discusses his No one 
can miss the fact that he deals with a variable which can take n values , 
so this symbol has a quite definite descriptive structural and semantic 
value So has the ‘abstracting of different orders’. 

It IS desirable to introduce consciously and deliberately terms of a 
structure similar to the structure of human knowledge, of our nervous 
system, and of the world, involving appropriate s r Multiordmal terms 
are uniquely appropriate, since they take their co-valued structure from 
the structure of events (1933) and do not reflect their older, one- valued, 
false to fact character on the events (Note the order ) 

Now we are ready to reformulate the problem of extension and 
intension m terms of aider. 

If the natural survival order is lower abstractions first and higher 
next, then extension starts with absolute individuals, and conforms to 
the proper survival order Extension recognizes the uniqueness, with 
corresponding one-value, of the individual by giving each individual a 
unique name, and so makes confusion impossible Training m sr of 
sanity becomes a possibility, and order becomes paramount Extension 
and order cannot be divided When we speak about ‘order’, we imply 
extension, and, when we speak about extension, order is implied That 
modern mathematics and mathematical ‘logic’ has so much to do with 
order, as to make this term fundamental, is a necessary consequence of 
the extensional method which starts with unique individuals, labels them 



180 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


by unique names and only then generalizes or passes to co-valued higher 
order abstractions like ‘numbers’. The direction of the process of ab- 
straction IS here in the survival order, from low er abstractions to higher. 
It hardly needs to be emphasized that, to the best of our knowledge in 
1933, It is the only possible way to follow the natural order and to evade 
reading into a fundamentally one-valued external event, our older undif- 
ferentiated 00 -valued fancies (w^hich happens if the process is reversed 
in order) involving powerful factors in our j r 

Intension means structurally the reversal of the survival order, since 
It starts with undifferentiated oo-valued higher abstractions and distorts 
or disregards the essential one-values of the individuals and reads into 
them as uniquely important undifferentiated oc-valued characteristics 
Historically, mathematicians have had a predilection and, because of 
the character of their ‘element’ (numbers) and their technique, a struc- 
tural necessity, for the use of extensional methods It does not need 
much imagination to see why they have produced results of utmost 
(although relative) importance and validity at each date 

‘Philosophers’ and reasoners of that class have had a predilection 
for intension, and this also explains why, in spite of tremendously acute 
verbal exercises, they have not produced anything of lasting value, for 
they were earned away by the structure of the language they used This 
predilection being already based on the reversal of the survival order, it 
was bound to lead in the less-resistant individuals to nervous and ‘mental’ 
defects 

The issues, as presented here, are very clear-cut, and, in fact, too 
clear-cut, as we have disregarded for the present the cyclic order of the 
nervous process This last fact first abolishes the sharp distinction be- 
tween ‘pure’ extension and ‘pure’ intension, each process never being 
‘pure’, but always ‘impure’, one influencing the other. ‘Pure’ intension 
and ‘pure’ extension are delusional, to be found only in ‘mentally’ ill, 
with no survival value This explains w^hy we have to use the terms of 
preference and order Without these terms I would not have been able 
to carry through this anal) sis at all This reversal of order in j r implies 
different distribution, diffusion, intensity of nerve currents in the sub- 
microscopic field, and so involves important, different semantic com- 
ponents of non-sun i\al lalue It is most desirable to learn to control 
the activities on the sub-microscopic level by means of training on the 
macroscopic level, if means to do this can be devised 

The writer is not at all convinced that, acting as we do under the 
spell of intensional and ignorant ‘philosophers’, the existing systems and 
educational methods are not largely following the reversal of the sur- 



ON ORDER 


181 


vival order of our nervous processes It seems unnecessary to point out 
that a structural and semantic enquiry on this particular question might 
be important and beneficial It seems, without much doubt, that human 
institutions and activities should be in accord with ‘human nature’, if we 
are to expect them to survive without crushing us, and a scientific 
enquiry in this ‘human nature’ would be not only desirable but exceed- 
ingly important 

The reader, with the help of another person, should perform a very 
simple experiment Let the assistant select secretly a dozen newspaper 
headlines of letters of equal size Let the reader then sit in a chair with- 
out altering his distance from the assistant and let the assistant show 
him one of these headlines If he is able to read the headline, it should 
be rejected, and a new one selected by the assistant and put a foot or 
more farther away If this one is read correctly, it should be rejected, 
and a third one placed still farther away By such trials we can finally 
find a distance w hich is slightly greater than the maximum range of clear 
visibility for the reader, so that, although the headline is only slightly 
beyond the distance at w’hich one could read it, yet it would be illegible 
Let the reader then try as hard as possible to read headlines which are 
just beyond his visual range When he is convinced that he cannot read 
the headline, let the assistant tell him the content of it Then the sitter 
can usually see w'lth his eyes the letters, when he knows what is sup- 
posed to be there The question arises, what part in the ‘seeing’ is due 
to ‘senses’, and w'hat to ‘mind’? The answer is, that, structurally, the 
‘seeing’ is the result of a cyclic interdependent process, which can be split 
only verbally The independent elements are fictitious and, structurally, 
have little or nothing to do with actual facts The human nervous sys- 
tem represents, structurally, a mutually interdependent cyclic chain, 
where each partial function is in the functional chain, together with 
enforcing and ‘inhibiting’, and other mechanisms 

Up to this stage, we have used the term ‘cyclic order’, but, m real- 
ity, the order is recurrent, though of a character better described by the 
‘spiral theory’, as explained in my Manhood of Humanity on p 233 In 
the ‘spiral theory’, we find the foundation for this peculiar stratification 
in levels and orders, which is necessitated by the structure and function 
of the human nervous system It should be noticed that the equations 
of the circle and spiral are non-hnear, non-plus equations 

The above relation underlies a fundamental mechanism, known in 
psychiatry as ‘sublimation’, in which, and by w'hich, quite primitive im- 
pulses, without losing their intensity and fundamental character, quite 
often are transformed from very pnniitive levels, which frequently 



182 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


represent vicious and anti-social effects, into desirable characteristics, 
socially useful Thus, a sadistic impulse may be sublimated into the 
socially useful vocation of the butcher, or, still further, into the skill and 
devotion to the service of their fellowmen, shown by many surgeons 
We see that this mechanism is of tremendous importance, and respon- 
sible for what we call ‘culture’ and many other values Our educational 
methods should understand this mechanism and apply this knowledge 
m the semantic training of youth It is important to realize that this 
mechanism appears as the only semantic mechanism of correction which 
IS m accord with the structure of the human nervous system, and so it 
seems workable Various metaphysical preachings usually start by dis- 
organizing the proper survival working of the human nervous system, 
and then we wonder that they fail, and that we cannot change ‘human 
nature’ To deal with ‘human nature’, which is not something static and 
absolute, we need to approach it with more structural understanding and 
less prejudice Then, and then only, can we eventually look for better 
semantic results 

The writer does not want the reader to conclude that, because in 
mathematics we have followed the survival order through extension, the 
mathematicians must, by necessity, be the sanest of the sane Quite often 
this IS not true, since many complexities exist which will be taken under 
analysis later. 

Section E Concluding remarks on order 

One thing remains fundamental , namely, that the problems of order 
and extension are of paramount structural importance for sanity and our 
lives They should be worked out and applied to the semantic training 
of the young m elementary education. This would certainly produce 
a new generation saner than we are, and one which would, perhaps, lead 
lives less troubled than our own, and so, perhaps, of better survival 
value 

To appreciate fully the immensity of the task of a more detailed 
analysis of the problems of ‘extension’ and ‘intension’, the reader is 
advised to read the Survey of Symbolic Logic, by Professor C. I Lewis, 
University of California Press, 1918, in which Chapter V is devoted 
to an important attempt at a formulation of strict implication of both 
extensional and mtensional character, which is the only organism- 
as-a-whole, non-el possibility Lewis’s theory of ‘strict implication’ 
introduces the notions of impossible propositions and so throws consid- 
erable light on the problem of non-sense, a light which is very seriously 
needed 



ON ORDER 


183 


In concluding, it must be mentioned that a theory of sanity, because 
of the survival value of order, cannot start with the older, undifferen- 
tiated similarities, which are a product of higher abstractions, and thus 
of later origin, but must start with differences as fundamental, and so 
preserve the structure and order of the survival trend as applied m this 
work 

Animals do not possess such a highly differentiated nervous svs- 
tem as human beings The difference between their higher and loi\er 
abstractions is thus not so fundamental, as we shall see later on With 
them the question of order is less impoitant, as they cannot alter it 
Animals have the benefit of better co-ordination, since in them the above- 
desciibed structural difficulties do not arise They have normally no 
‘insane' But, also, for the same reason, animals are not able to start 
every generation where the older left off. In other words, animals are 
not time-binders 

The structural complexity and differentiation of the nervous sys- 
tem in man is responsible, as is well known, not only for all our achieve- 
ments and control over the world around us, but also for practically all 
our human, mostly semantic difficulties, many •mental’ ills included The 
analysis in terms of order on the macroscopic level (semantic manifesta- 
tions) reveals a profound connection with sub-microscopic pioccsses of 
distribution , of nervous energy When the mechanism which controls 
these processes is properly understood, then they can be controlled and 
educated by special semantic training In other words, theoretical, doc- 
trinal, higher abstractions may have a stabilizing and regulating physio- 
logical effect on the function of our nervous system 

The reader may be interested to know that ‘order’ is very important 
in animal life An anal) sis of nest-building and the rearing of young 
among birds shows that each step of the cycle is necessary before the 
next step is taken. If the cycle is broken, they usually cannot adjust 
themselves to the new state of affairs, but must start from the begin- 
ning ® This IS a situation similar to our own hen we cannot recall a 
line in a poem, but have to start from the beginning of the piece in order 
to recapture it Pavlov was able, by the change of four-dimensional 
order of stimuli, to induce profound nervous disturbances in the nervous 
systems of his dogs , 

It appears, also, that m mild cases of aphasia, which is a neurologi- 
cal disturbance of linguistic processes, with ord-blmdness, word-deaf- 
ness , the notion of ‘order’ and ‘relations’ is often the first to be disturbed 
In some cases, lower order abstractions are carried out successfully, but 
calculation, algebra, and other higher order abstractions, which require 



184 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


ordered chains, become impossible The aphasic seems to have a general 
incapacity for grasping relations, realizing ordered series, or grasping 
their succession ’’ 

We see that the problems of order are somehow uniquely important, 
and so the investigation of the psycho-logics of mathematics, which is 
based on order, might give us means of at least partial control of dif- 
ferent undesirable human semantic afflictions. 

But, after all, we should not be surprised that it is so The struc- 
ture of nervous systems consists of ordered chains produced by the im- 
pact of external and internal stimuli in a four-dimensional space-time 
manifold, which have a spatial and also a temporal order. The introduc- 
tion of the finite velocity of nerve currents, which, although known, was, 
as a rule, disregarded by all of us, introduces automatically our ordering 
m ‘space’ and ‘time’ and, therefore, in space-time That is why the old 
anatomical three-dimensional analogies are vicious and false to facts 
when generalized For better or worse, we happen to live m a four- 
dimensional world, where ‘space’ and ‘time’ cannot be divided Whoever 
does this splitting must introduce fictitious, non-survival entities and 
influences into his system, which is moulded by this actual world and 
unable to adjust itself to fictions. 

It seems obvious that all these problems of ‘adjustment’ and ‘non- 
adjustment’, ‘fictitious’ or ‘actual’ worlds , are strictly connected with our 
s r toward these problems, and so ultimately with some structural knowl- 
edge about them But attitudes involve lower order abstractions, ‘emo- 
tions’, affective components, and other potent semantic factors which 
we have usually disregarded when dealing with science and with scien- 
tific problems and method. For adjustment, and, therefore, for sanity, 
we must take into account the neglected aspects of science, of mathe- 
matics, and of scientific method , namely, their semantic aspects In this 
way we shall abandon that other prevalent structural fiction referred to 
at the beginning of the present chapter , namely, that science and mathe- 
matics have an isolated existence 

The above considerations of order lead to a formulation of a funda- 
mental principle (a principle underlying the whole of the non-anstotelian 
system) , namely, that organisms which represent processes must develop 
in a certain natural survival four-dtmensional order, and that the reversal 
of that order must lead to pathological (non-survival) developments 
Observations disclose that, m all human difficulties, ‘mental’ ills included, 
a reversal of the natural order can be found as a matter of fact, once 
we decide to consider order as fundamental Any identification of inher- 
ently different levels, or confusion of orders of abstractions, leads auto-

185 


matically to the reversal of natural order As a method of preventive 
education and psychotherapy, whenever we succeed in reversing the 
reversed order or restoring the natural survival order, serious beneficial 
results are to be expected These theoretical conclusions have been fully 
justified by experience and the work of Doctor Philip S Graven in 
psychotherapy. It should be noticed that different primitive ‘magic of 
words’, or modern ‘hypostatizations’, ‘reifications’, ‘misplaced concrete- 
ness’, ‘objectifications’ , and all semantic disturbances represent nothing 
else but a confusion of orders of abstractions, or identifications in value 
of essentially different orders of abstractions 

The above considerations are entirely general, but, because of their 
novelty, they ha\ e not, as yet, been applied in the non-aristotchan simple 
and workable form to psj'chiatry or education In a very instructive 
paper on The Language of Schizophrenia,^ Doctor William A White 
applies some of these notions Because of the method of approach, I 
will quote from this paper It should be understood that this paper 
deals, also, with other issues, and the quotations do not do justice to the 
author, because I quote only those passages which are of particular inter- 
est here, omitting the literature gnen by Doctor White The italics and 
one footnote are mine 

‘It requires but a moment’s serious consideration to realize that the subject 
of schizophrenic language must be immense if for no other reason than that it 
involves an understanding of the whole subject of language of which it is but a 
part The extent and depth of the subject of language may be further appreciated 
from the fact that the single feature of its neuronic background as it is brought 
to attention in aphasia constitutes one of the most complex problems in the whole 
field of neurology and one with respect to which we are still hopelessly ignorant, 
especially when the enormous amount of work that has been done in this field is 
considered . . 

‘There have been a few other recent contributions to the subject of schizo- 
phrenic thought and speech which, as they run more in line with my own thinking 
on the subject, I will refer to more fully These studies equate the pioccsscs of 
thinking of schizophrenic persons with those of primitive peoples and of children 

‘ In the archaic thinking of a prelogical kind, found among primitive sav- 
age races, the vividness of the images is greater than among more highly developed 
races, and the effect produced in the observer is projected and believed to be an 
inherent attitude of the object, which thus acquires a “demonic” character All 
things which arouse a similar emotion are thought of as being actually the same 
In dementia praecox there is a similar loss of objectivity, hallucinations and reality 
are imperfectly distinguished, and every happening has a meaning and effect on the 
observer, the idea of an action produces the action directly, instead of offering a 
possibility of action, and this is interpreted as a compulsion from without Para- 
logical thinking is a stage beyond this, identification of objects is based on simi- 
larities, differences being neglected This form of thought is common in dementia 
praecox. 

‘ While for the normal person the chief criterion of the world of real ob- 

jects is their independence of him, whereas imaginary things depend for their 



186 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


existence on him, the general characteristic of the schizophrenic patient’s experience 
IS that his mental and imaginary experiences have a substantial and concrete nature 
when the normal person would see only symbols and analogies His thoughts have 
magic power and can produce real results , they have for him a substance and he 
can manipulate them physically 

‘Many other childish manifestations resemble those of schizophrenic persons 
children’s jokes, tricks, and plays in words have a similar autistic character, with 
no apparent meaning in relation to actualities, and this changes at puberty Chil- 
dren, like the patients, love to make up a sort of neoplastic language of their own, 
having meanings known only to themselves or their immediate circle Persevera- 
tion and stereotypy in speech and actions are often observed in children Their 
musical performances show the same mechanical rendering, and the same prefer- 
ence for simple melodies and rhythms as are found in schizophrenic patients 

‘Just m the same way we must be careful not to equate the regressive psychotic 
and the primitive too literally That there are close analogies in their respective 
ways of thinkmg there is no doubt and that the recognition of these analogies has 
been of the utmost importance in enabling us to understand schizophrenic thinking 
must be acknowledged but perhaps, to be on the safe side, the matter should rest 
there for the present at least 

‘Another point should be made at this time, after what has been said of the 
loss of the boundaries of the ego, its indefiniteness, etc These expressions are apt 
to be equated, if we do not think carefully, with such concepts as disintegration 
and dementia We must not lose sight of the magic of words and not be led astray 
by the old meanings when we are striving for new ones but are forced to use the 
words in current use Now regression to a childish or primitive level of this 
sort, which is what occurs in those conditions in which the ego is said to lose its 
clearness of definition, does not unply disintegration in the sense of disorder but 
regression to a different kind of order or, as my friend Korzybski would say, to a 
lower order of abstraction 

‘This IS important for a principle is embodied in the nature of this change 

‘This principle, namely, that the schizophrenic thought processes and language 
are of a loiver order of abstraction, accounts, in part at least, for another phe- 
nomenon If by a process of regression the mechanisms of thinking tend to ever 
more primitive levels then we should expect them ultimately to arrive at a con- 
crete perceptional level, and when this occurs hallucinations, which have long been 
regarded as evidence of the schizophrenic splitting, come into the picture While 
I believe that there must be other factors to account for the hallucinations they are 
at least to be expected as the natural outcome of regression — as are the forms of 
thought already referred to 

‘It comes about, therefore, that we cannot understand the language of the 
schizophrenic patient without the aid of these principles, because the language of 
a lower level of psychologic development, or a lower order of abstraction, must 
remain unintelligible to those who think in the terms of higher levels The whole 
problem of the understanding of the psychoses, from this point of view, might be 
well considered as the problem of the translation of the language of the psychoses 

‘Summary and Conclusions 

‘1 A complete understanding of the language of schizophrenia would imply 
an understanding of language in general of which schizophrenic language is only 
a part This would further imply an understanding of thought in general of which 
language is largely an expression Because of its extent this program is quite 
impossible, but certain principles need to be clearly in mind in order to avoid 
taking over, in any attempt to understand the language of schizophrenia, certain 
misconceptions in both of these territories which are still rife, not having been 
as yet fully replaced by the newer ways of thinking about the matters involved

‘2 There is one psjchiatric assumption I ha\e made and which is fundamental 
to my approach to the problem of the language of schizophrenia It is that schizo- 
phrenia is a regression psjchosis This is of the greatest importance for, if it is 
true, we should expect to find in the thinking and in the language of schizophrenic 
patients characteristics of earlier stages ot development, earlier genetic levels 

‘3 The deielopment or evolution of thought and speech, the assumption of 
genetic let els, implies that there must be a latt> in accordance zeith which this dez'cl- 
opntcnt proceeds This law is that thought and language m their deielopment 
change from feeling, concreteness and perception in the direction of reasoning, 
differentiation and abstraction 

‘4 The law of schizophrenic thought and language must be the rezerse of the 
law for their dezelopment, on the assumption that schizophrenia is a regression 
ps>chosis 

‘5 Tins rcz’crsal of the law of development implies results that are zerj, dif- 
ferent from those implied iii the old terms " disi>ite<jratioi'" and 'diiiieiria" 

‘6 This reversal can be briefl 3 and simp!} indicated The language of schizo- 
phrenia IS of a lower order of abstraction than normal adult language 

'7 The thinking and the speech of schizophrenia while of a lower ord<.r of 
abstraction nei ertheless make use of words w'hich we are accustomed to ii'C to 
express a higher order This discrepancy is one reason whj such language is so 
hard for us to understand Another reason for our difficult} in understanding the 
schizophrenic patient is that while some of his s\mbols are of a lower order of 
abstraction by no means all of them are so that there is a strange nurture which 
further confuses our understanding Still another difficult} is due to the magic 
of words * We are still far from free of this influence and are therefore forced 
to think that when there is a word there must be a thing corresponding to it and 
also forced to think of the wording as necessarily meaning what it usuall> has 
meant in our experience 

‘8 TI}e reversal of the law of dezelopment in schizophrenia also accounts in 
part at least, for hallucinations which have long been regarded as signs of the 
schizophrenic splitting Regression must lead ultimatel} to concrete perceptional 
configurations and all chat that implies 

'12 For the understanding of the language of schizophrenia, therefore, the 
whole dynamic situation needs to be comprehended The main obstacle to this un- 
derstanding has been, in the past, the magic of words * 

Identification, or the confusion of orders of abstractions, in an 
aristotehan or infantile s}steni, plats a much more pernicious role than 
the present official psichiatr} recognizes Any identification, at any level, 
or of any orders, represents a non-survival s r which leads invariably to 
the reversal of the natural survival order, and becomes the foundation 
for general improper evaluation, and, therefore, general lack of adjust- 
ment, no matter whether the maladjustment is subtle as in daily life, or 
whether it is aggravated as in cases of schizophrenia A non-aristotelian 
system, by a complete elimination of 'identity' and identification, supplies 
simple yet effective means for the elimination by preventive education 
of this general source of maladjustment Book II is entirely devoted 
to this subject

CHAPTER XIII 


ON RELATIONS 


To be is to be related. (2«) cassius j keyser 

Science, in other words, is a system of relations (4i7) H foincare 

Asymmetrical relations are involved in all series — in space and time, 
greater and less, whole and part, and many others of the most important 
characteristics of the actual world All these aspects, therefore, the logic 
which reduces everything to subjects and predicates is compelled to con- 
demn as error and mere appearance (453) Bertrand russell 

My own investigations in this field, extending over some fifteen years, 
together with the facts already at hand, as I see them, have forced me to 
the conclusion that the organic individual is fundamentally . . a system 

of relations between a physical substratum or structure and chemical re- 
actions. (901 CHARLES M CHILD 

The thalamus, which in the lower vertebrates deprived of the cortex 
ensures the general reactions of the organism and the elementary mental 
functions, possesses an affective excitability in relation with the profound 
biological tendencies of the organism, among the higher mammals, indeed, 
It seems to preserve this rfile of affective regulation, whose importance in 
the behaviour of the organism and mental life is so often misunderstood 
(411) HENRI PliiRON 

organic impressions (‘interoceptive’ sensibility) appear in all. cases 
to arrive at the cortex only when translated by the thalamus, with its 
own affective elaboration (4ii) henri pi^ron 

Nevertheless, the consuming hunger of the uncritical mind for what it 
imagines to be certainty or finality impels it to feast upon shadows in the 
prevailing famine of substance ( 22 ) e t bell 


In the foregoing chapters I made use of an expression, ‘the organ- 
ism-as-a-whole’, which is employed continually in biology, psychiatry, 
and other branches of science This expression is a restricted form of 
the general structural principle of non-elementalism This expression 
implies that an organism is not a mere algebraic sum of its parts, but is 
more than that, and must be treated as an integrated whole It was men- 
tioned that the non-additivity and the ‘more’ than a mere ‘sum’ are 
complex problems which call for a new method of analysis We ha\e 
already seen that a simple analysis of the expression, ‘Smith kicks 
Brown’, involves a full-fledged structural metaphysics, or set of assump- 
tions and terms which are taken on faith, since they cannot be defined, 
except circularly In the present chapter, these subjects of great semantic 
importance will be developed further 

One of the fundamental structural defects and insufficiencies of the 
traditional -system was that it had no place for ‘relations’, since it 

188

assumed that everything could be expressed in a subject-predicate form. 
As we shall see, this is not true. Restriction to the subject-predicate form 
leaves out some of the most important structural means we have for 
representing this world and ourselves and has resulted in a general state 
of un-sanity The explicit introduction of ‘relations’ is rather a recent 
innovation A few words may be said about them, although the term 
‘relation’ is one of the terms that we may accept as undefined, or that we 
may define m terms of multi-dimensional order 

Some relations, when they hold between A and B, hold also be- 
tween B and A Such relations are called symmetrical For instance, the 
relation ‘spouse’ If it holds between A and B, it holds also between 
B and A If A is the spouse of B, B is the spouse of A Terms like 
‘similarity’ and ‘dissimilarity’ also designate relations of this kind If 
A IS similar or dissimilar to B, so is B similar or dissimilar to A In 
general, a symmetrical relation is such that, if it holds between A and B, 
it also holds between B and A In other words, the order m which we 
consider the relation of our entities is immaterial 

It IS easy to see that not all relations are of such a character For 
instance, in the relation ‘A is the brother of B’, B is not necessarily a 
brother of A, because B might be the sister of A In general, relations 
which hold between A and B, but not necessarily between B and A, are 
called non-symmetrical In these relations order becomes important It 
IS not a matter of indifference in what order we consider our entities 
If a relation is such that, if it holds betw'een A and B, it never holds 
between B and A, it is called asymmetrical. Let us take, for instance, 
the relations ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘husband’. We readily see that if A is 
a father, or mother, or husband of B, B is never a father, or mother, or 
husband of A The reversal of order is impossible in asymmetrical rela- 
itions, and so any asymmetrical relation establishes a definite order 

Relations such as before, after, greater, more, less, above, to the 
right, to the left, part, and whole, and a great many others of the most 
important terms we have, are asymmetrical The reader may easily 
verify this for himself For instance, if A is more than B, B is never 
more than A , We see at once that the troublesome little words, which 
are necessary to express order as ‘before’ and ‘after’ ; terms of evalua- 
tion, such as ‘more’ and ‘less’, and terms on which elementalism or 
non-elementahsm depends, such as ‘part’ and ‘whole’, are in the list of 
asj’mmetncal relations 

Relations can be classified in another way, when three or more 
terms are considered Some relations, called transitive, are such that, 
whenever they hold between A and B and also betw’een B and C, they 



190 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


hold between A and C For example, if A is before, or after, or above, 
or more , than B, and B is before, or after, or above, or more , than C, 
then A is before, or after, or above, or more , than C 

It should be noted that all relations which give origin to series are 
transitive But so are many others In the above examples, the rela- 
tions were transitive and asymmetrical, but there are numerous relations 
which are transitive and symmetrical Among these are relations of 
equality, of being equally numerous , 

Relations which are not transitive are called non-transiti\ e For 
instance, dissimilarity is not transitive If A is dissimilar to B, and B 
dissimilar to C, it does not follow that A is dissimilar to C 

Relations which, whenever they hold between A and B, never hold 
between A and C are called intransitive ‘Father’, ‘one inch longer’, 
‘one year later’ , are intransitive relations 

Relations are classified in several other ways , but, for our purpose, 
the above will be sufficient 

It IS necessary now to compare the relational forms with the sub- 
ject-predicate form of representation, which structurally underlies the 
traditional -system and two- valued ‘logic’. The structural question 
arises whether all relations can be reduced to the subject-predicate forms 
of language 

Symmetrical relations, which hold between B and A whenever they 
hold between A and B, seem plausibly expressed m the subject-predicate 
language A symmetrical and transitive relation, such as that of ‘equal- 
ity’, could be expressed as the possession of a common ‘property’ A 
non-transitive relation, such as that of ‘inequality’, could also be consid- 
ered as representing ‘different properties’ But when we analyse asym- 
metrical relations, the situation becomes obviously different, and w'e find 
it a structural impossibility to give an adequate representation in terms 
of ‘properties’ and subject-predicates 

This fact has very serious semantic consequences, for we ha\e al- 
ready seen that some of the most important relations we know at pres- 
ent belong to the asymmetrical class For example, the term ‘greater’ 
obviously differs from the term ‘unequal’, and ‘father’ from the term 
relative’ If two things are said to be unequal, this statement conveys 
that they differ m the magnitude of some ‘property’ without designating 
the greater We could also say that they have different magnitudes, be- 
cause inequality is a symmetrical relation , but if we were to say that a 
thing IS unequal to another, or that the two have different magnitudes, 
when one of them was greater than the other, we simply should not give 
an adequate account of the structural facts at hand If A is greater than 



ON RELATIONS 


191 


B, and we merely state that the> are unequal or of different magnitudes, 
we imply the possibility that B is greater than A, which is false to facts. 
To give an adequate account, and to prevent false implications, there 
IS no other way than to say which one is greater than the other W’e 
see that it is impossible to gue an A adequate account when asymmetri- 
cal relations are present The possession of the ‘same’ ‘property’, or of 
different ‘properties’, are both symmetrical relations and seem covered 
by the subject-predicate form But it is impossible to account adequately 
for asymmetrical relations in terms of ‘properties’ In other words, we 
see that a language and ‘logic’ based upon subject-predicate structure 
may perhaps express sj mmetncal relations, but fail to express adequately 
asymmetrical relations, because both ‘sameness’ and difference of predi- 
cates are symmetrical ^ Asymmetrical relations introduce a language of 
new structure, involving new sr Yet asymmetrical relations include 
many of the most important ones They are involved m all order, all 
scries, all function, in ‘space’, in ‘time’, in ‘greater’ and ‘less ‘more’ and 
‘less’, ‘whole’ and ‘part’, ‘infinity’, ‘space-time’. If we are restricted to 
the use of forms of representation unfitted for the expression of asym- 
metrical relations, ordinal, serial, functional, and structural problems 
could not be dealt with adequately We should also ha\e many insoluble 
semantic puzzles in connection with ‘space’, ‘time’, ‘cause and effect’, 
and many other relations in the world around us, and oursehcs 

A very interesting structural and semantic fact should be noticed 
that in symmetrical relations order is immaterial, in non-sy mmetncal 
relations it is important, and in asymmetrical relations o>dcr plays an 
all-important role and cannot be reversed Order itself is expressed in 
terms of asymmetrical relations, as, for instance, ‘before’ or ‘after’, 
which appN to ‘space’, to ‘time’, ‘space-time’, ‘structure’ , and also to 
all processes and activities, the activities of the ner\ ous sy stem included 
The asymmetrical relations ‘greater’, ‘father’ , imply^ ordering, while the 
‘unequal’ (having different ‘properties’) or a ‘relative’ , do npt imply 
ordering If we consider subject-predicate forms as expressing a rela- 
tion between the ‘observer’ and the ‘observed’, excluding humans this 
last relation is also asymmetrical Applying correct symbolism if a 
leaf appears green to me, I certainly do not ‘appear green’ to the leaf ' 
The last remark suggests that any A revision of the //-sy’^stem is struc- 
turally impossible To attempt a revision, we must begin with the formu- 
lation of a ^-sy'stem of different structure 

The above simple considerations have very far-reaching conse- 
quences, as without relations, and particularly w'lthout asymmetrical 
relations, we cannot have order, and without order, in the analysis of 



192 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


processes, we '*re bound to introduce explicity or implicitly some objec- 
tively meaningless ‘infinite velocities' of the propagation of the process 
Thus, the ‘infinite velocity’ of light, which is known to be false to facts, 
is at the very foundation of the i\I-system The equally false to facts 
silent assumption of the ‘infinite velocity’ of nerve currents underlies 
A animalistic ‘ps} chology’ and results in elementahsm This el ‘psychol- 
ogy’, until this day, vitiates all human concerns and even all science, the 
newer quantum theories not excluded 

General non-elementahsm and, in particular, its restricted aspect, 
the ‘organism-as-a-i\hole’, implies the relation of the ‘parts’ to the ‘whole’, 
for which we need asymmetrical relations In the statement ‘more than 
an algebraic sum’, ‘more’ is also an asymmetrical relation When we 
analysed the statement, ‘Smith kicks Brown’, we saw that the prob- 
lems of ‘space’, ‘time’, ‘infinity’ , entered, the solution of which requires 
serial notions, which evade analysis without asymmetrical relations 

The solution of the problems of ‘space’ and ‘time’ are fundamental 
for a theory of sanity, as they are potent structural factors in all sr 
In the majority of ‘mentally’ ill, we find a disorientation as to ‘space’ 
and ‘time’ Similar milder forms of disorientation appear in all forms 
of semantic disturbances, as they are disturbances of evaluation and 
meanings in the form of delusional ‘absolute space’ and ‘absolute time’ 
These semantic disturbances can be eliminated only by considerations of 
multi-dimensional order, which are impossible without asymmetrical re- 
lations, and so could not have been accomplished m an /i-system 

The problems of multi-dimensional order and asymmetrical rela- 
tions are strictly interdependent and are the foundation of structure and 
so of human ‘knowledge’ , and they underlie the problems of human ad- 
justment and sanity Without going into details, I shall suggest some 
relational and ordinal aspects as found m the structure and function of 
the human nervous system and their bearing on semantic reactions and 
sanity I shall also apply these considerations to the analysis of a his- 
torically very important delusional factor which has influenced, until 
now, the sr oi mankind away from sanity I am dealing only with 
selected topics, important for my purpose, which, to the reader, may 
appear one-sided and unduly isolated In fact, all issues involved are 
strictly interconnected in a circular way, and no verbal analysis of objec- 
tive levels can ever be ‘complete’ or ‘exhaustive’, and this should be 
remembered On the A silent assumption of the infinite velocity of 
nervous impulses, that the nervous impulses spread ‘instantaneously’, ‘m 
no time’ (to use an Alice-m-Wonderland expression), order was of no 
importance. But when we take into account the Unite and known velocity

193 


of nervous impulses, and the serial, chain structure of the nervous sys- 
tem, order becomes paramount In such a serial structure, the problems 
of resistance, ‘inhibitions’, blockage, activation , become intelligible, so 
that some sane orientation is possible in this maze It may be added that 
the intensity and the transformation of nervous impulses must somehow 
be connected with the paths they travel and are, therefore, problems to 
be spoken about iii rerms of order 

What has just been said may be illustrated by a rough and over- 
simplified hypothetical diagram Fig 1 shows how the normal (survival 
in man) impulse should travel It should 
pass the thalamus, pass the sub-cortical lay- 
ers, reach the cortex, and return That the 
impulse is altered m passing this complicated 
chain IS indicated in the diagram by the arbi- 
trarily diminishing thickness of the line of 
the impulse 

Fig 2 illustrates an hypothetical abnor- 
mal (non-survival m man) impulse It 
emerges from the lower centres For some 
reason or other, the mam impulse is blocked 
semantically, or otherwise, and does not 
reach the cortex, only a weak impulse does What should be expected 
m such a case? We should expect regression to the level of activities of 
organisms which have no cortex, or a cortex very little developed But 
this could not be entirely true, as organisms 
without a cortex have a nervous system ade- 
quate for their lives, activities , m their en- 
vironment, with survival values But a higher 
organism with a cortex, no matter how rudi- 
mentary, has the other parts of the nervous 
structure quite different in function, and 
without the cortex they are inadequate for 
survival, as experience shows We see that 
the order in which the impulses pass, or are 
deviated from their survival path, is para- 
mount A great many different reasons 
may produce such deviation, too many to 
list conveniently A great many of them are known, in spite of the fact 
that, in general, we know very little about nerve mechanisms Suffice 
to say, that we know, on colloidal grounds and from experience, that 
macroscopic or microscopic lesions, drugs, and false doctrines affecting

194 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


the sub-microscopic levels, may often produce similar end-results Here 
I use the term ‘false doctrines’ in the non-el sense, and, therefore, take 
into account affective and evalmtton-com^onents, which are usually dis- 
regarded when we speak about ‘false doctrines’ 

Here we must consider a problem of crucial, general human sig- 
nificance It seems evident that evaluation in life, and particularly m 
human life, represents a most fundamental psycho-logical process under- 
lying motivation and, in general, r r, which shape our behaviour and 
result in collective structures which we may call ‘stages of cii ilization’ 

We may distinguish three periods of human development as char- 
acterized by their standards of evaluation 

1) The pre-human and primitive period of literal, general, and 
unrestricted identification The semantics of this period could be for- 
mulated roughly as ‘everything is everything else’, which might be called 
one-valued semantics 

2) The infantile, or A period of partial or restricted identification, 
allowing symmetrical relations, to the exclusion of asymmetrical rela- 
tions Its semantics iniolve, among others, the ‘law of identity’ — ‘e\erj- 
thing IS identical with itself’, its two-valued character being expressed 
by the postulate ‘A is B or not B’ 

3) The adult, or A, or scientific period based on the complete 
elimination of identification, by means of asymmetrical and other rela- 
tions, which establishes structure as the foundation of all ‘knowledge’ 
Its semantics follow the oo-valued semantics of probability and recognize 
‘equality’, ‘equivalence’ , but no ‘identity’ 

Before analysing the above three periods separately, it must be 
stated that ‘identity’, defined as ‘absolute sameness’, necessitates ‘abso- 
lute sameness’ m ‘all’ aspects, never to be found in this world, nor m 
our heads Anj'thmg with which we deal on the objective levels repre- 
sents a process, different all the ‘time’, no matter how slow or fast the 
process might be, therefore, a principle or a premise that ‘ever} thing 
IS identical with itself’ is invariably false to facts From a structural 
point of view, it represents a foundation for a linguistic system non- 
similar in structure to the world or ourselves All world pictures, specu- 
lations and sr based on such premises must build for us delusional 
worlds, and an optimum adjustment to an actual world, so fundamentallv 
different from our fancies, must, m pnnciple, be impossible 

If we take even a symbolic expression 1 = 1, ‘absolute sameness’ in 
‘all’ aspects is equally impossible, although we may use m this connection 
terms such as ‘equal’, ‘equivalent’, ‘Absolute sameness m all aspects’ 
would necessitate an identity of different nervous systems which produce 



ON RELATIONS 


195 


and use these symbols, an identity of the different states of the nervous 
system of the person who wrote the above two symbols, an identity of 
the surfaces , of different parts of the paper, in the distribution of ink, 
and what not To demand such impossible conditions is, of course, 
absurd, but it is equally absurd and very harmful for sanity and civ- 
ilization to preserve until this day such delusional formulations as stan- 
dards of evaluation, and then spend a lifetime of suffering and toil to 
evade the consequences This may be comparable to the spending of 
many years in teaching and training our children that one and one never 
equal two, that twice two never equal four , and then they would have 
to spend a lifetime full of surprises and disappointments, if not trage- 
dies, to learn, when they are about to die, that the above statements are 
always correct in mathematics and very often true m daily life, and 
finally acquire the sadly belated wisdom that they were taught false 
doctrines and trained in delusional sr from the beginning 

If we revised these false doctrines, we would not twist the lives of 
younger generations to begin with It seems that, for the sake of sanity, 
the term ‘identity’, symbolizing such a fundamental false structural doc- 
trine, should be entirely eliminated from the vocabulary, but the term 
‘identification’ should be retained m psychiatry as a label for extremely 
wide-spread delusional states which, at present, in a mild form, affect 
the majority of us 

If we investigate the standards of evaluation of animals, the ex- 
periments of Pavlov and his followers show that, after establishing a 
‘conditional reflex’ (which means a physiological relating of a signal 
wuth food, for instance), the physiological effect of the signal on the 
nervous system of the animal is to produce secretions similar in quan- 
tity and quality to those the food produces We can thus say that, from 
a physiological point of view, the animal organism identifies the signal 
with food That represents the animal standard of evaluation at that 
given period But even the animal nervous system is flexible enough to 
learn by experience that identification has no survival value, for, if, after 
the signal, food is repeatedly not forthcoming, he identifies again the 
signal with the absence of food In more complex experiments, when 
both these identifications are interplayed, the result is a real physiological 
dilemma, culminating, usually, in a more or less profound nervous dis- 
turbance, corresponding to ‘mental’ ills in humans 

asyml/fen^Lfication represents a comparatively unflexible, rigid form of 
repeatedly, laf low degree conditionality, so to say, and, by neurological 
necessity, represents the processes of animal adaptation, inadequate for 
modern man On human levels, it is found best exemplified in primitive 



196 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


peoples and in cases of ‘mentall>’ ill In less severe cases of semantic 
disturbances, we also find identification of different degrees of intensity 
The milder cases are usually considered as ‘normal’, which, m principle, 
is very harmful, because it establishes an animalistic, or primitive, stan- 
dard of eialuation for 'normal' ‘Identity’, as we have seen, is invariabh 
false to facts, and so identification produces, and must produce, non- 
survival sr, and, therefore, must be considered pathological for mod- 
em man 

That identification afflicts the majority of us today is also shown 
by experiments with conditional reflexes and the psychogalvanic experi- 
ments ^^hlch show clearly that the majority of humans identify the sjm- 
bol uith actualities, and secretions very often follow In other uords, 
the reactions are of such a low order of conditionality as we find in 
animals and m pnmitiie men In principle, it makes no difference 
whether a sound (or word), or other signal (symbol) is identified with 
food or other actualities which are not symbols, and the secretions are 
produced by the adrenal glands, for instance, resulting in fear or anger, 
instead of by the salnarj’ or sweat glands In all such cases, in expert- 
ments with humans, the evaluation is false to facts, and the physiological 
secretion is uncalled for if the evaluation would be appi opriate to the 
situation In \ery few instances, the human experiments wnth condi- 
tional and psychogalvanic reflexes break down, in the sense that the 
signal-sjmbol is not identified with first order actualities, and so such 
an organism has no uncontrolled glandular secretions for signal-symbols 
alone In a ^-system of eialuation, which imolves on semantic levels 
the consciousness of abstracting, these exceptional persons (1933), w'lth 
proper evaluation and controlled reactions, prove the rule for modem 
man In other words, modern man, when he stops the pre-human and 
primitive identification, will have a much-increased and conscious con- 
trol of his secretions, colloidal states of his nen-ous system . , and so of 
his reactions and behaviour The above applies to all j r, ‘logical’ pro- 
cesses included 

Identification is found m all known forms of ‘mental’ ills A sym- 
bol, m any form, or any j r may be identified m value with some fictitious 
‘reality’ at a given date, resulting m macro-physiological (glandular, for 
instance) or micro-ph) siological (colloidal ,) activities or disturbances 
which result in particular semantic states and behanour It is impos- 
sible to deny that ‘mentally’ ill have inappropriate standa sanieiiess' in

agencies which affect the colloids of the nervous system, by environ- 
mental changes , and by changing the standards of evaluation which, at 
present, is usually called ‘psychotherapy’ The analysis of the mechan- 
ism of evaluation leads, naturally, to a generalized and simplified method, 
which may have not only a therapeutic but also an important new pre- 
ventive value 

Literal identification is found in all pnmitiie peoples and accounts 
for their semantic states, reactions, their metaphysics, low development , 
but It IS impossible, for lack of space, to go into details here 

The A standard of evaluation departed from literal identification to 
some extent. We still preserve in our school books as the most funda- 
mental ‘law of thought’ — the ‘law of identity’ — often expressed in the 
form ‘everything is identical with itself’, which, as we have seen, is 
invariably false to facts We do not realize that, m a human world, we 
are dealing at most only with ‘equality’, ‘equivalence’ , at a given place 
and date, or by definition, but never with ‘identity’, or ‘absolute same- 
ness’, disregarding entirely space-time relations, involving ‘all’ the 
indefinitely many aspects which, through human ingenuity, we often 
manufacture at w ill In an actual world of four-dimensional processes 
and the indefinitely many ‘aspects’ manufactured by oursches, adjustment 
in principle is impossible, or, at best, only accidental, if we retain ‘iden- 
tity’ The A evaluation was based on symmetrical relations of ‘identity’ 
and also partial ‘identity’, expressed e^en in our political, economic , 
doctrines and corresponding behaviour, the analysis of which would 
require a special volume to be written, I hope soon, by some one 

Under the pre-human and primitive standards of evaluation, science 
was not possible Under the A standards the beginnings of science be- 
came possible, but if science had not departed from those standards, we 
would have had no modern science Lately, when the persecution of 
science has increasingly relaxed (not in all countries m a similar de- 
gree) and scientists were allowed to develop their disciplines with much 
less fear of persecution, sometimes even encouraged and helped by public 
interest, scientists found that they iniariably had to build their own 
vocabularies of a distinctly, although unrealized, A character The chasm 
between human affairs and science became wider and wider The reason 
for ’<■ was that, in life, even at present, we preserve A standards of 
evaluation, and science mainly depends on subtler A means involving 
asymniclnci. ’elations which alone can give us structure I will return 
repeaterlh Li r on, to the A re-e valuation of the A standards of values 

The . 7 ev iluation is I ised on asymmetrical and other relations I

large and this whole volume is devoted to that subject Here I shall 
mention, once more, that only with A standards of evaluation does a 
scientific treatment of man and his affairs become possible A H-system 
depends on a complete elimination of identification which affects bene- 
ficially all our j r, as experience and experiments show 

It has been already emphasized that m the human child the nervous 
system is not physicalh" finished at birth, and that for some years there- 
after it IS plastic Hence, the ‘environment' — which includes languages, 
doctrines, with their structure, all connected with evaluation-components 
— conditions the future functioning of the system The way in which the 
nervous system works, the ‘sanity’, ‘un-sanity‘ and ‘insanity’ of the in- 
dividual depends to a large extent on how this plastic and sensitive 
apparatus is treated, particularly in childhood Because of the serial 
structure of the nerv'ous system, the language and doctrines supplied 
should be of the structure necessary for the adequate representation of 
serial structures and functions With the old A means this could not 
be accomplished 

At this point. It will be well to introduce an important semantic 
subject, to which we shall return later, namely, the connection between 
the primitive subject-predicate language and identification For ex- 
ample, the statement, ‘the leaf is green’, is taken to imply ‘greenness’, 
which, by its verbal structure, has the character of a ‘substantive’ and 
implies some sort of objective independence It is not considered as an 
asymmetrical relation between the observer and the observed and, ac- 
cording!)', tends toward an additive implication ‘Greenness' is thus 
objectified and added to the leaf in describing a ‘green leaf’ The objec- 
tified ‘greenness’ leads to an anthropomorphic mythology, which, in turn, 
involves and develops the undifferentiated projecting mechanism so fun- 
damental in semantic disturbances The objectification is evaluated 
structurally as a ‘real’ situation, and this introduces the non-survival 
reversed order evaluation in which the use of the ‘is’ of identity, result- 
ing in identification, is the main factor The stronger the structural ‘be- 
lief’ m the ‘truth’ of the representation, or, in other W'ords, the more 
we identify the higher order abstractions with the lower, which, m fact, 
are different, the more dangerous becomes the ‘emotional’ tension in the 
form of unjustified evaluation, which, ultimately, must involve delusional 
factors, no matter how slight, and result in semantic disturbances Ignor- 
ance, involving strong faith in the erroneous structural belief, is dan- 
gerously akin to more developed symptoms of ‘mental’ illness called 
illusions, delusions, and hallucinations We are mostly semantic vic- 
tims of the primitive doctrines which underlie the A structure of our

language, and so we populate the uorld around us with semantic phan- 
toms which add to our fears and worries or which lead to abnormal 
cheerfulness, well known among some ‘mentally’ ill 

It should be realized that in the A sj'stem of evaluation many indi- 
viduals profit in various waj-s by what amounts to distracting the atten- 
tion of mankind from actual life problems, which make us forget or 
disregard actualities They often supply us with phantom semantic struc- 
tures, while they devote their attention to the control of actualities not 
seldom for their personal benefit If one surveys the A situation impar- 
tially, one occasionally feels hopeless But, no matter how we now con- 
spire one against another, and thus, in the long run, against ourselves, 
the plain realization that the difficulty is found in the standards of 
evaluation, establishes the necessaiw' preliminary step to the escape 

It IS a well-known fact that, in a large proportion of ‘mental’ ills, 
w'e find a semantic flight from ‘realitj’ (mo) w'hen their ‘reality’ be- 
comes too hard to endure It is not difficult to see that different rajiih- 
ologies, cults , often supply such structural semantic ‘flights from reality’ , 
and that those who actually help, or who are professionally or otherwise 
engaged in producing and promulgating such semantic flights, help man- 
kind to be uii-sane, to deal with phantoms, to create dream states , There 
IS no longer any excuse in the old animalistic law of supply and demand 
— ^that, because there is a demand foi such flights, they should be sup- 
plied That argument is not held to apply to those w ho peddle drugs or 
wood alcohol The flights from reality always have the earmarks of 
‘mental’ illness Very often such actively engaged individuals are them- 
selves ill to the point of hallucinations, they often ‘hear voices’, ‘see 
visions’, ‘speak tongues’. Very often other morbid S3mptoms occur 
which are similar to those shown by tbe ‘mentally’ ill of the usual hos- 
pital types It IS not generally realized that, although the patient suffers 
intensely, he usually shows marked resistance to any attempt to relieve 
him of his semantic affliction Only after he is relie\ed by semantic 
re-education does the patient realize how very unhappy he was 

The situation is very serious There is a powerful well-organized 
system, w ith enormous w ealth behind it, based on A and pre-aristotelian 
standards of evaluation which keeps mankind in delusional semantic 
states Its members do their best, better than they know, to keep man- 
kind un-sane in flights from ‘reality’, instead of helping to revise the A 
standards of evaluation and to reorganize the horrible ‘realities’, all of 
our own making, into realities less painful The comparatively few psy- 
chiatrists are naturally not a match for such vast numbers of well- 



200 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


organized men and women who, m their blissful ignorance, work m the 
opposite diiection, and all of us pay the price 

The acti\ ities of these individuals often promulgate something simi- 
lar to the well-known ‘induced insanity’ Quite often paranoid or para- 
noiac and, more rarely, hypomanic patients can influence their immediate 
companions to such an extent that they join m believing m their delu- 
sions and copy their j r Susceptible associates begin to develop similar 
delusions and hallucinations and to pass through episodes themselves, 
perfectly oblivious to contradictions with external m o reality There 
are many paranoiac-like semantic epidemics of this kind on record It 
is instructive to visit some ‘meetings’ and watch the performer and the 
audience The pathetic side of it is that these performers, themselves not 
realizing the harmfulness of the situation, often pretend, or genuinely 
believe, that they are helping mankind by preaching some metaphysical 
‘morals’ What they actually produce is a disorganization of the survival- 
working of the human nervous system, particularly if they train the 
structurally undeveloped nervous system of children to delusional evalu- 
ations and sr, and, m general, make sanity and higher and effective 
ethical standards very difficult or impossible It is positively known that 
s r are inextricably connected with electrical currents, secretions of dif- 
ferent glands , which, in turn, exert a powerful influence on colloidal 
structure and behaviour, and so condition our neurological and physio- 
logical development There can be no doubt that imposing delusional 
j r on the undeveloped child must result in at least colloidal injury, which 
later on facilitates arrested development or regression, and, in general, 
leads away from adjustment and sanity 

Lack of space and the essentially constructue aims of the present 
system do not allow me to analyse many fundamental interrelations m 
the development of man, but a brief list, worthy of analysis, may be sug- 
gested • 

1) The relation between the pre-human reactions and the reactions 
of the primitive man, involving always some copying by mutants of the 
responses of the prevailing simpler organisms 

2) The interrelation between the reactions of the primitive man, 
his animism, anthropomorphism, his other sr and the structure of his 
language and semantics 

3) The relation between the structure of primitive languages and 
the structure of the ‘philosophical grammar’ formulated by Aristotle, 
generally called ‘logic’ 

4) The relation between this grammar, the structure of language, 
and the further development of our structural metaphysics and sr 



ON RELATIONS 


201 


5) The influence the last conditions exerted on the structure of 
our institutions, doctrines, and the j r related to them 

6) The relation between the ‘copying animals in our nervous pro- 
cesses’ and semantic blockages , preventing an adult civilization, agree- 
ment, sanity, and other desirable human reactions 

This brief list suggests an enormous field for further research, but, 
even now, the formulation of a y4-system of evaluations makes a few 
points clearer. 

An infant, be it primitive or modern, begins life ivith j r of identity 
and confusion of orders of abstractions, natural to his age, yet false in 
principle, and structurally false to fact At present, parents and teachers 
seldom check or counteract this tendency, mostly not realizing the impor- 
tance of this semantic factor and its role m the future adjustment of the 
individual In the rough, to a baby, his cry ‘is’ food Words ‘are’ magic 
This identification is structurally false to facts, but in babyhood it mostly 
works To the infant, experience proies that the noises he makes, a cry 
or a word, have the objectne value, — food The semantic identity of the 
symbol and the un-speakable object level, — food, — has been established 
This infantile attitude or jris carried on into grown-up life 

Under very simple conditions of primitn e peoples, in spite of many 
difficulties, this attitude of identification is not always checked by 
experience, and experimenting is non-existent at this stage If it is, then 
such checking of identification is ‘explained by some sort of demonology 
and ‘good’ or ‘evil’ ‘spirits’. Delusional, from the modern point of view, 
s r are compensated by mj’thologies, making the two sides of the semantic 
equation equivalent This equating tendency is jiiliereiit in all human sr 
It expresses the instinctive ‘feel’ for the similarity of structure as the 
base of ‘knowdedge’, and it ultimately finds its expression in mathematical 
equations In all psycho-logical processes of ‘understanding’, we must 
have some standards of evaluation and ‘equivalence’ On primitive levels, 
this is accomplished by literal identification and delusional mythology of 
the type, that a storm at sea is ‘caused’ by a violent quarrel between a 
‘god’ and his ‘wife’, or, in contemporaneous mjthology, a draught, or 
fire, or death by lightning, is explained as ‘punishment’ for ‘sins’,. 
Semantic compensation is needed and produced A similar semantic 
process produces scientific theories, but with different standards of eval- 
uation At present, scientific theories do not co\er all semantic needs and 
urges of mankind, owing to the prevailing false to fact identification of 
different orders of abstractions With the full consciousness of abstract- 
ing, which means proper evaluation or differentiation betw'een orders of 
abstractions, science will then cover all our non-pathological semantic 



202 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


needs, and different primitive mythologies will become unnecessary A 
very harmful, primitive, delusional semantic factor of blockages would 
be eliminated. 

The ‘is’ of identity plays a great havoc with our s r, as any ‘identity’ 
IS structurally false to fact An infant does not know and cannot know 
that In his life, the ‘is’ of identity plays an important semantic role, 
which, if not checked intelligently, becomes a pernicious semantic factor 
in his grown-up reactions, w'hich preserve the infantile character and 
with which adult adjustment and semantic health is impossible The 
infant begins to speak and again he is trained in the ‘is’ of identity 
Symbols are identified with the un-speakable actions, events and objects 
under penalty of pain or even death The magic of words begins its full 
sway As a rule, parental, crude disciplining of the infant, particularly 
m former days, trained the jr of the infant again in the delusional ‘is’ 
of identity The results are semantically and structurally very far- 
reaching and are found to underlie modern mythologies, militarism, the 
prevailing economic and social systems, the control by fear (be it ‘hell’ 
or machine guns), illusory gold standards, hunger, 

E.xperience shows that such identification of symbols with the 
un-speakable levels works very well with animals With man, it leads 
only to the misuse of the human nervous system, semantic disturbances 
of evaluation, and the prevailing unstable animalistic systems in practi- 
cally all fields, resulting in the general chaos in human affairs 

It should be noticed that the ‘is’ of predication also expresses a sort 
of partial identity, leading to primitive anthropomorphism and general 
confusion of orders of abstractions By an inherent necessity, our lives 
are lived on the un-speakable objective levels, w'hich include not only 
ordinary objects but also actions and immediate feelings, symbols being 
only auxiliary means The natural ordinal evaluation, which should be 
the foundation for healthy sr, appears as the event-process level first, 
the object next in importance, the objective level first, the sjmbolic next 
in importance , the descriptive level first, the inferential level next in 
importance , The semantic identification of these different levels not only 
abolishes the natural evaluation, but, in fact, reverses the natural order 
Once this is realized, we see clearly that all statements about the objec- 
tive level, which is made up of absolute individuals, are only probable in 
different degrees and can nev er be certain The ‘is’ of identity underlies, 
also, the two-valued, too primitive, too restricted, and structurally 
fallacious A ‘logic’. 

The crucial semantic importance of asymmetrical relations becomes 
obvious when we consider that all evaluation and non-el meanings 



ox RELATIONS 


203 


depend ultimately on asiTumetrical relations. In the technical fields, 
mathematics and the exact sciences, in the semi-scientific fields, eco- 
nomics, politics, sociology- , in the as jet non-scientific fields, ‘ethics’, 
‘liappiness’, ‘adjustment’ , represent ultimately ditferent forms of ciu/na- 
tioii, impossible to formulate adequatelj- under aristoteiianism 

ObMously, a .^-sjstem based on proper semantic e\aluation leading 
to non-pathological reactions adjustments , must make relations and 
multi-dimensional order fundamental for sanitj- The semantic connec- 
tion between mathematical methods and all the other concerns of man 
becomes also necessary and ob\ lous 

In mathematics recently the notion of equality needed a refinement 
and the notion of ‘identity’ has been introduced The present anaUsis 
discloses that, although the refinement and tlie symbnl maj he retained, 
vet the name should be encirelj abandoned, because it conceals a \erj 
semanticallj vicious confusion of orders of abstractions It by definition, 
we produce neu terms, these new teniis are of a higher order abstraction 
than the terms used in the definition, and so the irfcnfi/icaffoii of them 
as to the orders of abstractions is physiologically and structurally false 
to facts 

The problems discussed in the present chapter have been felt 
taguely for more than two thousand tears and found their first histor- 
ical expression in the rift betu een Aristotle the biologist and Plato, the 
founder of mathematical philosophj- ilathematics is in principle .-7, 
and so in the studj' of mathematics we can learn most about the princi- 
ples of non-aristotelianism In phj'sics, only verj' recently, do we begin 
to eliminate the ‘is’ of identitj' and elementalism which resulted in the

CHAPTER XIV 


ON THE NOTION OF INFINITY 


The questions on which there is disagreement are not trivialities, they 
are the very roots of the whole vast tree of modern mathematics (22) 

E T BELL 

The task of cleaning up mathematics and salvaging whatever can be 
saved from the wreckage of the past twenty years will probably be enough 
to occupy one generation (22) E T bell 

The intention of the Hilbert proof theory is to atone by an act performed 
once for all for the continual titanic offences which mathematics and all 
mathematicians have committed and will still commit against mind, against 
the principle of evidence, and this act consists of gaining the insight that 
mathematics, if it is not true, is at least consistent Mathematics, as we 
saw, abounds in propositions that are not really significant judgments 

(549) HERMANN WEYL 

An objectivated property is usually called a set in mathematics (S49) 

HERMVNN WEYL 

If the objects are indefimte in number, that is to say if one is constantly 
exposed to seeing new and unforseen objects arise, it may happen that the 
appearance of a new object may require the classification to be modified, 
and thus it is %e are exposed to antinomies There ts no actual (given 
complete) infinity (417) H POiNCARfe 


The structural notion of 'infinite’, 'infinity', is of great semantic 
importance and lately has again become a subject of heated mathematical 
debates My examination of this subject is from the point of view of a 
/?-system, general semantic, and a theory of sanity which completely 
eliminates identification In Supplement III, I give a more detailed 
A anal) SIS of the problem already anticipated by Brouwer, Weyl, 
Chwistek, and others These problems are not yet solved, because 
mathematicians, in their orientations and arguments, still use el, A 
‘logic’, ‘psychology’, and epistemology, which involve and depend on 
the ‘is’ of identity, making agreement impossible 

Mathematical infinity was first put on record by the Roman poet, 
Titus Lucretius, who, as far back as the first century b c , wrote very 
beautifully about it in his De Reriim Natura ^ As the author was a poet, 
and his work poetry, a few privileged literati had great pleasure in read- 
ing it, but this discovery, not being rigorously formulated, remained 
inoperative, and so practically worthless for mankind at large, for 2000 
years Only about fifty years ago, mathematical infinity was rediscovered 
by mathematicians, who formulated it rigorously, without poetry Since 
then, mathematics has progressed with all other sciences in an unprece-

dented way That this structural linguistic discovery was made so late is 
probably due to the usual blockage, the old s r, old habits of ‘thought’, 
and prejudices. 

In all arguments about infinity, from remote antiquity until Bolzano 
(1781-184B), Dedekind (1831-1916), and Cantor (1845-1918), there 
was a peculiar maxim involved All arguments against infinity involved 
a certain structural assumption, which, at first inspection, seemed to be 
true and ‘self-evident’, and yet, if carried through, would be quite 
destructive to all mathematics existing at that date Arguments favorable 
to infinity did not involve these tragic consequences Quite naturally, 
mathematicians, and particularly Cantor, began to investigate this peculiar 
maxim and the j i which were playing havoc The structural assumption 
in question is that ‘if a collection is part of another, the one which is a 
part must have fewer terms than the one of which it is a part’ This j r 
was deeply rooted, and even found a scholarly formulation in Euclid’s 
wording in one of his axioms ‘The whole is greater than any of its 
parts’ This axiom, although it is not an exact equivalent of the maxim 
stated above, by loose reasoning, which was usual in the older days, could 
be said to imply the troublesome maxim It is not difficult to see that 
the E axiom, as well as our troublesome maxim, expresses a struc- 
tural generalization taken from experience which applies only to finite 
processes, arrays, Indeed, both can be taken as a definition of finite 
processes, arrays , It does not follow, how’ever, that the one definition 
and structure must be true of infinite processes, arrays , As a matter of 
fact, the break-dowm of this maxim gives us the precise definition of 
mathematical infinity. A process of generating arra> s , is called infinite 
when It contains, as parts, other processes, arraj's , which have ‘as many’ 
terms as the first process, array , 

The term ‘infinite’ means a process W'hich does not end or stop, and 
It IS usually symbolized by oo The term may be applied, also, to an 
array of terms or other entities, the production of which does not end 
or stop Thus we may speak of the infinite process of generating num- 
bers because every positive integer, no matter how great, has a successor ; 
we can also speak of infinite divisibility because the numerical technique 
gives us means to accomplish that The term ‘infinite’ is used here as an 
adjective describing the characteristics of a process, but should never be 
used as a noun, as this leads to self-contradictions The term ‘infinity’, 
as a noun, is used here only as an abbreviation for the phrase ‘infinite 
process of generating numberr’. If used in any other way than as an 
abbreviation for the full phrase, the term is meaningless in science (not 
in psychopathology) and should never be used The above semantic 



206 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


restrictions are not arbitrary or purely etymological, but they follow the 
rejection of the ‘is’ of identity of a ^-system 

Before we can apply the term ‘infinite’ to physical processes, we 
must first theoretically elucidate this term to the utmost, and only then 
find out by experiment whether or not we can discover physical pro- 
cesses to which such a term can be applied Fortunately, we have at our 
disposal a semantic process of generating numberj which, by common 
experience, by definition, and by the numerical technique, is such that 
every number has a successor Similarly, our semantic processes are 
capable by common experience, by definition, and by the numerical 
technique to divide a finite whole indefinitely Thus, if we do not identify 
external physical objective processes with internal semantic processes, 
but differentiate between them and apply correct symbolism, we can see 
our way clear If we stop this semantic process of generating numbers 
at any stage, then we deal with a finite number, no matter how great, 
yet the process remains, by common experience, by definition, and by the 
numerical technique, such that it can proceed indefinitely In the A 
sense, ‘infinite’, as applied to processes, means as much as ‘indefinite’ 
We should notice that the semantic process of generating numbers should 
not be identified with a selection of a definite number, which, by necessity, 
is finite, no matter how great. The identification of the semantic process 
of generating numbers with a definite number , the identification of the 
semantic process of infinite divisibility of finites in the direction of the 
small ivith the generating of numbers in the direction of the great, and 
the identification of semantic internal processes with external physical 
processes , are found at the foundation of the whole present mathemati- 
cal scandal, which divides the mathematical world into two hostile camps. 

The process of infinite divisibility is closely connected with the 
process of the infinite generation of numbers Thus we may have an 
array of numbers 1, 2, 3, n, all of which are finite The semantic 
process of passing from n to « -(- 1 ts not a number, but constitutes a 
characteristic of the semantic process The result oi the semantic process , 
namely, « -|- L again becomes a finite number If we take a fraction, a/n, 
the greater an n is selected, the smaller the fraction becomes, but with 
each selection the fraction again is finite, no matter how small 

Although the two processes are closely connected on the formal 
side, they are very different from the semantic point of view The process 
of generating numberj may be carried on indefinitely or ‘infinitely’ and 
has no upper limit, and we cannot assign such a limit without becoming 
tangled up m self-contradiction m terms Not so with the process of 
indefinite or infinite divisibility In this case, we start with a finite. 



ON THE NOTION OF INFINITY 


207 


Existing mathematical symbolism and formalism lead to identification 
of both fundamentally different semantic processes and introduce a great 
deal of a\oidable confusion A A orientation will allow us to retain 
mathematical symbolism and formalism, but will not allow the identifi- 
cation of the semantic process of passing from number to number, which 
passing IS not a number, with the result of this process which, in each 
case, becomes a definite and finite ninnbei 

It becomes ob\ious that the terminology and present standard 
notions of ‘number’ identify the semantic process with its result, an 
identification -which must ultimately be disastrous The semantic process 
IS thus potentially infinite, but the passing from n to » -j- 1 characterizes 
the semantic process, not number, numberj representing only finite 
results of the mdefinitelj extended semantic process 

A A analysis -without identification discloses, then, that only the 
semantic process can be indefinitely extended, but that the results of 
this process, or a number in each case, must be finite To speak about 
an ‘infinite’ or, as it is called, ‘transfinite’ ‘number’, is to identify entirely 
different issues, and imohes \er} definite self-contradictions in mo 
terms The existing mathematical terminology has been de\ eloped \\ ith- 
out the realization of A issues and the multiordmality of terms and 
leads automatically to such identifications As long as mathematicians 
do not consider A issues, the problems of mathematical infinity will 
remain unsolved and hopeless, and yet, without a scientific theory of 
infinity, all of mathematics and most of science would be entirely 
impossible A A clarification of these problems mvohes a new 
semantic definition of numbers and mathematics, gnen in Chapter 
XVIII, which eliminates a great many mysteries in connection with 
mathematics and does not allow these dangerous and befogging 
identifications 

From a A point of view', we must treat infinity in the fiist can- 
torian sense , namely, as a variable finite, the term variable pertaining 
to the semantic process but not to number, the term Unite pertaining to 
both the semantic arrest of the infinite semantic process, and so charac- 
terizing also Its result , namely — a number 

In the meantime, the numencal technique is indefinitely flexible in 
the sense that no matter how great a number we take we alwa\ s can, by 
a semantic process, produce a greater number, and no matter how small 
the difference between two numbers might be, w'e alwavs can find a 
third number which w'lll be greater than the smaller, and smaller than 
the given greater number Thus, we see that the numerical technique is 
such as to correspond in flexibility exactly to the semantic processes, but 



208 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


there is nothing flexible about a definite number once it is selected 
What has been already said about a variable applies, also, to a number , 
namely, that a ‘variable’ does not ‘vary’ in the ordinary sense , but this 
term applies only to the semantic processes of the mathematician The 
older intensional A definition of ‘number’ must have led to the older 
identifications The A, extensional, and non-el semantic definition of 
numberr does not allow such identifications. The A term ‘number’ 
applied to a definite number, but also to an intensional definition of 
numbers The A, or semantic definition of numbers, is different in 
the sense that it finds extensional characteristics of each number, applic- 
able to all numbers, and so helps not to identify a definite number 
with the process of generating numbers, which the use of one term for 
two entirely different entities must involve 

Cantorian alephs, then, are the result of identification or confusion 
of entirely different issues and must be completely eliminated The 
rejection of ale pits will require a fundamental revision of those branches 
of mathematics and physics which utilize them , yet, as far as I know, 
with a very few exceptions, the alephs are not utilized or needed, 
although the 'name’ is used, which spell-mark has become fashionable in 
many mathematical and physical circles In the case of alephs, history 
may repeat itself and the alephs, like the ‘infinitesimal’, when their 
self-contradictory character becomes understood, will be eliminated 
without affecting the great body of mathematics, but only the small 
portions which are built on the alephs. 

As to the existence of infinite processes, we know positively only 
about the semanhc process of generating numberj and the semantic 
process of infinite divisibility These processes are evident in our 
common experience We cannot a prion know if such infinite processes 
can be found in the world which must he discovered by investigation and 
experimentation 

The existing terminology is still A and is based on, and leads 
to, identification, and so in my A presentation I cannot use it and 
expect to clear up some of the issues involved The terms such as 
'class’, ‘aggregate’, ‘set’ , imply a definite static collection The term 
‘infinite’, in the meantime, can only be correctly and significantly used 
as applied to a dynamic semantic process We cannot speak of ‘infinite’ 
classes, aggregates, sets , and evade the issues of identification of 
entirely different entities The term ‘senes’ has a technical meaning in 
connection with numbers and so, for a general discussion of processes, 
is a little too specific The term ‘array’ is more general, yet extensional, 
of which ‘senes’ would be a special case. The general term ‘number’

IS multiordinal and intensional and so, in the A extensional system. 
00-valued, and must be used in the plural, namely, ‘numberj’ The 
term ‘number’ m the singular will be used to indicate a definite number 
The term ‘denumerable’ has been introduced by Cantor and means any 
extensional array of terms, facts, states, observables , which can be put 
in one-to-one correspondence with the infinite array of positive integers 
Let me repeat once more the semantic process may be carried on 
without limits, and the infinite series of positive integers is an exten- 
sional, technical, and verbal expression of this semantic process and the 
only infinite array of which existence we are certain 

We shall be able to explain, and to give a better definition of, 
mathematical infinity if we introduce an extremely useful structural 
term, ‘equivalence’ Two processes, arrays , between which it is possible 
to set up, by some law of transformation, a one-to-one correspondence 
are said to be equivalent A process, array , which is equivalent to a 
part of Itself, is said to be infinite. In other words, a process, array , 
which can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a part of itself 
IS said td be infinite We can define a finite process, array , (class, 
“Aggregate ,) as one which is not infinite The following is valid exclu- 
sively because of the use of the ‘etc.’ 

A few examples will make this definition clearer If we take the 
series of positive integers, 1, 2, 3, 4, . etc ., we can always double 

every number of this row provided we retain the process-character, but 
not otherwise Let us write the corresponding row of their doubles under 
the row of positive integers, thus 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . etc. 

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . etc. 

or we can treble them, or «-ble them, thus : 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...etc. 

3, 6, 9, 12, 15, . etc. 

there are obviously as many numbers m each row below as in the row 
above, provided we retain the ‘etc. ’, so the numberr of numbers in 
the two rows compared must be equal All numbers which appear m 
each bottom row also occur in the corresponding upper row, although 
they only represent a part of the top row, again provided that we retain 
the ‘etc.’ 

The above examples show another characteristic of infinite pro- 
cesses, arrays , In the first example, we have a one-to-one correspondence 
between the natural numberj and the even numberj, which are equal in 
number at each stage Yet, the second row results from the first row by 
14 



210 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


taking away all odd numbers, which, itself, represents infinite numberi 
of number j. 

This example was used by Leibnitz to prove that infinite arrays 
cannot exist, a conclusion which is not correct, since he did not realize 
that both finite and infinite arrays depend on definitions We should be 
careful not to approach in finite processes, arrays , with prejudices, or 
silent doctrines and assumptions, or, m general sr, taken over from 
finite processes, arrays , 

Thus we see that the process of generating natural numbers is 
structurally an infinite process because its results can be put m a one-to- 
one correspondence with the results of the process of generating even 
numbers , which is only a part of itself Similarly, a line AB has 
infinitely many points, since its points can be put into a one-to-one 
correspondence with the points on a segment CD of AB Another 
example can be given in the Tristram Shandy paradox of Russell. 
Tristram Shandy was writing his autobiography, and was using one 
year to write the history of one day The question is, would Shandy 
ever complete his biography^ He would, provided he never died, or he 
lived infinite numberj of years The hundredth day would be written in 
the hundredth year, the thousandth m the thousandth year, etc. No 
day of his life would remain unwritten, again provided his process of 
living and wnting would never stop 

Such examples could be given endlessly. It is desirable to give one 
more example which throii s some light on the problems of ‘probability’, 
‘chance’. The theory of probability originated through consideration of 
games of chance Lately it has become an extremely important branch 
of mathematical knowledge, with fundamental structural application m 
physics, general semantics, and other branches of science For instance, 
Boltzman based the second law of thermodynamics on considerations of 
probability Boole's ‘laws of thought’, and the many-valued ‘logic’ of 
Lukasiewicz and Tarski are also closely related to probability, and the 
new quantum mechanics uses it constantly , 

The term ‘probability’ may be defined in the rough as follows If 
an event can happen in a diflFerent ways, and fails to happen in b differ- 
ent ways, and all these ways are equally likely to occur, the probability of 

the happening of the event is — - — , and the probability of its failing

Let us assume that in a certain city a lecture is held each day, and 
that, though the listeners may change each day, the numbers of listeners 



ON THE NOTION OF INFINITY 


211 


are always equal Suppose that one in each twenty inhabitants of this 
town has M as the first letter of his name What is the probability that, 
‘by chance’, all the names of the audience would begin with M ^ Let us 
call such a happening the M-event In the simplest case, when the daily 
number of listeners is only one, the probability of an IM-event is 1 in 20, 
or 1/20 The probability of an M-event for an audience of 2 is 1 in 
20 X 20 = 400, or 1/400 The probability that an audience of three 
members should have all three names begin with M would decrease 
twenty times further Only once m 8000 lectures, on an average, m ould 
an M-event happen For five people it would amount to 1 in 20 X 20 X 
20 X 20 X 20 = 3,200,000 days, or 1/3,200,000. or once in approxi- 
mately 9000 years, for ten people, about once in thirty billion years , 
for twenty people, about once in a third of a quadrillion years For one 
hundred people, the recurrence period of the M-event would be given 
as once in a number of years represented by more than a hundred figures 
If the town, in this last example, should be as old as the solar system, and 
if the lectures had been delivered daily to an audience of one hundred 
people through this inconceivably long period, the probability is ex- 
tremely small that the M-event would happen at all ^ 

From the human, anthropomorphic, point of view, we would say 
that such an event is impossible But it must be remembered that this is 
only an anthropomorphic point of view, and our judgements are coloured 
by the temporal scale of our own lives Of course, to carry such an 
anthropomorphic viewpoint into cosmic speculations is simply silly, a 
survival of the primitive structure of language and its progeny — meta- 
physics and mythologies 

The theory of infinity throws considerable structural light on such 
primitive speculations In this external world, we deal with processes, 
and, as we measure ‘length’ by comparison with freely selected conve- 
nient units of ‘length’, let us say, an inch, or we measure ‘volume’ by 
freely selected convenient units of ‘volume’, so, also, vve compare pro- 
cesses with some freely selected and convenient unit-process The diurnal 
rotation of our earth is such a process, and, if vve choose, vve can use it 
as a measuring unit or as a comparison standard Of late, vve have 
become aware that the rotation of the earth is not quite regular, and so. 
for accurate measurements, the old accepted unit-process of a day, or its 
subdivision, a second, is not entirely satisfactory For scientific purposes, 
we are trying to find some better unit-process, but vve have difficulty, as 
the problem is naturally circular When vve speak m terms of a ‘number 
of years’, or of seconds, vv^e speak about perfectly good observational 
experimental facts, about quite definite relations, the best we know in

1933. We do not make any metaphysical assertions about ‘time’ and we 
should not be surprised to find that statements involving ‘years’ are 
generally propositions, but that statements involving ‘time’ often are not 
It IS necessary not to forget this to appreciate fully what follows 

The theory of infinity will clear away a troublesome stumbling- 
block We will use the expression ‘infinite numberj of years’, remember- 
ing the definition of ‘infinite numberi’ and what was said about the 
umt-proccss which we call a year We have seen in an example above 
that if only a hundred individuals attend a lecture, and all ‘by chance’ 
hai e their names begin with M, such an event happens, on an average, 
only once in an inconceivably large number of years, represented by a 
number with a hundred figures If w'e would ask how many times an 
occurrence would happen, we would have to state the period m years for 
which we ask the how many. It is easy to see that in infinite numberi 
of years, this humanly extremely rare occurrence would happen precisely 
tnfimte minthers of times, or, in other words, ‘just as often’, this last 
statement being from a non-anthropomorphic point of view An event 
that appears, from our human, limited, anthropomorphic point of view, 
as ‘rare’, or as ‘chance’, when transposed from the level of finite process, 
arrays , to that of infinite processes, arrays . , is as ‘regular’, as much a 
‘law’, involving ‘order’, as anything else It is the old primitive j r to 
suppose that man is the only measure of things 

Here the reader might say that infinite numbers of years is a rather 
large assumption to be accepted so easily This objection is indeed 
serious, but a method which can dispose of it is given later on At this 
stage, it is sufficient to say that, on the one hand, this problem is con- 
nected with the semantic disturbance, called identification (objectifica- 
tion of ‘time’), which afflicts the majority of us, excepting a few 
younger einsteinists , and that, on the other hand, it involves the struc- 
turally reformulated law of the ‘conservation of energy’, ‘entropy’. 

Before parting with the problem of infinity, let me say a word about 
the notion of ‘continuity’, which is fundamental m mathematics Mathe- 
matical continuity is a structural characteristic connected with ordered 
series The difficulties originated in the fact that a ‘continuous’ series 
must have infinite numberj of terms between any two terms Accord- 
ingly, these difficulties are concerned with infinity That mathematicians 
need some kind of continuity is evident from the example of two inter- 
secting lines If the lines have gaps, as, for instance, , 

there would be the possibility that two gaps w'ould coincide, and the two 
lines not intersect , although in a plane the first line would pass to the 
other side of the second line At present, we have two kinds of ‘con- 



ON THE NOTION OF INFINITY 


213 


tmuity’ used in mathematics One is a supposedly ‘high-grade’ continuity ; 
the other, supposedly, is a ‘low-grade’ continuity, which is called ‘com- 
pactness’ or ‘density’, with the eventual possibility of gaps I am pur- 
posely using rather vague language, since these fundamental notions are 
now being revised, with the probability that we shall have to be satisfied 
with ‘dense’ or ‘compact’ series and abandon the older, perhaps delu- 
sional, ‘high-grade’ continuity It is interesting to note that the differ- 
ential and integral calculus is supposedly based on the ‘high-grade’ 
continuity, but the calculus will not be altered if we accept the ‘low- 
grade’ compactness, all of which is a question of an A or A orientation 
Vague feelings of ‘infinity’ have pervaded human sr as far back as 
records go Structurally, this is quite natural because the term infinity 
expresses primarily a most important semantic process The majority of 
our statements can also be reformulated m a language which explicitly 
involves the term ‘infinity’ An example has been already given when we 
were speaking about the universal propositions which were supposed to 
be of permanent validity, in other language, valid for ‘infinite numbers 
of years’ We see how the trick is done — a vague quasi-qualitative 
expression like ‘permanent’ or ‘universal’ is translated into a quantitative 
language in terms of ‘numbers of years’ Such translation of qualitative 
language into quantitative language is very useful, since it allows us to 
make more precise and definite the vague, primitive structural assump- 
tions, which present enormous semantic difficulties This brings to our 
attention more clearly the structural facts they supposedly state, and aids 
analysis and revision In many instances, such translations make obvious 
the illegitimacy of the assumptions of ‘infinite velocities’ and so clear 
away befogging misunderstandings, and beneficially affect our s.r. 



CHAPTER XV 


THE ‘INFINITESIMAL’ AND ‘CAUSE AND EFFECT’ 


But we are not likely to find science returning to the crude form of 
causality believed in by Fijians and philosophers, of which the type is 
“lightning causes thunder ” (457) bertrand russell 

The notion of causality has been greatly modified by the substitution of 
space-time for space and time . Thus geometry and causation becomes 
inextricably intertwined (4S7) bertrand russell 

In classical mechanics, and no less in the special theory of relativity, 
there is an inherent epistemological defect which was, perhaps for the first 
time, clearly pointed out by Ernst Mach No answer can be admitted 
as epistemologically satisfactory, unless the reason given is an observable 
fact of experience The law of causality has not the significance of a state- 
ment as to the world of experience, except when observable facts ultimately 
appear as causes and effects (155) A einstein 

The chain of cause and effect could be quantitatively verified only if 
the nhole universe were considered as a single system — but then physics 
has vanished, and only a mathematical scheme remains The partition of 
the world into observing and observed system prevents a sharp formula- 
tion of the law of cause and effect (2is) w Heisenberg 

Of late, another perplexing semantic problem concerning ‘causality’ 
or ‘non-causality’ has arisen in connection with the newer quantum 
mechanics It is possible to examine this question by different methods 
The simpler one is connected with vague feelings of ‘infinity’ and its 
supposed opposite, the ‘infinitesimal’; the more fundamental method is 
based on the orders of abstractions leading toward the so -valued 
semantics of probability' 

Because of man’s natural tendency to speak in terms of ‘infinity’, 
and his further marked tendency' of having opposites, such as ‘y'es’, ‘nO’, 
‘right’, ‘left’, ‘positive’, ‘negative’, ‘love’, hate’, ‘honesty’, ‘dishonesty’ , 
quite naturally’ the notion of ‘infinity’ carried with it the tendency to 
invent the ‘infinitesimal’ Even mathematicians have had great semantic 
difficulties in breaking away from this habit Analysis persistently reveals 
that structurally no matter how far we go in div'iding something, let us 
say an inch, whatever is left may be extremely' small, but yet it is a per- 
fectly good fiiiife quantity Thus, structural difficulties were encountered 
with the postulated ‘infinitesimal’ The tiaine implies that they are not 
finite, yet analysis shows only finites Mathematicians supposed that an 
‘infinitesimal’ was necessary for mathematics, and so they were reluctant 
to abandon it 

The ‘infinitesimal’, like so many other baffling suppositions, was 
invented by the Greeks, who regarded a circle as differing ‘infinitesimally’ 

214 



‘INFINITESniAL’. ‘CAUSE’ AND ‘EFFECT’

from a polygon with a i ery large number of verj small equal sides, 
the invention of the differential and integral calculus, ‘infinitesimal cal- 
culus’, as it was called, the importance of the ‘infinitesimal’ increased, 
and even mathematicians used it as a fundamental notion Finally, 
Weierstrass succeeded in showing the meaningless character of the 
‘infinitesimal’, and also that the ‘infinitesimal’ was not structurally neces- 
sary for the calculus Up to tliat date, the problem was baffling, we 
knew that the calculus required ‘continuity’, which, in turn, seemed to 
require ‘the infinitely little’, and }et no one could tell what this 'infinitely 
little’ might represent It was quite obiiously not zero, because a suffi- 
cient number of them was able to make up a finite whole and we knew 
no fraction which was not zero and iiet not finite The discover}- by 
Weierstrass that the calculus does not require the ‘infinitesimal’, and 
that all deductions could be made without it, abolished a very senous 
structural verbal, metaphysical, and semantic bugaboo Common sense, 
of course, is much simpler, although unreliable in such matters, and 
was satisfied also 

The elimination of the ‘infinitesimal’ is a great semantic step for- 
ward, and helps to clarify structurally some deeply rooted vague, falla- 
cious notions, which are overloaded with affective components and are 
extremely vicious in their effects 

If there is no ‘infinitesimal’, there is no ‘next moment’, for the 
inten-al between an}- two moments must be finite, and so there are 
always other moments in the intenal between them Also, two moments 
cannot be consecutive, for between any two there are always other 
moments, no matter how far we go, siinilarh, the ‘present’ becomes a 
very vague notion 

For our purpose, the most fundamental semantic application of 
what has been said aboie is in the vast field embraced by the old struc- 
tural notions of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’. These terms are of great antiquity, 
of a distinctly pre-scientific one-, two-ialued semantic epoch They 
originated in the rough experience of our race, and are firmly rooted 
m the habits of ‘thought’ and the structure of our old tw-o-valued ‘logic’ 
and language, and because of that are even now- unduly baffling These 
terms, in the hjL'o-falttcd sen^e, were and are the structural assumptions 
of our ‘priiate’ and ‘official’ ‘philosophies’ The unenlightened use of 
these terms has done much to present the formulation of a science of 
man and to build up vicious anti-scientific metaphysics of various sorts 
invohing pathological sr With the new quantum mechanics, a better 
understanding of these notions, based on the cc-valued semantics of 
probabilit}', becomes a paramount issue for all science. In daily life, the 



216 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


indiscrirninate use of two-valued 'cause' and ‘effect’ leads structurally to 
a great deal of absolutism, dogmatism, and other harmful semantic 
disturbances, which I call confusion of orders of abstraction 

We usually follow the ‘philosophers’ and ascribe — or, rather feel, 
as conscious ascribing would not stand criticism — some mysterious struc- 
tural continuitj’’, some mysterious overlapping of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ We 
‘feel’, and try to ‘think’, about ‘cause and effect’ as contiguous in ‘time’ 
But ‘contiguous in time’ involves the impossible ‘infinitesimal’ of some 
unit of ‘time’ But, since we have seen that there is no such thing, we 
must accept that the interval between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ is finite This 
structural fact changes the whole situation If the interval between 
‘cause’ and ‘effect’ is finite, then always something might happen between, 
no matter how small the interval may be The ‘same cause’ would not 
produce the ‘same effect’. The expected result would not follow This 
means only that in this world, to be sure of some expected effect, requires 
that there must be nothing in the environment which can interfere with 
the process of passing from the conditions labelled ‘cause’ to the condi- 
tions labelled ‘effect’ In this world, with the structure which it has, we 
can never suppose that a ‘cause’, as we know it, is alone sufficient to 
produce the supposed ‘effect’ When we consider the ever-changing 
environment, the number of possibilities increases enormously If it were 
possible to take into account the whole of the environment, the probabil- 
ity that some event would be repeated, in all details, thus exhibiting 
the assumed two-valued relation of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’, which we took 
for granted in the old days, would practically be nil The principle of 
non-elementalism, as we see, requires an oo-valued semantics of 
probability 

The reader should not take what is said here as a denial that in this 
external world some regularities of sequence occur , but the above analy- 
sis, which IS mainly due to Russell,^ shows clearly that the verbal prin- 
ciple of ‘same cause, same effect’ is structurally untenable We can 
never manage to obserr e the ‘same cause’ m detail As soon as the ante- 
cedents have been sufficiently ascertained, so as to calculate the conse- 
quences with some plausible accuracy as to details, the relations of these 
antecedents have become so complex that there is very little probability 
that they vi ill ever occur again 

The clearing up of the problems of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ is of serious 
importance, because powerful semantic reactions are connected with it 
To begin with, we must differentiate between the terms ‘cause’ and 
‘effect’, which, linked together, imply a two-term relation nowhere to be 
found 111 this world, and thus represent a language and a two-valued 



‘INFINITESIMAL’, 'CAUSE’ AND ‘EFFECT’ 


217 


‘logic’ of a structure not similar to the structure of the world, and the 
general co-valucd notion of causality This last notion is the psycho- 
logical foundation of all explanations leading toward oo-valued determin- 
ism, and IS an exclusive test for structure , and so of extreme semantic 
importance 

Besides the analysis from the point of view of the impossible 
‘infinitesimal’, the term ‘cause-effect’ represents a two-term relation, 
and, as such, is a primitive generalization never to be found m this world, 
as all events are serially related m a most complex way, independent of 
our way of speaking about them If we expand our two-term relation 
‘cause-effect’ into a series, we pass from the inferential level to the 
descriptive level, and so can apply a behaviouristic, functional, actional 
language of order In such series, we could only use the language of 
‘cause’ and ‘effect’ if we could select neighbouring factors, a selection 
which IS often impossible Also, if we pass from macroscopic to micro- 
scopic or sub-microscopic levels, we could use such language, but then 
the terms would have different meanings, supplied by the theory of 
probability 

The semantic side of this problem is of importance, because, in the 
old el way, it was neglected General speculations about such in o terms 
as ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ are useless Such statements are not propositions, 
but involve variable meanings and, therefore, generate propositional 
functions which are neither true nor false Our expanding of the too 
simple, two-term relation ‘cause-effect’ into a complex series is closer to 
the structure of this world, as far as we know it 

The understanding and habitual application of what has just been 
said would not only save us from silly dogmatizing and inappropriate j r, 
but would teach us not to disregard any regularity, and to investigate 
any relation which might appear Then, in a specific case, we could again 
use the restricted principle of causality, based on probability and aver- 
ages The old absolute and objectified semantic attitude toward ‘cause- 
effect’ was and often is a serious hindrance m observing impartially the 
sequence of events (order) and relations Pieconceived notions and 
old j r played havoc, for it is well know n that we usually find ivhat we 
want to find If we approach a problem with definite unconscious 
‘emotional’ wants, and cannot satisfy these sr, ive become bewildered, 
down-hearted, and perhaps utter some such non-sense as the ‘finite mind’, 
or the like Under such semantic pressure, our power of observation and 
analysis is reduced by a kind of ‘emotional stupor’ Such an occurrence 
is harmful in science and m life ‘Human knowledge’ depends on human 
ingenuity, power of observation, power of abstraction , It is an activity 



218 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


of the human nervous system inside of our skin and can never be the 
events themselves. 

We see that the old two-\alued verbal structure of ‘cause’ and 
‘effect’ IS not similar to the structure of the world, but a rash limiting 
generalization from probability Since these expressions belong to the 
class of statistical a\erages and depend on the scale of the events and 
intervals dealt vith, we must not expect that such terms as two-valued 
‘causality’, nhich is a term of statistical macroscopic averages, will appl} 
in that sense to small-scale events when the intenals are much smaller 
and ivhen entirely different conditions and ‘causes’ prevail Today we 
have structural evidence that even ‘space’ and ‘time’ represent statistical 
averages and do not apply to the smallest scale events It is natural that 
‘cause’ and ‘effect’ should join their company The above involves epis- 
temologically the passing from the A tw'O-valued system to a A 
Qc-valued sjstem Psychophysiologically, it imohes new sr 

In mathematics, the old religious attitude toward the ‘infinitesimal’ 
is rapidly vanishing Many mathematicians deliberately, and justly, avoid 
the use of the word A term like ‘indefinitely small’ or ‘indefinitesimal’ 
is a better descriptive term, truer in its implications We even see scien- 
tists like Eddington, who had the pluck — it is still pluck, unfortunately — 
to treat enormous stellar distances as ‘infinitesimals of second order’ 
(‘Infinitesimal’ is used here in a mathematical sense of indefinitesimal ) 

It has been already mentioned that most of the important discov- 
eries of mathematics were due to a special semantic attitude on the part 
of those w ho made them This attitude was an unconscious or conscious 
treatment of mathematics as a form of human behaviour We see an 
example m the work of Weierstrass and his analysis of the ‘infinitesimal’ 
He did not take the ‘infinitesimal’ as some objectified metaphysical struc- 
ture and remain content , he analysed the genetic process by which the 
‘infinitesimal’ was wade by Smith and Browm, and so treated mathematics 
structurally as a form of human behaviour Any deepening of the foun- 
dations, or clarification of fundamental notions, or investigation of 
underlying assumptions , must, by necessity, have this cliaractenstic The 
man who does it must take into account how the given process w^as pro- 
duced — analyse its structure, and so start with the ways and methods of 
production In other words, he must treat the given problem as a form 
of human behaviour The fact that this simple and quite obvious method 
has been formulated and structurally explained as desirable is helpful 
It shows the method and structure of the path by w hich advances can be 
reached W’e can tram the semantic reactions of students to it and make 
progress inevitable , but now, instead, it takes a genius to break, by him-

self through the old semantic habits which have been produced by the 
lack of scientific psycho-logics and training 

The term ‘correct sjmbolism’ has already been used In this world 
of structurally absolute individuals, the minimum of structurally desir- 
able correct symbolism must provide for the possibility of labelling these 
absolute individuals by separate names For scientific purposes, we must 
use terms built on the pattern of mathematical S) mbolism , i e , accord- 
ing to the e vtensimial methods We must adopt a behaviouristic attitude 
and habits in our term-making. As we proceed, we must emphasize 
order, considering what comes first and what next This is semantically 
important, for the usual procedure is entirely different first, we have 
our structurally ‘preconceived’ doctrines and languages , next, vv e observ e 
the structure of the world, and then we try to force the observed 
facts into the linguistic structural patterns But, in the new way, we 
start with silent observations, and search empirically for structure , next, 
we invent verbal structures similar to them, and, finally, we see what 
can be said about the situation, and so test the language Experience 
shows that the old habits of labels first, objects next, instead of the 
structurally natural order of objects first, labels next, is semantically 
pernicious and harmful In Part VII, it is shown that the semantic 
structural reversal of the unnatural reversed order is crucial for sanity 
From the dajs of the Greeks an acute difficulty has made itself 
felt, namely, how to reconcile the world of physics with the world of 
mathematics For mathematics, we need ‘extensionless’ points , for 
physics, we need finite-sized elements Whitehead and Russell have 
suggested different structures by which this may be accomplished It 
seems possible to demand that none of the material dealt with sliall be 
smaller than an assigned finite size That this condition can be recon- 
ciled with mathematical continuity seems to be novel Whetlier this 
device is valid or not, it is yet too early to decide This problem of 
reconciliation will become important further on when we come to speak 
of events as made up from point-events.* 



CHAPTER XVI 


ON THE EXISTENCE OF RELATIONS 

We cannot choose to do without them, without seeking to choose, since 
choice IS action, and involves, for instance, the aforesaid difference between 
affirming and denying that we mean to do thus and thus (449) 

JOSIAH ROYCE 

In concluding the foregoing remarks, I must explain one more 
general consideration This concerns an extremely profound structural 
psycho-logical discovery, made by Prof Royce,^ which underlies any and 
all semantic problems of human ‘mentality’ Royce, although a ‘philoso- 
pher’, was a lover of mathematics and was much interested in the prob- 
lems of order He was trjmg to reformulate ‘logic’ in terms of order 
We had already encountered the inherent circularity in the structure of 
human knowledge, which admittedly is semantically disconcerting if not 
faced boldly. But, when recognized, this circularity is not only not 
vicious, but even adds to the interest and beauty of life and makes 
science more interesting Besides, the structure of human knowledge is 
such that there are activities of man which are not only circular but also 
‘absolute’, or ‘necessary’ Whatever we do, we cannot get away from 
them — a fact of serious semantic importance Except from Royce and a 
few of his students, these problems have as yet received little attention. 

Royce shows that there are certain activities which we reinstate and 
verify through the very fact of attempting to assume that these forms of 
activity do not exist, or that these laws are not \alid If any one attempts 
to say that there are no classes wdiatsoever in his world, he thereby 
inevitably classifies If any one denies the existence of relations, and, 
in particular, a semantic relation between affirmation and denial, or 
affirms that ‘3'es’ and ‘no’ have oue meaning, in that breath he affirms and 
denies He makes a difference between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, and emphatically 
asserts relational equivalence even m denying the -difference between 
‘yes’ and ‘no’ To use Royce’s own remarkable words ‘In brief, what- 
ever actions are such, w^hatever types of action are such, w'hatever 
results of activity, whatever conceptual constructions are such, that the 
very act of getting rid of them, or of thinking them away, logically im- 
plies their presence, are known to us indeed both empirically and prag- 
matically (since we note their presence and learn of them through 
action) , but they are also absolute And any account which succeeds in 
telling what they are has absolute truth Such truth is a ‘‘construction”

or “creation”, for activity determines its nature It is “found", for we 
observe it when w e act ’ 

We see that we have definite semantic guides in this enquiry One 
guide to follow IS these unescapable characteristics of the structure of 
human knowledge, which Royce called ‘absolute’, but which I prefer to 
call ‘necessary’. The other guide leads us to avoid ‘impossible’ or absurd 
statements, or statements which have no ‘logical existence’ , which, m the 
rough, means statements which abuse symbolism and produce noises , 
instead of symbols As we have already seen, both guides have sound 
neurological justification, to be expressed m terms of order and circu- 
larity, terms uniquely fit structurally to speak about processes, stages of 
processes, orders of abstractions , Obviously, our task of formulating a 
theory of sanity can proceed along these structural and semantic lines 
It should be noticed that mathematics, considered as a form of human 
behaiiour, and ‘mental’ illnesses, also considered as definitely human 
behaviour, ha\e yielded their share for our structural guidance 

Although many a scientist has instinctively proceeded in the way 
indicated, yet the instinctive successful procedure of an isolated scien- 
tist is usually not capable of being transmitted to others. It is his personal 
benefit Only a methodological structural formulation of such private 
routes to semantic success can become a public fact, to be analysed, 
criticized, improved, and transmitted or rejected 

It must be noticed that terms like ‘chance’ or ‘law’ are fundamentally 
connected with discussions of determinism versus indeterminism, and so 
involve problems in connection with ‘necessary’ semantic processes In 
the example about the probability of the M-event, it was shown how 
a ‘chance’ event on one level may become a ‘law’ on another The struc- 
tural possibility of such transformations is \ ery interesting and of basic 
semantic importance For scientific purposes, W'e must accept co-valued 
determinism on the scientific level as it is the test of structure, but this 
has nothing to do with the apparent, mostly two-valued indeterminism in 
our daily lives To solve a number of equations, we must have as many 
equations as we have unknowns If we have fewer equations than 
unknowns, we do not get definite values , our unknow ns are still undeter- 
mined The origin of ‘indeterminism’ is similar , w'e lack knowledge ; the 
numjier of equations is less than the number of unknowns Hence, it is 
impossible to discover determined values m all cases This gives an 
appearance of two-valued indeterminism, but with the increase of our 
knowledge, or with additional equations, the unknown may be deter- 
mined Determinism is a more fundamental point of view than indeter- 
minism , in it we find a test for structure It is also a more general point 



222 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


of view, in which indetenninism is only a particular case and does not 
allow of the structural test In a science of man. in a .(^-system, we 
must start with the more fundamental and general Accordingly, we 
have to accept x-valued determinism, w'hich, m 1933, becomes the broad 
scientific point of view The unnecessary semantic war between the 
adtocates of the different points of view' has been unduly bitter and 
necessarily futile 

As words are not the things we speak about, and the only link is 
structural, the ‘human mind’ must require linguistic structural x -valued 
determinism as a condition of rationality As soon as we find that any 
linguistic issues are not deterministic, it is an unmistakable sign that 
the language or the ‘logic’ we are usmg is not similar in structure to the 
empirical w orld and so should be changed 

This statement seems to be general In application to the new 
quantum mechanics’ special problem, it would appear that the old macro- 
scopic language of ‘space’, ‘time’ , is not similar to the sub-microscopic 
structure and should, therefore, be changed. Perhaps the electrodynamic 
language, instead of the macro-mechanistic, would fare better. 



CHAPTER XVII 


ON THE NOTIONS OF ‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


Common sense starts with the notion that there is matter where we can 
get sensations of touch, but not elsewhere Then it gets puzzled by wind, 
breath, clouds, etc , whence it is led to the conception of “spirit" — I speak 
etymologically After “spirit” has been replaced by “gas,” there is a 
further stage, that of the aether (4S7) bertrand russell 

The supposition of common sense and naive realism, that we see the 
actual physical object, is very hard to reconcile with the scientific new 
that our perception occurs somewhat later than the emission of light by the 
object, and this difficulty is not overcome by the fact that the time in- 
volved, like the notorious baby, is a very little one (4S7)

Section A Structural considerations. 

The facts at hand in 1933 show that the language we use for the 
purpose of describing events is not the events , the representation sym- 
bolizes what IS going on inside our skins , the events are outside our 
skins and structural similarity is the only link between them His.orically, 
as a race, we learned sooner and more about the events outside our 
skins than about the events inside our skins, just as a fish or a dog 
‘knows’ a lot about his world, lives sometimes happily and abundantly, 
and yet ‘knows’ nothing about biology, or physiology, or psycho-logics 
Only recently did we begin to study ourselves scientifically At some 
stage of our development, we introduced structurally simple forms of 
representation, such as a language of subject-predicate, of additivity,. 
We are still perplexed when we find that the events outside our skins 
cannot be pressed into schemes which are manufactured inside our skins. 
Our nervous system, with its ordered and cyclic structure and function, 
manufactures abstractions of different orders, which have quite distinct 
structure and different characteristics On different levels, we manu- 
facture different abstractions, dynamic and static, continuous and discon- 
tinuous , which have to take care of our needs If the verbal schemes we 
invent do not fit structurally the world around us, we can always invent 
new schemes of new structure which will be more satisfactory It is 
not a problem of the world around us, for our words cannot change that, 
but of our ingenuity In the meantime, we learn something very impor- 
tant, namely, about the world’s structure, which is the only content 
of knowledge 

There are good structural reasons why the world should, or should 
not, be accounted for in terms of differential equations, or in terms and 
language of ‘causality’. The term order is structurally fundamental and 
will help us in a radical and constructive way, in our quest 

First, however, we will investigate some further semantic problems, 
remembering that a theory of sanity, which means a theory of adjust- 
ment, should emphasize the methodological and structural means for 
such semantic adjustment The dynamic-static translations are funda- 
mentally connected with different orders of abstractions and involve 
psycho-logical issues connected with ‘emotions’ and ‘intellect’, linearity 
versus non-lmearity, ‘straight’ versus ‘curved’ , explained m Parts VII 
and VIII 

In life, as well as m science, we deal with different happenings, 
objects, and larger or smaller bits of materials We have a habit of 
speaking about them in terms of ‘matter’ Through a semantic disturb- 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


225 


ance, called identification, we fancy that such a thing as ‘matter’ has 
separate physical existence It would probably be a shock to be invited 
seriously to give a piece of ‘matter’ (give and not burst into speech) I 
have had the most amusing experiences in this field. Most people, scien- 
tists included, hand over a pencil or something of this sort. But did they 
actually give ‘matter’? What they gave is not to be symbolized simply 
‘matter’ The object, ‘pencil’, which they handed, requires linguistically 
‘space’ , otherwise, there would be no pencil but a mathematical point, a 
fiction It also requires verbally ‘time’, otherwise, there would be no 
pencil but a ‘flash’. 

Similarly, if any one is invited to give a piece of ‘space’ (again give 
It, and not burst into speech), the best he could do would be to wave 
his hand and try to show ‘space’ But the waving of the hand referred 
to what we call air, dust, microbes, gravitational and electromagnetic 
fields , In other words, structurally, the supposed ‘space’ was fulness of 
some materials already ‘in space’ and ‘in time’ 

In the case of giving ‘time’, one could shozv his watch A similar 
objection holds, also, namely, that he has shown us so-called ‘matter’ 
which IS ‘moving’ in ‘space’ It is very important to acquire the s r that 
when we use the term ‘matter’ we refer to something, let us say, the 
pencil, which, according to the accepted el language, also ini olves ‘space’ 
and ‘time’, which we disregard. When we use the term ‘space’, we 
refer to a fulness of some materials, u hich exists m ‘time’ But because 
these materials are usually invisible to the ‘senses’, we again disregard 
them In using the term ‘time’, we refer to ‘matter’ moving m ‘space’, 
which again we disregard 

What is said here and what will follow is structurally uncondi- 
tionally fundamental for a theory of sanity, because in most cases of 
‘insanity’ and un-sanity, there is a disorientation as to ‘space’ and ‘time’. 
In identification, the semantic disturbance which affects nearly all of us, 
and IS at the foundation of the majority of human difficulties, private or 
public, there invariably appears a special semantic disorientation in our 
feelings toward ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ This is only natural, for 
the ‘insane’ and un-sane are the unadjusted , the ‘sane’ are the supposedly 
adjusted 

Adjusted to what? To the world around us and ourselves Our 
human world differs from the world of animals It is more complex and 
the problems of human adjustment become also more subtle In animal 
life, attitudes toward the world do not matter in a similar sense, with 
us, they become important , hence the need of analysis of the new human 
‘semantic universe’, which involves the ‘universe of discourse’. This 

3.5 



226 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 

‘universe of discourse’ is strictly connected with the terms of ‘matter’, 
‘space’, and ‘time’, structure, and our semantic attitude toward these 
terms. 

Let us return to the analysis of our object which we call the ‘pencil’ 
We have seen that the object pencil %s not ‘matter’, nor ‘space’, nor 
‘time’ A question arises, which has been asked very often and has nevei, 
to my knowledge, been answered satisfactorily ‘ what ‘is’ the object 
pencil, and what ‘are’ the terms ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ ? Here and 
there some one has given fragments of answers or some satisfactory 
detached statements But in every case I know, the semantic disturb- 
ance called identification appears, and so even the casual correct answer 
IS not applied but remains enmeshed in some other identifications I have 
spent much ‘time’ and labour m overcoming my own identifications, and 
now confront the situation that nearly every work I read from this point 
of view cannot be criticized, but requires rewriting. This task is impos- 
sible for me, technically and otherwise So, finally, I decided to formu- 
late the present .<d-system, and then see what kind of reconstruction 
can be accomplished with the new evaluation 

The answer to the questions set above is childishly simple, yet I 
will carry it all through and let the semantic consequences speak for 
themselves The chunk of nature, the specially shaped accumulation of 
materials , which we call a pencil, ‘is’ fundamentally and absolutely 
tin-speakablej simply because whatever we may say about it, is not it We 
may write with this something, but we cannot write with its name or the 
descriptions of this something So the object is not words It is impor- 
tant that the reader be entirely convinced at this point, and it requires 
some training, performed repeatedly', before we get our sr adjusted to 
this simple fact Our statement had two parts One was rather unprom- 
ising, namely, that the object was absolutely un-speakable, because no 
amount of words will make the object The other was more promising, 
for we learned an extremely important, perhaps crucial, semantic fact ; 
namely, uhat the object pencil is not, namely, that the object is not 
zuords We must face here an important semantic fact If we are told 
that we cannot get the moon, we stop worrying about it, and we regard 
any dream about getting the moon as an infantile phantasy In this 
example, we could not c\en say that such news as the impossibility of 
getting the moon was sad, or unpleasant, news We might say so, 
jokingly, to an infant, but the majority of the grown-ups would not 
have their s r perturbed by it A similar situation arises with the object 
called pencil The object is not words There is nothing sad or depress- 
ing about this fact We accept it as a fact and stop worrying about it, as 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE', ‘TIME’ 


227 


an infant would The majority of the old ‘philosophical’ speculations 
about this subject belong to the semantic period of our infancy, when 
we live in phantasies and structurally gamble on words to which we 
alTectively ascribe objectne existence. This represents full-fledged 
un-sanity due to identification The answer to the question, wdiat ‘are’ 
the terms ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’, is, as usual, gncii in the pinpeily 
formulated question Thct ‘are’ terms, — ‘Modi ccrnsideraiidi , as Leibnitz 
called them without fully realizing the semantic importance of his own 
statement Incidentally, it must be noticed that it was the psycho-logical 
characteristic of Leibnitz who was capable of such a statement, that 
was probably respon>«ible for his whole work, as wall become more 
apparent later on When we abandon primitive standards of evaluation, 
geniuses will be made by a semantic education which relieves the race 
from the older blockages 

So we see clearly that outside of our skins there is something going 
on, which zee call the world, or a pencil, or anything, which is indepen- 
dent of our words and which is not words Here we come across a very 
fundamental irreversible process. Wc can say that m this world a man 
and his words have happened There is a ‘causal’ eventual complex 
series between the world, us, and our words, but in unaided nature this 
process is, in the main, irreversible, a fact unknown to primitives who 
believe m the magic of words Through our ingenuity we can make this 
process partially reversible, namely, we can produce giamophones, tele- 
phones in all their developments electromechanical men who obey 
orders , . 

We know in 1933 that in the semantic world this process is dra- 
matically effective Words are the result of the activity of one organism, 
and they, in turn, activate other organisms On the macroscojiic level of 
ordinary behaviour, this last was known long ago, but only in the last 
few years has psychiatry discovered what kind of semantic and psycho- 
physiological disasters words and their consequences may produce in the 
human organism These last are already on sub-microscopic levels, not 
obvious and, therefore, only recently discovered 

The structure of the language of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ is 
ancient The primitive saw something, ate something, was hurt by some- 
thing, Here was an occasion for a grunt of satisfaction, or of pain 
The equivalents of words like ‘matter’, substance’ , originated Neither 
he, nor the majority of us realized that the small or large bits of mate- 
rials we deal with appear as e.xtremely complex processes (explained in 
Part X) For him, as for most of us. these bits of materials ‘are’ ‘con- 
crete’, whatever that means, and he might know ‘all about them’, which 



228 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


must have led to identifiration , and other delusional evaluations Of 
course, these were phantasies of human infancy, and, in lives lived in a 
world of phantasies, adjustment, and, therefore, sanity, is impossible 
Since he did not see or feel, or know about the material he was im- 
mersed m, the fulness he was living in, he invented the term ‘space’, or 
Its equivalent for the tmnstble materials which were present Knowing 
nothing of fulness, he objectified what appeared to him to be empty 
‘space’ into ‘absolute emptiness’, which later became ‘absolute space’, 
‘absolute nothingness’, by ‘definition’. 

There are several important remarks which can be made about 
this ‘absolute emptiness’ and ‘absolute nothingness’ First of all, we now 
know, theoretically and empirically, that such a thing does not exist 
There may be more or less of something, but never an unlumted ‘perfect 
vacuum’ In the second place, our nervous make-up, being in accord 
with experience, is such that ‘absolute emptiness’ requires ‘outside walls’ 
The question at once arises, is the world ‘finite’ or ‘infinite’ ? If we say 
‘finite’. It has to have outside walls, and then the question arises • What 
IS ‘behind the walls’ ^ If we say it is ‘infinite’, the problem of the psycho- 
logical ‘walls’ IS not eliminated, and we still have the semantic need for 
walls, and then ask what is beyond the walls So we see that such a 
world suspended in some sort of an ‘absolute void’ represents a nature 
agatnst human jtature, and so we had to invent something supernatural 
to account for such assumed nature against human nature In the third 
place, and this remark is the most fundamental of all, because a symbol 
must stand for something to be a symbol at all, 'absolute nothingness’ 
cannot be objective and cannot be symbolized at all This ends the argu- 
ment, as all we may say about it is neither true nor false, but non-sense 
We can make noises, but say nothing about the external world It is easy 
to see that ‘absolute nothingness’ is a label for a semantic disturbance, 
for verbal objectification, for a pathological state inside our skin, for a 
fancy, but not a symbol, for a something which has objective existence 
outside our skin 

Some other imaginary consequences of this semantic disturbance 
are far-fetched and very gloomy If our world and all other worlds 
(island unnerses) were somehow suspended in such an ‘absolute void’, 
these universes would radiate their energy into this ‘infinite void’, what- 
ever that means, and so sooner or later would come to an end. their 
energy being exhausted But, fortunately, when we eliminate this 
pathological semantic state by proper education all these gloomy symp- 
toms vanish as mere fancies It must be noticed that this ‘absolute space’, 
‘absolute void’, ‘absolute nothingness’ with its difficulties, which are due 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


229 


to very primitive structural speculations on words, and to some un-sane 
ascribing of objectivity to words, can be abolished quite simply if we 
decide to investigate and re-educate our r r 

What we know positively about ‘space’ is that it is not ‘emptiness’, 
but ‘fulness’, or a ‘plenum’. Now ‘fulness’ or a ‘plenum’, first of all, is 
a term of entirely different non-el structure When we have a plenum 
or fulness, it must be a plenum of ‘something’, ‘somewhere’, at ‘some 
time’, and so the term implies, at least, all three of our former elemen- 
tahslic terms Furthermore, fulness by some psycho-logical process does 
not require ‘outside walls’ If we ask if such a universe of fulness is 
‘finite’ or ‘infinite’, without any psycho-logical difficulties, we may reply 
that we do not know, but if we study enough of the materials of this 
universe we may know A universe of fulness may be assumed to have 
boundaries, and then we may ask again the annoying question What is 
beyond? With the proper use of language, this difficulty is again 
eliminated 

Without going into unnecessary details, we see that a boundary, 
or a limit, or a wall, is something by defimtton, beyond which we cannot 
go If there is nothing to restrict our progress, there are no boundaries. 
Let us fancy some cosmic traveller with some extraordinary flying 
machine, and let us assume that he flies without stopping in a ‘definite 
direction’ If he never encounters any boundary, he is surely entitled to 
say that his universe is unbounded The question may arise Is such 
an unbounded universe finite or infinite in size? Again let us apply 
correct language and a little analogy A traveller on a sphere, like our 
own earth, could travel endlessly without ever coming to a boundary, 
and yet we know that the sphere, our earth, is of finite size Mathema- 
ticians have worked out this point, and it is embodied in the Einstein 
theory The universe is unbounded, an answer which satisfies our feel- 
ings , yet It IS finite in size, although very large, an answer which satisfies 
our rationality * The visualization of such a universe is quite difficult 
It should not be visualized as a sphere, but, at a later stage, we will see 
that it can be visualized satisfactorily The condition for visualization 
IS to eliminate identification, that semantic disturbance which is strictly 
connected with primitive ways of ‘thinking’. 

The problems of ‘time’ are similar, although they have a different 
neurological background The rough materials we deal with mostly 
affect our sight, touch , Invisible materials, like air. , affect these ‘senses’ 

*I do not introduce here the latest speculations in this field, because, from a 
non-anstotehan point of view, they appear meaningless 



230 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


less, but more the kinesthetic ‘senses’ by which muscular movements are 
appreciated, and so 'space' and ‘time’ have different neurological back- 
grounds ‘Time’ seemingly represents a general characteristic of all 
nemous tissue (and, perhaps, hving tissue m general) connected with 
summarizing or integrating What we have to deal with m this world 
and in ourselves appears as periods and periodicity, pulsations , We are 
made up of very long chains of atomic pulsating clocks, on the sub- 
microscopic lei el On the macroscopic level, w'e have also to deal with 
periodic occurrences, of hunger, sleep, breathing, heart-beats. We 
know already that, beyond some limits, discontinuous timer, w hen rapid 
enough, are blended into continuous feelings of pressure, or warmth, 
or light. On objectiie levels we deal with timer, and we feel ‘time’, 
when the timer are rapid enough 

Again, the moving pictures are a good illustration. The normal 
mo-v mg-picture film show s sixteen pictures a second The film gives us 
static pictures with finite differences When we put it on the projector, 
the differences vanish Our nervous system has summarized and inte- 
grated them, and we see ‘continuous motion’ If pictures are taken at the 
rate of eight a second and then run on the normal projector for the 
speed of sixteen a second, we summarize and integrate again, but we 
see a fast moving picture If the pictures are taken at the rate of 128 
exposures a second and run on the normal projector of sixteen pictures 
to a second, we have w^hat is called a slow moving picture It should be 
noticed that the order of the semantic rhythmic processes is fourfold , 
It involves order not only in ‘space’ (three dimensions) but m ‘time’ 
also Periods of contraction alternate with periods of rest, and this 
occurs at nearly regular intervals 

This rhythmic tendency is, indeed, so fundamental and so inherent 
in living tissue that we can, at pleasure, make voluntary muscles, for 
example, exhibit artificially induced rhythmic contractions by immers- 
ing them in special saline solutions, as, for instance, a solution of sodium 
chloride We should also not wonder why modern science assumes that 
life may have originated in the sea The phj sico-chemical conditions of 
saline solutions are such that they favour rh} thmic processes , they not 
only may originate them, but may also keep them up, and life seemingly 
IS very closely connected w'lth autonomous rhj thmic processes 

Such rhythmic processes are felt on lower orders of abstraction as 
‘continuous time’, probably because of the rapidity and overlapping of 
periods On higher order abstractions, when structurally proper lin- 
guistic and extra-neural means are developed, they appear as timej 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


231 


Perhaps, neurologically, animals feel similarly as we do about 
‘time’, but they have no neurological means to elaborate linguistic and 
extra-neural means which alone allow us to extend and summarize the 
manifold experience of many generations (time-binding) They can- 
not pass from ‘time’ to ‘timej’. Obviously, if we do not, we then re- 
nounce our human characteristics, and copy animals in our evaluating 
processes, a practice which must be harmful 

In nature the visible and invisible materials seemingly consist of 
recurring pulsations of extremely minute and rapid periods, which, in 
some instances, become macroscopic periods In the first case, we cannot 
see them or feel them, so we talk about ‘concreteness’. In the second 
case, we see the periodic movements, as of the earth around the sun , or 
we feel our heart-beats , We see that the visible or invisible materials in 
nature are compounded of periodic pulsations and are simply two aspects 
of one process The splitting of these processes into ‘matter’, ‘space’, 
and ‘time’ is a characteristic function of our nervous system These 
abstractions are inside our skins, and are methods of representation for 
ourselves to ourselves, and are not the objective world around us 

It must be realized that under such circumstances we cannot speak 
about ‘fimteness’ or ‘mfiniteness’ of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’, as all 
the old ‘philosophers’ have done, Leibnitz included, because these terms 
‘finite’ and ‘infinite’, though they may be conceivably applied to numbers 
of aspects of objective entities, have no lueainng if applied to linguistic 
issues, that is, to forms of representation outside of numbers Of course, 
if, through a semantic pathological disturbance (objectification), we do 
ascribe some delusional objective existence to verbal terms, we can then 
talk about anything, but such conversations have no more value than the 
deliria of the ‘mentally’ ill The terras ‘finite’ or ‘infinite’ are only legiti- 
mately applied to numerical problems, and so we can speak legitimately 
of a finite or infinite numbers of inches, or pounds, or hours, or similar 
entities, but statements about the ‘finite mind’ or the ‘understanding of 
the infinite’. , have no meanings and only reveal the pathological semantic 
disturbance of the patient. 

The objectification of our feeling of ‘time’ has had, and has at pres- 
ent, very tragic consequences strictly connected with our un-sanity It 
must be remembered that particularly m ‘mental’ and nervous difficulties 
the patient seldom realizes the character of his illness He may feel 
pains, he may feel very unhappy, and what not, but he usually does not 
understand their origin This is particularly true with semantic disturb- 
ances One may explain endlessly, but, in most cases, it is perfectly 
hopeless to try to help. Only a very few benefit. Here lies, also, the 



232 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


mam difficulty in writing this book Readers who identify, that is, who 
believe unconsciously with all their affectne impulses in the objectivity 
of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’, will ha\e difficulty in modifying their sr 
m this field. 

Let us see now what consequences the objectification of ‘time’ will 
have for us If we do not objectify, and feel instinctively and perma- 
nently that words are not the things spoken about, then we could not 
speak about such meaningless subjects as the ‘beginning’ or the ‘end’ 
of ‘time’ But, if we are semantically disturbed and objectify, then, of 
course, since objects have a begmnmg and an end, so also would ‘time’ 
have a ‘beginning’ and an ‘end’ In such pathological fancies the universe 
must have a ‘beginning m time’ and so must have been made , and all 
of our old anthropomorphic and objectified mythologies follow, including 
the older theories of entropy in physics But, if ‘time’ is only a human 
form of representation and not an object, the universe has no ‘beginning 
in time’ and no ‘end m time’ , in other words, the universe is ‘time’-less 
It was not made, it just ‘was, is, and will be’ The moment we realize, feel 
permanently, and utilize these realizations and feelings that words are 
not things, then only do we acquire the semantic freedom to use different 
forms of representation We can fit better their structure to the facts 
at hand, become better adjusted to these facts which are not words, and 
so evaluate properly m o realities, which evaluation is important for 
sanity 

According to what we know in 1933, the universe is ‘time’-less, 
m other words, there is no such object as ‘time’ In terms of periods, 
or years, or minutes, or seconds, which is a different language, we may 
have infinite numbers of such timej This statement is another form of 
stating the principle of conservation of energy, or whatever other fun- 
damental higher abstraction physicists will discover 

Because ‘time’ is a feeling, produced by conditions of this world 
outside and inside our skins, which can be said to represent timej, the 
problem of ‘time’ becomes a neuro-mathematical issue It must also be 
noticed that timej, as a term, implies timej of something, somewhere, 
and so, as with plenum or fulness, it is structurally a non-el, A term 

Timej has also many other most important implications It implies 
numbers of timej, it implies periods, waves, vibrations, frequencies, 
units, quanta, discontinuities, and, indeed, the whole structural appa- 
ratus of modern science 

Euclidean ‘space’ had the semantic background of ‘emptiness’ In 
It we moved our figures from place to place and always assumed that 
this could be done quite safely and accurately Newtonian mechanics 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


233 


also followed this path and even postulated an ‘absolute space’ (empti- 
ness) All of which harks back to the old aristotelianism. 

E, N, and A systems have the semantic background of fulness or 
plenum, although, unfortunately, this background is, as yet, mainly 
unrealized, not fully utilized , it has not, as yet, generally affected our j i. 

A simple illustration will make the difference clear Imagine that 
in one part of a large room we have an open umbrella which we would 
like to compare with another ‘unit’ open umbrella Let us imagine that 
the room has the air pumped out and also that all other eventual dis- 
turbing factors are eliminated We can move our open ‘unit’ umbrella 
from one part of the room to another, and this movement will not con- 
siderably distort our ‘unit’ umbrella Now let us perform a similar 
experiment in two houses, separated some distance, during a storm, a 
storm implying, of course, fulness Can we transport our ‘unit’ umbrella 
through the storm and preserve its shape , in a fulness, without taking 
the fulness into account^ Of course not We see what serious differ- 
ence it makes if our theories presuppose ‘emptiness’ or ‘fulness’ 

This shows also why the non-euclidean geometries which deal with 
a plenum are structurally preferable and semantically sounder and more 
in accord with the structure of the world, than the language of euclidean 
‘emptiness’, to which there is nothing in nature to correspond Should 
we wonder that modern linguists (mathematicians) work in the direction 
of fulness and of fusing geometry with physics It is obviously the only 
thing to do Differential geometry is the foundation of this new outlook, 
but, even m this geometry, lines could legitimately be transported over 
great distances Weyl introduced a semantic improvement of this point 
of view by assuming that for a differential geometiy it is illegitimate 
to use comparisons at large distances,. but that all operations should be 
betw^een indefinitely near points ^ 

It should be noticed that scientists, in general, disregard almost 
completely the verbal and semantic problems explained here, a fact w'hicli 
leads to great and unnecessary confusion, and makes modern w’orks inac- 
cessible to the layman Take, for instance, the case of the ‘cur\ature of 
space-time’ Mathematicians use this expression very often and, inside 
their skins, they know mostly w'hat they are talking about Millions 
upon millions of even intelligent readers hear such an expression as the 
‘curvature of space-time’ Owung to nurseiy mythology and primitive 
sr, ‘space’ for them is ‘emptiness’, and so they try to understand the 
‘curvature of emptiness’ After severe pains, they come to a very true, 
yet, for them, hopeless, conclusion , namely, that ‘curvature of emptiness’ 
IS either non-sense or ‘beyond them’, with the semantic result that either 



234 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


they ha\e contempt for the mathematicians who deal with non-sense or 
feel hopeless about their own capacities — both undesirable semantic 
results 

The truth is that ‘curvature of emptiness’ has no meanings, no mat- 
ter zvlio might say it, but curvature of fulness is entirely different Let 
the reader look at the cloud of smoke from his cigarette or cigar, and 
he will at once understand what ‘curvature of fulness’ means Of course, 
he will realize, as well as the mathematicians do, that the problem may 
be difficult, but, at least, it has sense and represents a problem It is not 
non-sense 

Similar remarks apply to higher dimensions in ‘space’ Higher 
dimensions m ‘emptiness’ is also non-sense, and the layman is right m 
refusing to accept it But higher dimensions in fulness is entirely a 
different problem A look at the cloud of smoke from our cigarette will 
again make it completely plain to everybody that to give an account of 
fulness, we may need an enormous number of data or, as we say 
roughly, of dimensions This applies, also, to the new four-dimensional 
world of Minkowski It is a fulness made up of world lines, a network 
of events or intervals , and it is not non-sense 

Lately, there has appeared an excellent book by Bertrand Russell, 
published by the International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and 
Scientific Method, and yet the title is The Analysis of Matter, without 
any quotation marks 

This book IS really an unusually fine and fundamental work which 
has no defects w hich could be implied by the title This title simply dis- 
regards the issues explained here, it should be The Analysis of ‘Matter' 

It IS with some pleasure that one sees such an authority as Edding- 
ton, m his The Mathematical Theory of Relativity, on p 158, making 
the statement ‘In using the word “space” it is difficult to repress irrele- 
vant ideas , therefore let us abandon the W'ord and state explicitly that 
w'e are considering a iietzvork of inteivals’ 

For the reasons already given, I do not use the terms ‘matter’, 
‘space’, or ‘time’ without quotation marks , and, w'herever possible, shall 
use, instead, the terms ‘materials’, ‘plenum’, ‘fulness’, ‘spread’, and 
‘timej’, (say seconds) Indeed, these semantic problems are so serious 
that they should be brought to the attention of International Mathemati- 
cal and Physical Congresses, so that a new and structurally correct 
terminology could be established It is not desirable that science should 
structurally mislead the layman and disturb his sr It is easier for 
trained specialists to change their terminology than to re-educate seman- 
tically the rest of the race I would suggest that terms ‘matter’, ‘sub- 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


235 


stance’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ should be completely eliminated from science, 
because of their extremely wide-spread and vicious structural and so 
semantic implications, and that the terms ‘events’, ‘space-time’, ‘material’, 
‘plenum’, ‘fulness’, ‘spreads’, ‘timer’ , be used instead These terms not 
only do not have the old structural and semantic implications, but, on 
the contrary, they convey the modern structural notions and involve new 
s r. The use of the old terms drags in, unconsciously and automatically, 
the old primitive metaphysical structure and s r which are entirely con- 
tradicted by experience and modern science I venture to suggest that 
such a change in terminology would do more to render the newer works 
intelligible than scores of volumes of explanations using the old ter- 
minology 

Before summarizing in Parts TX and X what modern science 
has to tell about the structure of the world around us, it will be profitable 
to enquire what are the means by which we can recognize this structure. 

Section B The neurological function of abstracting 

Protoplasm, even in its simplest form, is sensitive to different 
mechanical and chemical stimulations , and, indeed, undifferentiated pro- 
toplasm has already all the potentialities of the future nervous system 
If we take an undifferentiated bit of protoplasm, and some stimulation 
IS applied to some point, the stimulus does not spread somehow ‘all over 
at once’, with some mysterious ‘infinite’ velocity, but propagates itself 
with finite velocity and a diminishing gradient from one end of our bit 
of protoplasm to the opposite end 

Because of the finite velocity of propagation and the fact that the 
action IS by contact in a plenum, the impulse has a definite direction and 
diminishing intensity, or, as we say, the bit of protoplasm acquires a 
temporal polarity (head-end) Such polarity conditions produce a di- 
rected wave of excitement of diminishing intensity, which Child calls a 
dynamic gradient If such a stimulation were applied to one spot for a 
considerable lengfth of ‘time’, some kind of polarization may become last- 
ing In some such way those dynamic gradients have become slriictural- 
ized m the forms of our nervous system, which represent the preferred 
paths by which the nervous impulses travel 

The bodies of most organisms are protected from outside stimula- 
tion by some kind of membrane or cuticle and the parts of the surface 
have developed so as to be sensitive to one form of stimulation and not 
to others For instance, the eye registers the stimulations of light waves, 
while it IS insensitive to sound , and, even if hit, it gives only the feeling 
of light Each ‘sense-organ’ has also the nervous means of concentrating 



236 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


stimuli, intensifying them , and so of effecting the most efficient response 
of the corresponding end-organ 

In our school days we were taught that i\ e have five ‘senses’ Mod- 
em researches show that there are more than twenty different ‘senses’ 
Besides, as far as ‘Smith’ is concerned, w e know that ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ 
cannot be divided 

The mam stimulations which we find in the outside world may be 
divided into three groups The first are connected with the roughest 
macroscopic manifestations of the outside world, they are mechanical 
impacts which we abstract as ‘tactile sensations’, which range from a 
single mechanical contact to rhj thmicallj' repeated contacts with our skin 
as frequently as 1552 Mbrations per second Above this limit ‘timer’ 
begin to be registered as a “duration’ , that is, the individuality of ‘timej’ 
IS lost, and we feel pressure At this level we deal with gross macro- 
scopic manifestations, which are not only felt but can also be seen 

The second group of manifestations is. in the main, no more on the 
gross level Here belong the vibratory manifestations which are no more 
Msible to the unaided eye V'^e may speak of them as on the microscopic 
level. They are mechanical vibrations of the air , and we become 
acquainted with them in the form of sound The vibrations w’hich the 
average ear is able to register range from about 30 (sometimes even 12) 
to about 30,000 or even 50,000 vibrations a second The ear does not 
register any other vibrations ' 

The third group of Mbratory manifestations belongs to a still subtler 
le\el They are electromagnetic weaves of an enormous variety of wa\e- 
lengths and number of vibrations per second The lower members of 
this series are the Hertzian electric waves, the higher members are the 
X-, or Rontgen-rays Our nervous systems are capable of registering 
only a very limited range of these vibrations , namely, the waves called 
radiant heat, the light waves, and the ultra-violet rays, these last only on 
a chemical level It seems that we have no organ which responds directly 
to electric waves, ultra-violet rays. X-rays, and the many other rays 
which we know from laboratory w'ork 

Similarly, the chemical ‘senses’ of taste and smell register only a 
very small number of actual excitations to which they are exposed 

Animals have different limits of ner\ous susceptibility, but we can 
have no idea how the world looks to them unless their nervous system 
is quite similar to our own The above statements wull become clearer 
if we tabulate some of them The following table is taken from An 
Introduction to Neurology by Professor C Judson Herrick, p 85 (Fifth 
Edition)

As a further illustration of the merhanism of abstracting, we may 
suggest the observation of Weber that if, for instance, a room is lighted 
with 100 candles, and if one more candle is brought in, the increased 
illumination will be appreciated very slightly But not so if we had a 
room illuminated with 1000 candles In this case, we should not appre- 
ciate the addition of one candle at all Ten candles should be introduced 
to make an appreciable difference in our perceptions The Weber law, 
as it IS called, stated that m the above case 1/100 of the original strength 
of the stimulus is needed to make a change appreciable For light, the 
fraction is about 1/100, for noise, about 1/3, for pressure, it varies 
between 1/30 and 1/10, for weight, between 1/70 and 1/40 in various 
parts of the body. 

If we use compasses and experiment with pricks, we find that in 
different parts of the body the limit of the distance apart of the points 
when we feel one prick and yet have two, is different 

On the tip of the tongue this limit is . 1 mm 

On the palmar surface of third phalanx of forefinger . . .2 mm 

On the palmar surface of second phalanges of fingers . 4 mm 

On the palm of the hand . ... 10 mm 

On the dorsal surface of first phalanges of fingers .... 14 mm 

On the back of hand . .25 mm 

On the upper and lower parts of forearm . . .37 mm 

On the middle thigh and back . 62 mm “ 

A ‘sensation’ requires appreciable ‘time’ (timej by a clock) for its 
development Part of the ‘time’ is spent at the end-organ, part m con- 
veying the nervous impulse along the nerves to the brain and part m the 
brain A ‘sensation’ usually outlasts the stimulus, and often a single 
stimulus produces a whole series of ‘after-sensations’. 

As compared with the ‘sensations’ obtained from pain spots, touch 
IS quicker in its development and persistence. With a vibrating string, 
1500 vibrations a second are recognizable by touch as vibrations At 
over 1552 vibrations a second, the vibratory character is lost, and we 
feel only continuous pressure A toothed re vo lving wheel gives the 
feeling of smoothness (and ‘continuity’) when the teeth meet the skin 
at the rate of from 480 to 680 per second ® 

The above given tables and facts are deeply significant. We see, 
first of all, that structurally we are immersed m a world full of energy 
manifestations, out of which we abstract directly only a very small por- 
tion, these abstractions being already coloured by the specific functioning 
and structure of the nervous system — ^the abstractors Very probably, 
there are many more energy manifestations which, as yet, we have not 



‘MATTER’, ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


239 


discovered Every few years we discover some new form of energy 
manifestation, and, at present, our knowledge is already so advanced 
that it IS highly probable that the list is much longer Finally, and here 
the whole ‘structure of human knowledge’ begins to play its role, for 
sanity we have to know and evaluate this world around us, if we want 
to adjust ourselves satisfactorily to it 

Section C Problems of adjustment 

Is the problem of adjustment m the animal world similar to that in 
the human world ^ No, it is entirely different Animals do not alter 
their environment so rapidly, nor to such an extent as humans do Ani- 
mals are not time-binders, they have not the capacity by which each 
generation can start where the former left off Neurologically, animals 
have no means for extra-neural extensions, which extensions involve 
the complex mechanism with which we are dealing throughout this work 

The example of the caterpillar, already cited, shows clearly how 
organisms not adapted to their environment perish and do not propagate 
their special, non-survival characteristics Similar remarks apply to 
hens, their eggs, and chicks which are kept in buildings without sunlight 
or with ordinary glass windows , these, also, do not survive, and so pass 
out of the picture 

With humans, the situation is entirely different We are able to 
produce conditions which do not exist in unaided nature We produce 
artificial conditions and so our numbers and distribution are not regu- 
lated by unaided nature alone Animals cannot over-populate the globe, 
as they do not produce artificially We do over-populate this globe be- 
cause we produce artificially With animals, selfishness comes before 
altruism, and the non-selfish perish An animal has to live first, then act 
With man, the reverse is ti ue The selfish may produce such conditions 
that they are destroyed by them We can over-populate the globe because 
of artificial production, and so we are actually born nowadays into a 
world where we must act first before we can live As I have already 
shown m my Manhood of Humanity (p 72), the old animalistic, falla- 
cious generalizations have been, and are, the foundation of our ‘philoso- 
phies’, ‘ethics’, systems , and naturally such animalistic doctrines must 
be disastrous to us Neurologically, we build up conditions which our 
nervous systems cannot stand , and so we break down, and, perhaps, 
shall not even survive 

Animals have no ‘doctrines’ in our meaning of the term , thus, doc- 
trines are no part of their environment, and, accordingly, animals can- 
not perish through false doctrines We do have them, however, and. 



240 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


since they are the most vital environmental semantic conditions regu- 
lating our li\es, if they are fallacious, they make our lives unadjusted 
and so, ultimately, lead to non-survival. 

So we see that ‘human adjustment’ is quite a different and much 
more complex affair than ‘animal adjustment’ The ‘world’ of ‘man’ is 
also a different and much more complex ‘world’ than that of the animal 
There seems to be no escape from this conclusion We see, also, that 
what we used to call ‘senses’ supply us with information about the 
world that is lery limited in quantity, specific in quality, an abstraction 
of low order, never being ‘it’ Being often unaffected, our ‘senses’ are 
not able to abstract, obviously, some of the most fundamental manifesta- 
tions of energ} to be found in the external world If we speak of the 
older so-called ‘sense perceptions’ as lower order abstractions, then we 
find that we learn about the other subtler manifestations of energy 
through science, higher neural and extra-neural means, which we may 
call higher order abstractions In the older days, w'e called this kind of 
knowledge ‘inferential knowledge’ The animals do not have these 
higher order abstractions in that sense, and so their world is for them 
devoid of these extra-sensible manifestations of energy. 

It must be remembered that these higher order abstractions and the 
‘inferential knowledge’ of the old theories (they are not equivalent by 
definition) have a very similar status Organisms w'ork as-a-whole, and 
to separate completely higher and low^er order abstractions is impossible 
All that IS said here justifies the new terminology Our nervous system 
does abstract, does summarize, does integrate on different levels and in 
different orders, and the result of a stimulus is not the stimulus itself. 
The stone is not the pain produced by the stone dropping on our foot ; 
neither is the flame we see, nor the burn we feel The actual process 
goes on outside of our skin, as represented by the ‘realities’ of modern 
science 

We have already spoken frequently of the different order abstrac- 
tions, their special characteristics, dynamic versus static , and the means 
of translation of lower orders into higher, and vice versa Events which 
are going on and for which we have no direct ‘senses’ of abstraction, as, 
for instance, electric waves, Rontgen-rays, w'lreless waves , w'e know 
only through extra-neural extensions of our nervous sjstem given by 
science and scientific instruments Naturally, we should expect that the 
structure of our abstracting mechanism would be also reflected in these 
higher order abstractions Facts show this to be true ; and practically 
all modern science proves it directly or indirectly This is why, for 
instance, we have the mathematical methods for passing from dynamic 



■MATTER', ‘SPACE’, ‘TIME’ 


241 


to static, and vice versa , why we have quantum theories and conditions , 
and why we have problems of continuity versus discontinuity, atomic 
theories , 

The above is not a plea for certain old-fashioned ‘idealistic phil- 
osophies’ and still less for ‘solipsism’ Far from it The object of this 
present work is to face hard structural experimental m o facts, analyse 
these facts in a language of a similar structure {A), and so to reach 
tentatively new conclusions which again can be verified by experiments 
Once more the reader must be warned against carelessly translating the 
structurally new terms into the old terms The complete structural, 
psycho-logical, semantic, and neurological analysis of one single such 
new term would afford material for several volumes and so is impossible 
in this work The usefulness of the old terms has been exhausted The 
structural consequences of the old terms have been practically all worked 
out, and, as a rule, we cannot have much quarrel with the older con- 
clusions m the old language If we reach different conclusions, or get 
some new emphasis, it will be due to the use of the structurally neiv 
language If we translate the laew into the old, the old conclusions are 
usually truer than the new ones The reverse is also tr ue , the old con- 
clusions become false or, at best, only gain emphasis because of the 
structure of the new language The problem of all theories, old or new, 
IS to give a structural account of the facts known, to account for excep- 
tions, and to predict new experimental structural facts which again may 
be verified empirically 

Section D Semantic considerations 

We speak much and vaguely about the ‘structure’ of language, but 
extremely little work has been done in this field In the_ present work, 
we not only tackle this problem as best we can, theoretically, but we 
also use a language of a new non-el, functional structure, and the results, 
whatever their value, are actually the results of such procedure 

A short while ago we did not even know that such problems existed 
Dreams, alone, about such problems did not help, for, before the struc- 
tures of two different entities can be compared, these entities must first 
be produced Then, and only then, can we compare and evaluate them 
Before we could compare the A, the E, and the N systems with A, E, 
and Ef systems the last had to be produced, no matter how imperfect they 
might be at the beginning 

Something similar can be said about languages Before we can 
speak of them in the plural and compare them, we must have more than 
one for comparison Mathematics has pointed out this problem for us in 

16 



242 IV. STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


geometry For instance, we have to deal with different frames or refer- 
ences, or different systems of co-ordinates We find that they represent 
different languages and that they may introduce purely verbal statements 
which have nothing to do with the subject of our analysis (extrinsic 
characteristics) We have also found that some characteristics may 
appear in one form of representation and not appear so readily in an- 
other For instance, we know that every line, except the X axis through 
a point 0 which is the intersection of a parabola with its X axis, cuts 
the curve a second time This fact, important for us to know, appears 
clearly in the polar co-ordinate form of representation, but does not 
appear in the rectangular form of equations, although, when once a 
characteristic of a curve is discovered, it can be usually translated into 
the other co-ordinate languages In such cases as this, a language of 
new structure has a kind of creative character, in that it makes some 
structural discoveries easier. 

But the co-ordinate methods were not quite satisfactory They 
introduced, too easily, too many extraneous, extrinsic characteristics, 
belonging to the language and not to the subject Mathematicians de- 
cided to get away from these metaphysical ‘outside’ references by refer- 
ring the entity to itself to become more experimental They invented the 
internal theory of surfaces, a vector language where they refer the 
entity to itself, its curvature, its length and direction. Finally, m the 
extension of the vector language which is called the tensor calculus, 
they achieved a still larger kind of independence Having invented three 
languages in which we can speak about one issue, we are now able to 
meet the problem of comparison of these languages At once, most im- 
portant structural and methodological problems arise 

The newer quantum mechanics are also an epoch-making linguistic 
structural innovation, not only in physics, but also in methodology We 
have, at present, three, or, perhaps, more, quantum mechanics which 
speak about one subject, but in entirely different languages I say ‘three 
or more’, because, from a methodological point of view, it is very hard, 
at present, to be precise, as the problems are too new and, as yet, too 
little analysed Similar remarks apply to systems Before two systems 
can be compared, a second S 3 Stem must be produced Then we can 
compare them 

In our brief verbal analysis of ‘space’, and ‘time’, and ‘matter’, we 
have seen that these represent terms, or linguistic means, not objects 
We have seen, also, that these antique forms of representation have 
very unsatisfactory structural implications They introduce a verbal 
elementalism structurally absent m nature, and by a process of objecti-

fication lead to many kinds of fanciful semantically harmful meta- 
physics. Since Einstein and Minkowski, the excellent term 'event’ has 
been introduced into scientific literature It is a term of such epoch- 
making semantic importance that it should become a term of daily use 
and should be introduced into elementary schools Teachers do not per- 
form their duties honestly or intelligently if they disregard such struc- 
tural, linguistic, and semantic issues, which, as we have seen, are the 
central problem of all possible education. 

Likewise, we have already seen that the chunk of nature which i\e 
call a ‘pencil’ is not ‘matter’ nor ’space’ nor ‘time’, the terms being only 
terms Is such el language structurally appropriate for the purpose of 
speaking about the world around us? It seems undeniable that such 
language is quite out-dated and very unsatisfactory It introduces struc- 
turally an artificial elementalism of a verbal character, in spite of the 
fact that even the most elementary consideration shows that structurally 
the opposite is true, namely, that ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ can never 
be experimentally divided The term ‘event’ is precisely the term which 
does away with this old and vicious elementalism 

All that we deal with m the outside world involves indivisibly ‘mat- 
ter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ Using the old language, there cannot be some- 
thing somewhere at ‘no time’, or something at some ‘time’ and ‘no 
where’ or ‘nothing’ ‘somewhere’ at ‘some time’ Everything which hap- 
pens must be structurally represented as something, somewhere, at some 
‘time’. If the structure of the world happened to be such that ‘nothing’ 
would happen ‘nowhere’ at ‘no time’, then we should have nothing to 
talk about, and all we would or could say would deal with our fancies 
The four-dimensional language, which describes happenings structurally 
more nearly as we experience them, is precisely the language of ‘events’ 
It should be remembered that in daily life we live by four-dimensional 
event-conditions That is, the events which interest us are something, 
somewhere, and some ‘time’ If we want two of our friends to become 
acquainted with each other, we invite them to our home The appoint- 
ment IS in three dimensions m ‘space’ (to the left or to the right, for- 
ward or backward, up or down), and at a given hour So we see that 
our daily life is lived m a four-dimensional space-time manifold, and 
we begin to appreciate the fact that science has lately caught up with 
such fundamental structural ‘realities’. It must be noticed that the new 
four-dimensional space-time language does not, or should not, use the 
term ‘matter’ as we used it m the old way In the new language, the bits 
of materials we deal with are connected analytically with the ‘curvature’ 
of this space-time manifold. 



244 IV STRUCTURAL FACTORS IN A LANGUAGES 


The reader should realize that the structurally new language is simi- 
lar to the structure of our experience, and involves profound methodo- 
logical and, therefore, psycho-logical, semantic factors It has entirely 
different semantic values, and, perhaps, because of this fact, it is an 
irreversible ad\ance, no matter how details may be altered 

The newtonians, for the most part, overlook the fact that all 
theories, their own included, are a semantic product of the functioning 
of the nervous system, and so involve some ‘logic’ and ‘psychology’. In 
the new theories, a kind of physical subjectivity always appears which 
ought to be taken care of Ve know, for instance, that if we immerse a 
part of a straight stick in u ater, the stick appears to be broken, although 
actually it has not been broken A photographic camera gives a similar 
record So we see that, besides the psycho-logical subjectivity, there is 
a most important physical subjectivity, which is introduced by the use 
of instruments The mam difficulties in modern science are precisely in 
the elimination of this physical subjectivity, particularly when we deal 
n itli such minute entities that the light waves miss them In the case of 
an hypothetical gamma-raj microscope, for instance, the rays would 
produce what is called a Compton effect,* and so the results of the 
experiment would be altered by the instrument and procedure 

We ought not to be surprised that the old systems of ‘motion’ and 
‘emotion’ in science (Newton) and ‘philosophy’ (Bergson) should 
result from speculations on the old A el language and the introduction of 
fanciful and fallacious assumptions of an ‘infinity’ somewhere, and other 
fancies The realization of this marks a new semantic epoch in our 
lives It IS to the credit of these two men that they have summarized 
these old tendencies m such a masterly way that we are enabled to go 
beyond them We shall return to this subject when we analyse the four- 
dimensional ‘world’ of Minkowski, and, then, we shall summarize briefly 
what w'e now know about ‘space’, ‘time’, and ‘matter’ (see Parts IX 
and X).

PART V 


ON THE NON-ARISTOTELIAN LANGUAGE 
CALLED MATHEMATICS 


Once a statement is cast into mathematical form it may be manipulated 
in accordance with these rules and every configuration of the symbols will 
represent facts in harmony with and dependent on those contained in the 
original statement Now this comes very close to what we conccl^e the 
action of the brain structures to be in performing intellectual acts with the 
symbols of ordinary language In a sense, therefore, the mathematician 
has been able to perfect a device through which a part of the labor of logical 
thought is carried on outside the centra] nervous system with only that 
supervision which is requisite to manipulate the symbols in accordance 
with the rules csssi Horatio d williams 


The toughminded suggest that the theory of the infinite elaborated by 
the great mathematicians of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, 
without which mathematical analysis as it is actually used today is im- 
possible, has been committing suicide in an unnecessarily prolonged and 
complicated manner for the past half century (22) e t bell 

The solution goes on famously, but just as wc have got rid of the other 
unknowns, behold ' V disappears as well, and we are left with the indis- 
putable but irritating conclusion — 

0 = 0 

This IS a favourite device that mathematical equations resort to, when 
we propound stupid questions ci49) A s Eddington 


Who shall criticize the builders^ Certainly not those who have stood 
idly by without lifting a stone (23) E T bell 


let me remind any non-mathematicians that when a mathema- 
tician lays down the elaborate tools by which he achieves precision m his 
own domain, he is unprepiared and awkward m handling the ordinary tools 
of language. This is why mathematicians always disappoint the expecta- 
tion that they will be precise and reasonable and clear-cut in their state- 
ments about everyday affairs, and why they are, in fact, more fallible than 
ordinary mortals (529) Oswald veblen

CHAPTER XVIII 


MATHEMATICS AS A LAXGUAC.E OF A STRUCTURE SIMILAR 
TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD 

To-day there are not a few physicists who, like Kirchhoff and Mach, 
regard the task of physical theory as being merelj a mathematical descrip- 
tion {as economical as possible) of the empirical connections between ob- 
servable quantities, tea description which reproduces the connection, 
as far as possible, without the intervention of unobservable elements 

(466) E SCHKODI^GEK 

But in the prevalent discussion of classes, there are illegitimate transi- 
tions to the notions of a ‘nexus' and of a ‘proposition ' The appeal to a 
class to perform the serv-ices of a proper entity is exactly analogous to an 
appeal to an imaginary terrier to kill a real rat isrsi A M whiiehevd 

Roughly it amounts to this mathematical analysis as it works today 
must make use of irrational numbers (such as the square root of two), the 
sense if any in which such numbers exist is hazy Their reputed mathe- 
matical existence implies the disputed theories of the infinite The para- 
doxes remain. Without a satisfactory theory of irrational numbers, among 
other things, Achilles does not catch up with the tortoise, and the earth 
cannot turn on its axis But, as Galileo remarked, it does It would seem 
to follow that something is wrong with our attempts to compass the in- 
finite (22) E T BELL 

Themapts not the thing mapped When the map is identified with the thing 
mapped we have one of the vast melting pots of numerology (604) e t dell 

The theory of numbers is the last great uncivilized continent of mathe- 
matics. It IS split up into innumerable countries, fertile enough in them- 
selves, but all more or less indifferent to one another's weltare and without 
a v'estige of a central, intelligent government If an> >oung Alexander is 
weeping for a new world to conquer, it lies before him, (23) e t. hell 

The present work — nameh, the building of a non-arisioteUan sys- 
tem, and an introduction to a theort' of sanity and general .‘•emantics — 
depends, fundamentally, for its success on the recognition of mathematics 
as a language similar in structure to the world in which w'e live 

The maze of often unconnected knowledge we have gathered m 
the fields w'ith which this part is dealing is so tremendous tliat it would 
require several volumes to cover the field even partially Under such 
conditions, it is impossible to deal with the subject m anv' other waj 
than by very careful selection, and so I shall, therefore, say only as 
much as is necessarv' for my present semantic purpose 

It is a common experience of our race that w ith a happy generaliza- 
tion man}’ unconnected parts of our know ledge become connected . man} 
‘m}steries’ of science become simply a linguistic issue, and then the 
mysteries v’anish New generalizations introduce new attitudes (evalua- 
tion) which, as usual, serious!} simplify the problems for a new generation. 
In the present vvoik. we are treating problems from the point of v'levv of 
such a generalization, of wide application, namely, structure, which is 
forced upon us by the denial of the ‘is’ of identity , so that structure be- 
comes the only link between the objectiv e and verbal levels The next con- 
sequence is that structure alone is the only possible content of knowledge 

247 



248 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


Investigating structure, we have found that structure can be defined 
in terms of relations, and the latter, for special purposes, in terms of 
multi-dimensional order Obviously, to investigate structure, we must 
look for relations, and so for multi-dimensional order. The full applica- 
tion of the above principles becomes our guide for future enquiry. 

In the recent past, we have become accustomed to such arguments 
as, for instance, that the theory of Einstein has to be accepted on 
‘epistemological’ grounds Naturally, the scientist or the layman who 
has heard the last term, but never bothered to ascertain that it means 
‘according to the structure of human knowledge’, would recognize no neces- 
sity to accept something which violates all his habitual s r, for reasons 
about which he does not know or care But if we say that the Einstein 
theory has to be accepted, for the ‘time’ being, at least, as an irreversible 
structural Imgiiistic progress, this statement carries for many quite a 
different verbal and semantic implication, and one worth considering 
Mathematics has, of late, become so extremely elaborate and com- 
plex that it takes practically a lifetime to specialize in even one of its 
many fields Here and there notions of extreme creative generality 
appear, i\ Inch help us to see relations and dependence between formerly 
non-connected fields For instance, the arithmetization of mathematics, 
01 the theory of groups, or the theory of aggregates, has each become 
such a supreme generalization At present, there is a general tendency 
among all of us, scientists included, to confuse orders of abstractions 
This results in a psycho-logical semantic blockage and in the impossi- 
bility of seeing broader issues clearly 

Some of the structural issues are still but little understood, and, in 
writing this chapter, I lay myself open to a reproach from the layman 
that I have given too much attention to mathematics, and from the pro- 
fessional mathematician that I have given too little My reply is that 
what IS said here is necessary for rounding up the semantic foundations 
of the system, and that I explain only enough to carry the mam points 
of structure and as semantic suggestions for further semantic researches 
I have found that among some physicists and some mathematicians 
the thesis that mathematics is the only language which, in 1933, is simi- 
lar in structure to the world, is not always acceptable As to the second 
thesis, the similarity of its structure to our nervous system, some even 
seem to feel that this statement borders on the sacrilegious > These 
objectors, apparently, believe that I ascribe more to mathematics than 
is just Some physicists point out to me the non-satisfactory develop- 
ment of mathematics, and they seem to confuse the inadequacy of a 
given mathematical theory with the general m o structure of mathematics 
Thus, if some physical experimental investigation is conducted — for 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


instance, on high pressure — and the older theories predict a beH^our 
exemplified by the curve (A), while 
the experimental new data show that 
the actual curve is (B), such a result 
would show unmistakably that the first 
theory is not structurally correct But, 
in itself, this result does not affect the 
correctness of a statement about the general structure of mathematics 
which can account for both curves 

Until very lately, we had a very genuine problem in physics with 
the quantum phenomena which seem to proceed by discrete steps, while 
our mathematics is fundamentally based on assumptions of continuity. 
Here we had seemingly a serious structural discrepancy, which, however, 
has been satisfactorily overcome by the wave theory of the newer 
quantum mechanics, explained in Part X, where the discontinuities aie 
accounted for, m spite of the use of differential equations and, therefore, 
of continuous mathematics 

But, if we start with fundamental assumptions of continuity, ne 
always can account for discontinuities by introducing wave theories or 
some similar devices Therefore, it is impossible, in our case, to argue 
from the wave theory (for instance) to the structure of mathematics, or 
vice versa, without a fundamental and independent general structural 
analysis, which alone can elucidate the problem at hand 

Mathematicians may object on the ground that the new revision of 
the foundation of mathematics, originated by Brouwer and Wejl, chal- 
lenges the ‘existence’ of irrational numbers . and, therefore, destroj’s the 
very foundations of continuity and the legitimacy of existing mathe- 
matics 

In answer to such a criticism, we should notice, first, that the cur- 
rent ‘continuity’ is of two kinds One is of a higher grade, and is usually 
called by this name , the other continuity is of a lower grade and is 
usually called ‘compactness’ The new revision challenges the higher 
continuity, but does not affect compactness, which, as a result, will, per- 
haps, have to suffice in the future for all mathematics, since compactness 
is sufficient to meet all psycho-logpcal requirements, once the problems 
of ‘infinity’ are properly understood 

A structural independent analysis of mathematics, treated as a 
language and a form of human behaviour, establishes the similarity of 
this language to the undeniable structural characteristics of this world 
and of the human nervous system These few and simple structural 
foundations are arrived at by inspection of known data and may be 
considered as well established

The existing definitions of mathematics are not entirely satisfactory. 
They are either too broad, or too narrow, or do not emphasize enough 
the main characteristics of mathematics A semantic definition of mathe- 
matics should be broad enough to cover all existing branches of mathe- 
matics , should be narrow enough to exclude linguistic disciplines which 
are not considered mathematical by the best judgement of specialists, and 
should also be flexible enough to remain valid, no matter what the future 
developments of mathematics may be 

I have said that mathematics is the only language, at present, which 
in structure, is similar to the structure of the world and the nervous sys- 
tem For purposes of exposition, we shall have to divide our analysis 
accordingly, remembering, in the meantime, that this division is, in a 
nay, artificial and optional, as the issues overlap In some instances, it 
is really difficult to decide under which division a given aspect should be 
analysed The problems are very large, and for full discussion would 
require volumes , so we have to limit ourselves to a suggestive sketch of 
the most important aspects necessary for the present investigation. 

From the point of view of general semantics, mathematics, having 
symbols and propositions, must be considered as a language From the 
psychophysiological point of view, it must be treated as an activity of 
the human nervous system and as a form of the behaviour of the organ- 
isms called humans 

All languages are composed of two kinds of words: (1) Of names 
for the somethings on the un-speakable level, be they external obj’ects , 
or uitenial feelings, which admittedly are not words, and (2) of rela- 
tional terms, ivhich express the actual, or desired, or any other relations 
between the un-speakable entities of the objective level 

When a ‘quality’ is treated physiologically as a reaction of an organ- 
ism to a stimulus, it also becomes a relation It should be noticed that 
often some words can be, and actually are, used in both senses , but, in 
a given context, we can always, by further analysis, separate the words 
used into these two categories Numbers are not exceptions , we can 
use the labels ‘one’, ‘two’ , as numbers (of which the character will be 
explained presently) but also as names for anything we want, as, for 
instance. Second or Third Avenue, or John Smith I or John Smith II. 
When we use numbers as names, or labels for anything, we call them 
numerals, and this is not a mathematical use of ‘one’, ‘two’ , as these 
names do not follow mathematical rules Thus, Second Avenue and Third 
Avenue cannot be added together, and do not give us Fifth Avenue in 
any sense whatever 

Names alone do not produce propositions and so, by themsehes, 
say nothing Before we can have a proposition and, therefore, meanings. 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


251 


the names must be related by some relation-word, which, however, may 
be explicit or implied by the context, the situation, by established habits 
of speech The division of words into the above two classes may seem 
arbitrary, or to introduce an unnecessary complication through its sim- 
plicity, yet, if we take modern knowledge into account, we cannot fol- 
low the grammatical divisions of a primitive-made language, and such a 
division as I have suggested above seems structurally correct in 1933 
Traditionally, mathematics was divided into two branches one was 
called arithmetic, dealing with numbers, the other was called geometry, 
and dealt with such entities as ‘line’, ‘surface’, ‘volume’. Once Descartes, 
lying in bed ill, watched the branches of a tree swaying under the in- 
fluence of a breeze It occurred to him that the varying distances of the 
branches from the horizontal and vertical window frames could be 
expressed by numbers representing measurements of the distances An 
epoch-making step was taken geometrical relations were expressed by 
numerical relations, it meant the beginning of analytical geometiy and 
the unification and arithmetization of mathematics 

Further investigation by the pioneers Frege, Peano, Whitehead, 
Russell, Keyser, and others has revealed that ‘number’ can be expressed 
in ‘logical terms’ — a quite important discovery, provided we have a valid 
‘logic’ and structurally correct non-el terms 

Traditionally, too, since Aristotle, and, in the opinion of the major- 
ity, even today, mathematics is considered as uniquely connected with 
quantity and measurement Such a view is only partial, because theie 
are many most important and fundamental branches of mathematics 
which have nothing to do with quantity or measurement — as, for in- 
stance, the theory of groups, analysis situs, projective geometiy, the 
theory of numbers, the algebra of ‘logic’. 

Sometimes mathematics is spoken about as the science of relations, 
but obviously such a definition is too broad If the only content of 
knowledge is structural, then relations, obvious, or to be discovered, 
are the foundation of all knowledge and of all language, as stated iii the 
division of words given above Such a definition as suggested would 
make mathematics co-extensive with all language, and this, obviously, 
IS not the case 

Before offering a semantic definition of mathematics, I introduce 
a synoptical table taken from Professor Shaw’s The Philosophy of 
Mathematics, which he calls only suggestive and ‘doubtless incomplete 
in many ways’ I use this table because it gives a modern list of the 
most important mathematical terms and disciplines necessary for the 
purpose of this work, indicating, also, in a way, their evolution and 
structural interrelations

MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


253 


A semantic definition of mathematics may run somehow as follows : 
Mathematics consists of limited linguistic schemes of multiordinal rela- 
tions capable of exact treatment at a given date 

After I have given a semantic definition of number, it will be 
obvious that the above definition covers all existing disciplines consid- 
ered mathematical However, these developments are not fixed affairs 
Does that definition provide for their future growth? By inserting as a 
fundamental part of the definition ‘exact treatment at a given date’, it 
obviously does Whenever we discover any relations in any fields which 
will allow exact ‘logical’ treatment, such a discipline will be included in 
the body of linguistic schemes called mathematics, and, at present, there 
are no indications that these developments can ever come to an end When 
‘logic’ becomes an oo-valued ‘structural calculus’, then mathematics and 
‘logic’ will merge completely and become a general science of in o rela- 
tions and multi-dimensional order, and all sciences may become exact 

It is necessary to show that this definition is not too broad, and 
that it eliminates notions which are admittedly non-mathematical with- 
out invalidating the statement that the content of all knowledge is 
structural, and so ultimately relational The word ‘exact’ eliminates non- 
mathematical relations If we enquire into the meaning of the word 
‘exact’, we find from experience that this meaning is not constant, but 
that It varies with the date, and so only a statement ‘exact at a given 
date’ can have a definite meaning 

We can analyse a simple statement, ‘grass is green’ (the ‘is’ here is 
the ‘is’ of predication, not of identity) , vi hich, perhaps, represents an ex- 
treme example of a non-mathematical statement , but a similar reasoning 
can be applied to other examples Sometimes we have a feeling which 
we express by saying, ‘grass is green’ Usually, such a feeling is called 
a ‘perception’ But is such a process to be dismissed so simply, by just 
calling It a name, ‘perception’? It is easy to ‘call names under provoca- 
tion’, as Santayana says somewhere ; but does that exhaust the question ? 

If we analyse such a statement further, we find that it involves 
comparison, evaluation in certain respects with other characters of 
experience , and the statement thus assumes relational characteristics 
These, m the meantime, are non-exact and, therefore, non-mathematical 
If we carry this analysis still further, involving data taken from chem- 
istry, physics, physiology, neurology , we involve relations which become 
more and more exact, and, finally, in such terms as ‘wave-length’, ‘fre- 
quency’ , we reach structural terms which allow of exact 1933 treatment 
It is true that a language of ‘quality’ conceals relations, sometimes very 
effectively , but once ‘quality’ is taken as the reaction of a given organism 



254 


V MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


to a stimulus, the term used for that ‘quality' becomes a name for a very 
complex relation This procedure can be always employed, thus estab- 
lishing once more the fundamental character of relations 

These last statements are of serious structural and semantic im- 
portance, being closely connected with the A, fundamental, and unde- 
niable negative premises These results can be taught to children very 
simply , yet this automatically involves an entirely new and modern 
method of evaluation and attitude toward language, which will affect 
beneficially the, as yet entirely disregarded, j r 

We must consider, briefly, the terms ‘kind’ and ‘degree’, as we shall 
need them later Words, symbols . , serve as forms of representation and 
belong to a different universe — the ‘universe of discourse’ — since they 
are not the un-speakable levels we are speaking about They belong to 
a world of higher abstractions and not to the world of lower abstractions 
given to us by the lower nerve centres 

Common experience and scientific investigations (more refined 
experience) show us that the world around us is made up of absolute 
individuals, each different and unique, although interconnected Under 
such conditions it is obviously optional what language we use The more 
we use the language of diverse ‘kind’, the sharper our definitions must 
be Psycho-logically, the emphasis is on difference Such procedure may 
be a tax on our ingenuity, but by it we are closer to the structural facts 
of life, where, in the limit, we should have to establish a ‘kind’ for every 
individual 

In using the term ‘degree’, we may be more vague We proceed 
by similarities, but such a treatment implies a fundamental intercon- 
nection between different individuals of a special kind It implies a 
definite kind of metaphysics or structural assumptions — as, for instance, 
a theory of evolution As our ‘knowledge’ is the result of nervous 
abstracting, it seems, in accordance with the structure of our nervous 
system, to give preference to the term ‘degree’ first, and only when we 
have attained a certain order of verbal sharpness to pass to a language 
of ‘kind’, if need arises 

The study of primitive languages show^s that, historically, we had 
a tendency for the ‘kind’ language, resulting in over-abundance of names 
and few relation-words, which makes higher analysis impossible Science, 
on the other hand, has a preference for the ‘degree’ language, which, 
ultimately, leads to mathematical languages, enormous simplicity and 
economy of words, and so to better efficiency, more intelligence, and to 
the unification of science Thus, chemistry became a branch of physics ; 
physics, a branch of geometry, geometry merges with analysis, and 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


255 


analysis merges with general semantics , and life itself becomes a physico- 
chemical colloidal occurrence The language of ‘degree’ has very im- 
portant relational, quantitative, and order implications, while that of 
‘kind’ has, in the mam, qualitative implications, often, if not always, 
concealing relations, instead of expressing them. 

The current definition of ‘number’, as formulated by Frege and 
Russell, reads ‘The number of a class is the class of all those classes 
that are similar to it’ ^ This definition is not entirely satisfactory first, 
because the multiordinality of the term ‘class’ is not stated , second, it 
IS A, as it involves the ambiguous (as to the order of abstractions) term 
‘class’ What do we mean by the term ‘class’ ^ Do we mean an extensive 
array of absolute individuals, un-speakable by its very character, such as 
some seen aggregate, or do we mean the spoken definition or description 
of such un-speakable objective entities^ The term implies, then, a fun- 
damental confusion of orders of abstractions, to start with — ^the very 
issue which we must avoid most carefully, as positively demanded by the 
non-identity principle Besides, if we explore the world with a ‘class of 
classes’ , and obtain results also of ‘class of classes’, such procedure 
throws no light on mathematics, their applications and their importance 
as a tool of research Perhaps, it even increases the mysteries surround- 
ing mathematics and conceals the relations between mathematics and 
human knowledge in general 

We should expect of a satisfactory definition of ‘number’ that it 
would make the semantic character of numbers clear Somehow, 
through long experience, we have learned that numbers and measure- 
ment have some mysterious, sometimes an uncanny, importance This 
IS exemplified by mathematical predictions, which are verified later em- 
pirically Let me recall only the discovery of the planet Neptune through 
mathematical investigations, based on its action upon Uranus, long 
before the astronomer actually verified this prediction with his telescope 
Many, a great many, such examples could be given, scientific literature 
being full of them Why should mathematics and measurement be so 
extremely important^ Why should mathematical operations of a given 
Smith, which often seem innocent (and sometimes silly enough) give 
such an unusual security and such undeniably practical results ? 

Is it true that the majority of us are born mathematical imbeciles' 
Why is there this general fear of, and dislike for, mathematics^ Is 
mathematics really so difficult and repelling, or is it the way mathematics 
is treated and taught by mathematicians that is at fault? If some light 
can be throwm on these perplexing semantic problems, perhaps we shall 
face a scientific revolution which might deeply affect our educational

of evaluation, in which mathematics will take the place which it ought to 
have Certainly, there must be something the matter with our epis- 
temologies and ‘psychologies’ if they cannot cope with these problems 

A simple explanation is given by a new A analysis and a semantic 
definition of numbers What follows is written, in the mam, for non- 
mathematicians, as the word ‘semantic’ indicates, but it is hoped that 
professional mathematicians (or some, at least) may be interested in 
the meanings of the term ‘number’, and that they will not entirely dis- 
regard it As semantic, the definition seems satisfactory, but, perhaps, 
it IS not entirely satisfactory for technical purposes, and the definition 
\\ ould have to be slightly re-worded to satisfy the technical needs of the 
mathematicians In the meantime, the gains are so important that we 
should not begrudge any amount of labour in order to produce finally a 
mathematical and, this time, A semantic definition of numbers 

As has already been mentioned, the importance of notation is para- 
mount Thus the Roman notation for number — I, II, III, IV, V, VI , — 
was not satisfactory and could not have led to modern developments in 
mathematics, because it did not possess enough positional and structural 
characteiistics Modern mathematics began when it was made possible 
by the invention or discovery of positional notation We use the symbol 
‘1’ 111 1, 10, 100, 1000 , in which, because of its place, it had different 
values In the expression ‘T, the symbol means 'one unit’; in 10, the 
symbol ‘T means ten units, in 100, the symbol ‘T means one hundred 
units , . 

To have a positional notation, we need a symbol ‘O’, called zero, 
to indicate an empty column and, at least, one symbol ‘T The number 
of special symbols for ‘number’ depends on what base we accept Thus, 
in a binary system, with the base 2, our 1 is represented by 1 , our 2, 
by a unity in the second place and a zero in the first place, thus by 10 , 
our 3, by 11 , our 4, by a unity in the third place and two zeros in the 
first and second places , namely, 100, our 5, by 101 , our 6, by 110, 7. by 
111, 8, by 1000, 9, by 1001, 15, by 1111 , 16, by 10000, In a binary 

sjstem, we needed only the two symbols, 1 and 0 For a system with the 
base 3, we would need three symbols, 1, 2, 0 our 1 would be represented 
by 1 , our 2, by 2 , 3, by 10 , 4, by 1 1 , 5, by 12 , 6, by 20 , In our decimal 
system, obviously, we need 10 s)mbols, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 

For more details on notation, the interested reader is referred to 
the fascinating and elementary book of Professor Danzig, Number the 
Language of Science Here w^e only emphasize w’hat is necessary for 
our purpose Every system has its advantages and drawbacks. Thus, in

the binary system, still used by some savage tribes, of ^\hlch we retain 
traces when we speak of couples, or pairs, or braces, \\e get an enor- 
mous simplicity m operations by using only two symbols, 1 and 0 It 
should be remembered that, in every system, the tables of addition and 
multiplication must be memorized In the binary system, these tables 
are reduced to 1 -j- 1 = 10 and 1X1 = 1. while in our decimal system, 
each table has 100 entries But what we gam m simplicity by' a low base- 
number IS offset very seriously by the cumbersomeness of the notation 
As Danzig tells us, our number 4096 is represented m a binary system 
by 1,000,000,000 That we adopted the decimal system is probably a 
physiological accident, because we have ten fingers The saiage, with 
his binary system, did not reach even the finger stage , he is still in the 
fist stage. 

For practical purposes, it is simpler to have a base which has many 
divisors, as, for instance, 12 We still use this duodecimal system when 
we divide a foot into twelve inches, or a shilling into twelve pennies, or 
count by’ dozens or gross It seems that mathematicians \\ ould probably 
select a prime number for a base, but the gain uould be so slight and 
the difficulty of offsetting a phy'siological habit so tremendous, that this 
will probably never happen * 

From what was said already, it is, perhaps, clear that mathematics 
requires a positional notation in which ue must have a symbol for T’ 
and zero, at least For these and other reasons, the two numbers 1 and 
0 are somehow unusually important Even in our decimal system we 
generate numbers by adding 1 to its predecessor Thus 14-1=2, 
2 4-1 = 3 , and we must enquire into the semantic character of these 
numbers 

The notions of matching, comiiaring, measuring, quantity, equality , 
are all interwoven and, by necessity’, imolve a circularity in definitions 
and implications if the analysis is carried far enough The interested 
reader may be referred to the chapter on equality in \\'hitehead’s The 
Principle of Relativity to learn more on this subject 

In the evolution of mathematics, we find that the notions of 
‘greater’, ‘equal’, and ‘less’ precede the notion of numbers Comparison 
IS the simplest form of evaluation , the first being a search for relations , 
the second, a discovery of exact relations This process of search for 
relations and structure is inherent and natural m man, and has led not 
only to the discovery of numbers, but also has shaped their two aspects ; 
namely, the cardinal and the ordinal aspects For instance, to ascertain 
whether the number of persons in a hall is equal to, greater than, or 
less than the number of seats, it is enough to ascertain if all seats are 

17 



258 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


occupied and there are no empty seats and no persons standing ; then 
we would say that the number of persons is equal to the number of seats, 
and a symmetiical relation of equality would be established If all seats 
were occupied and there were some persons standing in the hall, or if w e 
found that no one was standing, yet not all seats were occupied, we 
would establish the asymmetrical relation of greater or less. 

In the above processes, we were using an important principle; 
namely, that of one-to-one correspondence In our search for relations, 
we assigned to each seat one person, and reached our conclusions with- 
out any counting This process, based on the one-to-one correspondence, 
establishes what is called the cardinal number It gives us specific rela- 
tional data about this world , yet it is not enough for counting and for 
mathematics To produce the latter, we must, first of all, establish a 
definite system of symbolism, based on a definite relation for generating 
numbers , for instance, 1-1-1= 2, 2-|-l=3 , which establishes a 
definite order Without this ordinal notion, neither counting nor mathe- 
matics would be possible , and, as we have already seen, order can be 
used for defining relations, as the notions of relation and order are 
interdependent Order, also, involves asymmetrical relations 

If we consider the two most important numbers, 0 and 1, we find 
that in the accepted s)mbolism, if a = b, a — & = 0, and if a = b, 
a/b — b/b = 1 , so that both fundamental numbers express, or can be 
interpreted as expressing, a symmetrical i elation of equality 

If wc consider any other number — and this applies to all kinds of 
numbers, not only to natural numbers — we find that any number is not 
altered by dividing it by one, thus, 2/1=2, 3/1=3 , m general, 
N/1 = A' : establishing the asymmetrical relation, unique and specific 
in a given case that X is A’ tunes more than one 

If we consider, further, tliat 2/1 = 2, 3/1 = 3, and so on, are all 
different, specific, and unique, ue come to an obvious and A semantic 
definition of number in terms of relations, in -which 0 and 1 represent 
unique and specific syininetrical relations and all other numbers also 
unique and specific asynimctrical relations Thus, if we ha\e a result ‘5’, 
we lan alo-vys say that the number 5 is fi%e times as many as one 
Similarly, if we introduce apples Five apples are five times as many 
as one apple Thus, a number in any form, ‘pure’ or ‘applied’, can always 
be represented as a relation, unique and specific in a given case , and this 
IS the foundation of the exactness of dealing with numbers. For in- 
stance, to say that a is greater than b also establishes an asymmetncal 
relation, but it is not unique and specific, but when we say that a is fi\e 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


259 


times greater than b, this relation is asymmetrical, exact, unique, and 
specific 

The above simple remarks are not entirely orthodox That 5/1 = 5 
IS very orthodox, indeed , but that numbers, in general, represent indefi- 
nitely many exact, specific, and unique, and, in the main, asymmetrical 
relations is a structuial notion which necessitates the revision of the 
foundations of mathematics and their rebuilding on the basis of new 
semantics and a future structural calculus When we say ‘indefinitely 
many’, this means, from the reflex point of view, ‘indefinitely flexible’, 
or ‘fully conditional’ in the semantic field, and, therefore, a prototype of 
human semantic reactions (see Part VI) The scope of the present work 
precludes the analysis of the notion of the lately disputed ‘irrational’; 
but we must state that this revision requires new psycho-logical and 
structural considerations of fundamental ‘logical’ postulates and of the 
problems of ‘infinity’ If, by an arbitrary process, we postulate the exist- 
ence of a ‘number’ which alters all the while, then, according to the 
definition given here, such expressions should be considered as functions, 
perhaps, but not as a number, because they do not give us unique and 
specific relations 

These few remarks, although suggestive to the mathematician, do 
not, in any way, exhaust the question, which can only be properly pre- 
sented in technical literature m a postulational form 

It seems that mathematicians, no matter how important the work 
which they have produced, have never gone so far as to appreciate fully 
that they are willy-nilly producing an ideal human relational language 
of structure similar to that of the world and to that of the human 
nervous system This they cannot help, in spite of some vehement 
denials, and their work should also be treated from the semantic point 
of view 

Similarly with measurement. From a functional or actional and 
semantic point of view, measurement represents nothing else but a search 
for empirical structure by means of extensional, ordered, symmetrical, 
and asymmetrical relations Thus, uhen we say that a given length 
measures five feet, we have reached this conclusion by selecting a unit 
called ‘foot’, an arbitral y and unspeakable affair, then laying it end to 
end five times in a definite extensional order and so have established the 
asymmetrical, and, in each case, unique and specific relation, that the 
given entity represents, in this case, five times as many as the arbitrarily 
selected unit 

Objection may be raised that the formal working out of a definition 
of numbers in terms of relations, instead of classes, would be very 



260 


V MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


labonous, and would also invohe a revision of the foundations of mathe- 
matics This can hardly be denied , but, in the discussions of the founda- 
tions, the confusion of orders of abstractions is still very marked, 
thereby resulting m the manufacture of artificial semantic difficulties 
Moreover, the benefits of such a definition, in eliminating the mysteries 
about mathematics, are so important that they by far outweigh the 
difficulties 

As the only possible content of knowledge is structural, as given 
in terms of relations and multiordinal and multi-dimensional order, 
numbers, which establish an endless array of exact, specific, and, m each 
case, unique, relations are obviously the most important tools for explor- 
ing the structure of the world, since structure can always be anahsed 
in terms of relations In this way, all mysteries about the importance 
of mathematics and measurement vanish The above understanding will 
give the student of mathematics an entirely different and a \ery natural 
feeling for his subject As his only possible aim is the studj" of structure 
of the world, or of whatever else, he must naturally use a relational tool 
to explore this complex of relations called ‘structure’ A most spectacu- 
lar illustration of this is guen in the internal theory of surfaces, the 
tensor calculus , described in Part VIII 

In all measurements, we select a unit of a necessary' kind, for a 
guen case, and then w'e find a unique and specific relation as expressed 
by a number, between the given something and the selected unit By 
relating different happenings and processes to the same unit-process, we 
find, again, unique and specific interrelations, in a given case, between 
these events, and so gather structural (and most important, because 
uniquely possible) wisdom, called ‘knowledge’, ‘science’, 

If we treat numbers as relations, then fractions and all operations 
become relations of relations, and so relations of higher order, into the 
analysis of which we cannot enter here, as these are, of necessity, 
technical 

It should be firmly grasped, however, that some fundamental human 
relations to this world have not been changed The primitive may have 
believed that words wei e things (identification) and so have established 
what IS called the ‘magic of words’ (and, m fact, the majority of us still 
have our j r regulated by some such unconscious identifications) , but 
in spite of this, the pnmitue or ‘civilized’ man’s words are not, and 
never could be, the things spoken about no matter what semantic dis- 
turbances we might have accompanjing their use, or what delusions or 
illusions we may cherish in respect to them 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


261 


At present, of all branches of mathematics the theory of numbers 
is probably the most difficult, obscure , and seemingly with the fewest 
applications With a new A definition of numbers in terms of relations, 
this theory may become a relational study of very high order, which, 
perhaps, will some day become the foundation for epistemology and the 
key for the solution of all the problems of science and life In the fields 
of cosmology many, if not the majority, of the problems, by necessity, 
cannot be considered as directly experimental, and so the solution must 
be epistemological 

At present, in our speculations, we are carried away by words, dis- 
regarding the simple fact that speaking about the ‘radius of the universe’, 
for instance, has no meaning, as it cannot possibly be observed Perhaps, 
some day, we shall discover that such conversations are the result of our 
old stumbling block, identification, which leads to our being carried away 
by the sounds of words applicable to terrestrial conditions but meaning- 
less in the very small, as discovered lately in the newer quantum 
mechanics, and, in the very large, as applied to the cosmos An important 
illustration of the retardation of scientific progress, blocked by the con- 
fusion of orders of abstractions, is shown in the fact that the newer 
quantum mechanics were slow in coming, and though astronomers prob- 
ably know about it, yet they still fail to grasp that expressions such as 
the ‘radius of the universe’, the ‘running down of the universe’ , are 
meaningless outside of psychopathology. 

In this connection, we should notice an extremely interesting and 
important semantic characteristic , namely, that the term ‘relation’ is not 
only multiordinal but also non-el, as it applies to ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ 
Relations are usually found empirically, so in a language of relations 
we have a language of similar structure to the world and a unique means 
for predictability and rationality 

Let me again emphasize that, from time immemorial, things have 
not been words , the only content of knowledge has been structural , 
mathematics has dealt, m the mam, with numbers, no matter whether 
we have understood the character of numbers or not, numbers have 
expressed relations and so have given us structural data willy-nilly. 
This explains why mathematics and numbers have, since time imme- 
morial, been a favorite field, not only for speculations, but also why, m 
history, we find so many religious semantic disturbances connected with 
numbers Mankind has somehow felt instinctively that m numbers we 
have a potentially endless array of unique and specific exact relations, 
which ultimately give us structure, the last being the only possible con- 
tent of knowledge, because words are not things. 



262 


V MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


As relations, generally, are empirically present, and as man and 
his ‘knowledge’ is as ‘natural’ as rocks, flowers, and donkeys, we should 
not be surprised to find that the unique language of exact , relations 
called mathematics is, by necessity, the natural language of man and 
similar in structure to the world and our nervous system 

As has already been stated, it is mcorrect to argue from the struc- 
ture of mathematical theories to the structure of the world, and so try 
to establish the similarity of structure, but that such enquiry must be 
independent and start with quite ordinary structural experiences, and 
only at a later stage proceed to more advanced knowledge as given by 
science Because this analysis must be independent, it can also be made 
very simple and elementary All exact sciences give us a wealth of 
experimental data to establish the first thesis on similarity of structure ; 
and it IS unnecessary to repeat it here I will restrict myself only to a 
minimum of quite obvious facts, reserving the second thesis — about the 
similarity of structure with our nervous system — for the next chapter 

If we analyse the silent objective level by objective means available 
in 1933, say a microscope, we shall find that whatever we can see, 
handle , represents an absolute individual, and different from anything 
else in this zvorld We discover, thus, an important structural fact of 
the external world, namely, that m it, everything we can see, touch , 
that IS to say, all lower order abstractions represent absolute individuals, 
different from everything else 

On the verbal level, under such empirical conditions, we should then 
have a language of similar structure, namely, one giving us an indefinite 
number of proper names, each different We find such a language 
uniquely in numbers, each number 1, 2, 3 , being a unique, sharply dis- 
tinguishable, proper name for a relation, and, if we wish, for anything 
else also 

Without some higher abstractions we cannot be human at all No 
science could exist with absolute individuals and no relations ; so we pass 
to higher abstractions and build a language of say x^, (j = 1, 2, 3, . n) , 
where the x shows, let us say, that we deal with a variable x with many 
values, and the number we assign to t indicates the individuality under 
consideration From the structural point of view, such a vocabulary is 
similar to the world around us , it accounts for the individuality of the 
external objects, it also is similar to the structure of our nervous sys- 
tem, because it allows generalizations or higher order abstractions, 
emphasizes the abstracting nervous characteristics , The subscript em- 
phasizes the differences , the letter x implies the similarities 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


263 


In daily language a similar device is extremely useful and has very 
far-reaching psycho-logical semantic effects Thus, if we say ‘pencili’, 
‘pencils’, . . ‘penciln’, we have indicated structurally two mam charac- 
teristics (1) the absolute individuality of the object, by adding the 
indefinitely individualizing subscript 1, 2, . n, and (2) we have also 
complied with the nervous higher order abstracting characteristics, which 
establish similarity m diversity of different ‘pencils’ From the point of 
view of relations, these are usually found empirically , besides, they may 
be invariant, no matter how changing the world may be 

In general terms, the structure of the external world is such that 
we deal always on the objective levels with absolute individuals, with 
absolute differences The structure of the human nervous system is such 
that it abstracts, or generalizes, or integrates , m higher orders, and so 
finds similarities, discovering often invariant (sometimes relatively 
invariant) relations To have ‘similar structure’, a language should com- 
ply with both structural exigencies, and this characteristic is found in 
the mathematical notation of Xt, which can be enlarged to the daily lan- 
guage as ‘Smithj’, ‘Fido,’ , where i=l, 2, 3, . , n 

Further objective enquiry shows that the world and ourselves are 
made up of processes, thus, ‘Smithiooo’ is quite a different person from 
‘Smithioas’. To be convinced, it is enough to look over old photographs 
of ourselves, the above remark being structurally entirely general A 
language of 'similar structure’ should cover these facts We find such a 
language in the vocabulary of ‘function’, ‘propositional function’, as 
already explained, involving also four-dimensional considerations 

As words are not objects — and this expresses a structural fact — we 
see that the ‘is’ of identity is unconditionally false, and should be entirely 
abolished as such Let us be simple about it This last semantic require- 
ment IS genuinely difficult to carry out, because the general el structure 
of our language is such as to facilitate identification It is admitted that 
in some fields some persons identify only a little , but even they usually 
identify a great deal when they pass to other fields Even science is not 
free from identification, and this fact introduces great and artificial 
semantic difficulties, which simply vanish when we stop identification or 
the confusion of ordeis of abstractions Thus, for instance, the semantic 
difficulties in the foundations of mathematics, the problems of ‘infinity’, 
the ‘irrational’ , the difficulties of Einstein’s theory, the difficulties of the 
newer quantum theory, the arguments about the ‘radius of the universe’, 
‘infinite velocities’, the difficulties in the present theory , , are due, in 
the main, to semantic blockages or commitment to the structure of the 
old language — we may call it ‘habit’ — which says structurally very little. 



264 


\“. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


and which I disclose as a semantic disturbance of evaluation by showing 
the physiological mechanism tn terms of order 

If we abolish the ‘is’ of identity, then we are left only with a func- 
tional, actional , language elaborated in the mathematical language of 
function Under such conditions, a descriptive language of ordered hap- 
penings on the objective lei cl takes the form of ‘if so and so happens, 
then so and so happens', or, bnefli", ‘if so, then so' , which is the proto- 
type of ‘logical’ and mathematical processes and languages We see that 
such a language is again similar in structure to the external world 
descriptively , } et it is similar to the ‘logical’ ncri ous processes, and so 
allows us, because of this similarity of structure, predictabihti' and so 
rationality 

In the traditional sj stems, we did not recognize the ifomplete seman- 
tic interdependence of differences and similarities, the empirical world 
exhibiting differences, the nenous si stem manufacturing primarili 
similarities, and our ‘knowledge', if worth anj thing at all, being the 
joint product of both A\’as it not '^yli ester who said that ‘in mathe- 
matics we look for similarities in differences and differences m similari- 
•ties’ ? This statement applies to our \i hole abstracting process 

The empirical world is such in structure (by inspection) that in it 
we can add, subtract, multiply, and dnide In mathematics, we find a 
language of similar structure Obiiously, in the physical world these 
actions or operations alter the relations, w'hich are expressed as altered 
unique and specific relations, hi- the language of mathematics Further, as 
the world is full of different shapes forms, curies , we do not only find 
in mathematics special languages dealing with these subjects, but we find 
in analytical geometry unifying linguistic means for translation of one 
language into another Thus am ‘quality’ can be formulated in terms 
of relations w hich may take the ‘quantitative’ character which, at present, 
in all cases, can be also translated into geometrical terms and methods, 
giving structures to be visualized 

It IS interesting, > et not entirely unexpected, that the actinties of the 
higher nervous centres, the conditional reflexes of higher order, the 
semantic reactions, time-binding included, should folloiv the exponential 
rules, as shown in my Manhood of Humanity 

In our experience, we find that some issues are additive — as, for 
instance, if one guest is added to a dinner party, we will have to add 
plates and a chair Such facts are covered by additive methods and the 
language called ‘linear’ (see Part VIII) In many instances — and these 
are, perhaps, the most important and are strictly connected with sub- 
microscopic processes — ^the issues are not additive, one atom of oxygen 



MATHEMATICS AND THE WORLD 


265 


‘plus’ two atoms of hydrogen, under proper conditions, will produce 
water, of which the characteristics are not the sum of the characteristics 
of oxygen and hydrogen ‘added’ together, but entirely nezu characteristics 
emerge These may some day be taken care of by non-linear equations, 
when our knowledge has advanced considerably These problems are 
unusually important and vital, because with our present low dei elopment 
and the lack of structural researches, we still keep an additive A lan- 
guage, which IS, perhaps, able to deal with additive, simple, immediate, 
and comparatively unimportant issues, but is entirely unfit structurally 
to deal with principles which underlie the most fundamental problems of 
life Similarly, in physics, onlj’ since Einstein have we begun to see that 
the primitive, simplest, and easiest to solve linear equations are not 
structurally adequate 

One of the most marked structural characteristics of the empirical 
world IS ‘change’, ‘motion’, ‘wa\es’, and similar dvnamic manifestations 
Obviously, a language of similar stiucture must have means to deal with 
such relations In this respect, mathematics is unique, because, in the 
differential and integral calculus, the four-dimensional geometries and 
similar disciplines, with all their deielopments, we find such a perfect 
language to be explained more in detail in the chapters which follow 

It will be profitable for our purpose to discuss, m the next chapter, 
some of the mathematical structural characteristics in connection with 
their similarity to the human nervous system , but here I will add only 
that, for our purposes, at this particular point, we must specially empha- 
size arithmetical language, which means numbers and arithmetical opera- 
tions, the theory of function, the differential and integral calculus 
(language) and different geometries in their two aspects, ‘pure’ and 
applied Indeed, Riemann tells us bluntly that the science of physics 
originated only with the introduction of differential equations, a state- 
ment which IS quite justified, but to which I w'ould add, that physics is 
becoming scientific since we began to eliminate from physics semantic 
disturbances, namely, identification and elementalism This movement 
was originated, in fact, although not stated in an explicit form, by the 
Einstein theory and the new quantum theories, the pS) cho-logical trend 
of which IS formulated m a general semantic theoiy m the present work 

It IS reasonable to consider that metric geometry, and, in particular, 
the £-system, was derived from touch, and, perhaps, the ‘kinesthetic 
sense’, and projective geometry from sight 

Although the issues presented here appear extremely simple, and 
sometimes even commonplace, yet the actual working out of the verba!

schemes is quite elaborate and ingenious, and impossible to analyse here 
more fully; so that only one example can be given 

The solution of mathematical equations is perhaps to be considered 
as the central problem of mathematics The word ‘equation’ is derived 
from Latin aeqiiare, to equalize, and is a statement of the symmetrical 
relation of equality expressed as a — b or a — b = 0 or afb = l An 
equation expresses the relation between quantities, some of which are 
known, some unknown and to be found By the solution of an equation, 
we mean the finding of values for the unknowns which will satisfy 
the equation 

Linear equations of the type ax = b necessitated the introduction of 
fractions Linear equations with several variables led to the theory of 
determinants and matrices , which underwent, later, a tremendous inde- 
pendent development , yet they originated in the attempt to simplify the 
solution of these equations 

Quadratic equations of the type o-x b = Q can be reduced 
to the form S'~A, the solution of which depends on the extraction of 
a square root Here, serious difficulties arose, and seemingly necessitated 
the introduction of ‘irrational’ numbers and ordinary complex numbers, 
involving the square root of minus one (V — 1 = *)> a notion which 
revolutionized mathematics 

Cubic equations of the form a-® -)- ^ = 0 necessitated 
the extraction of cube roots, m addition to the problems connected with 
the solution of quadratic equations, and involved more difficulties, which 
have been analysed m an extensive literature. 

Biquadratic equations of the type A'* + oa’® fcA® + c.r -|- d = 0 
involve the problems of quadratic and cubic equations When we con- 
sider equations of a degree higher than the fourth, we find that we 
cannot solve them by former methods , and mathematicians have had to 
invent theories of substitutions, groups, different special functions and 
similar devices The solution of difilerential equations introduced further 
difficulties, allied with the theory of function 

Ihe linear transformations of algebraic polynomials with two or 
more variables in connection with the theory of determinants, symmetri- 
cal functions, differential operations , necessitated the development of an 
extensive theory of algebraic forms which, at present, is far from 
being complete 

In the above analysis, I have refrained from giving details, most 
of which would be of no value to the layman, and unnecessary for the 
mathematician; but it must be emphasized that the theory of function 
and the theory of groups, with their very extensive developments,

involving the theory of invariance, and, in a ^vay, the theory of numbers, 
rapidly became a unifying foundation upon uhich practically the whole 
of mathematics is being rebuilt. Many branches of mathematics have 
become, of late, nothing more than a theory of invariance of special 
groups 

As to practical applications, there is no possibility to list them, and 
the number increases steadily But, without the theory of analytic func- 
tion, for instance, we could not study the flow of electricity, or heat, or 
deal with two-dimensional grar'itational, electrostatic, or magnetic attrac- 
tions The complex number involving the square root of minus one was 
necessary for the development of wireless and telegraphy; the kinetic 
theory of gases and the building of automobile engines require geome- 
tries of n dimensions, rectangular and triangular membranes aie con- 
nected with questions discussed in the theory of numbers , the theory of 
groups has direct application in crystallography , the theory of invariants 
underlies the theory of Einstein, the theory of matrices and operators 
has revolutionized the quantum theory' , and there are other applications 
in an endless array ® 

In Part VIII, different aspects of mathematics are analysed, but the 
interested reader can be referred also to the above-mentioned book of 
Professor Shaw for an excellent elementary, yet structural, view of the 
progress of mathematics.

TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM 


In recent times the view becomes more and more prevalent that many 
branches of mathematics are nothing but the theory of invariants of special 
groups. s LIE 

A natural law, — if, strictly speaking, there be such a thing outside the 
conception thereof, — is fundamentally nothing more nor less than a con- 
stant connection among inconstant phenomena it is, in other words, an 
invariant relation among variant terms i 264 ) C.tssius j keyser 

Whatsoever things are invariant under all and only the transformations 
of some group constitute the peculiar subject-matter of some (actual or 
potential) branch of knowledge (264) c.vssius j keyser 

The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold 
good for all systems of co-ordinates, that is, are co-variant with respect to 
any substitutions whatever (generally co-variant) iissj A einstein 

The things hereafter called tensors are further characterized bj the fact 
that the equations of transformation for their components are linear and 
homogeneous Accordingly, all the components m the new s> stem vanish, 
if they all vanish in the original system If, therefore, a law of nature is 
expressed by equating all the components of a tensor to zero, it is generally 
covariant. By examining the laws of the formation of tensors, we acquire 
the means of formulating generall> covariant laws (iss) a einsteik

Section A Introductory 

It becomes increasinglj' endent that we have come to a linguistic 
impasse, reflected in our historical, cultural, economic, social, doctrinal , 
impasses, all these issues being interconnected The structural linguistic 
aspect is the most fundamental of them all, as it underlies the others and 
involv es the j r, or psycho-logical responses to words and other events in 
connection u ith meanings 

One of the benefits of building a system on undeniable negative 
premises is that many older and controversial problems become relatively 
simple and often uncontroversial, disclosing an important psycho-logical 
mechanism Such formulations have often the appearance of the 'discov^- 
ery of the obvious’ , but it is known, in some quarters, that the discovery 
of the obvious is sometimes useful, not always easy, and often much 
delayfed, as, for instance, the discovery of the equality of gravitational 
and inertial mass, which has lately revolutionized physics

As words are not the things we are talking about, the only possible 
link between the objective world and the verbal world is structural If 
the two structures are similar, then the empirical world becomes intelli- 
gible to us — ^we ‘understand’, we can adjust ourselves , If we carry out 
verbal experiments and predict, these predictions are verified empirically 
If the two structures are not similar, then our predictions are not verified 
— we do not ‘know’, we do not ‘understand’, the given problems are 
‘unintelligible' to us , we do not know what to do to adjust ourselves, 

Psycho-logically, in the first case w'e feel security, w’e are satisfied, 
hopeful , in the second case, w^e feel insecure, a floating anxiety fear, 
worry, disappointment, depression, hopelessness, and other harmful s r 
appear The considerations of structure thus disclose an unexpected and 
powerful semantic mechanism of individual and collective happiness, 
adjustment , but also of tragedies, suppljing us with physiological means 
for a certain amount of desirable control, because relations and structure 
represent fundamental factors of all meanings and evaluations, and, 
therefore, of all 

The present increasing world unrest is an excellent example of this. 
The structure of our old languages has shaped our s r and suggested our 
doctrines, creeds , which build our institutions, customs, habits and, 
finally, lead fatalistically to catastrophes like the World War We have 
learned long ago, by repeated sad experience, that predictions concerning 
human affairs are not verified empirically Our doctrines, institutions, 
and other disciplines are unable somehow to deal with this semantic 
situation, and hence the prevailing depression and pessimism 

We hear everywhere complaints of the stupidity or dishonesty of 
our rulers, as already defined, without realizing that although our rulers 
are admittedly very ignorant, and often dishonest, yet the most informed, 
gifted, and honest among them cannot predict or foresee happenings, if 
their arguments are perfoimed in a language of a structure dissimilar 
to the world and to our nervous system Under such conditions, calling 
names, even under proi ocations, is not constructive or helpful enough 
Arguments m the languages of the old structure have led fatalistically to 
systems w'hich are structurally ‘un-natural’ and so must collapse and 
impose unnecessary and artificial stress on our nervous system The self- 
imposed conditions of life become more and more unbearable, resulting 
m the increase of ‘mental’ illness, prostitution, criminality, brutality, 
Molence, suicides, and similar signs of maladjustment It should never 
be forgotten that human endurance has limits Human ‘knowledge’ 
shapes the human world, alters conditions, and other features of the

enviionment — a factor which docs not exist to any such extent in the 
animal world 

We often speak about the influence of heredity, but much less do 
we anal}se what influence environment, and particularly the verbal 
environment, has upon us Not only are all doctrines verbal, but the 
structure of an old language reflects the structural metaphysics of bygone 
generations, which affect the s r The vicious circle is complete Primi- 
tive mythology shaped the structure of language In it we have discussed 
and argued our institutions, sj stems , and so again the primitive struc- 
tural assumptions or mythologies influenced them It should not be for- 
gotten that the affective interplay, interaction, interchange is ever present 
in human life, excepting, perhaps, in severe and comparatively rare (not 
in all countnes) ‘mental’ ills We can stop talking, we can stop reading 
or writing, and stop any ‘intellectual’ interplay and interaction between 
individuals, but we cannot stop or entirely abolish some jr. 

A structural linguistic readjustment will, it is true, result in making 
the majority of our old doctrines untenable, leading also to a funda- 
mental scientific reiision of new doctrines and systems, affecting all of 
them and our jr in a constructne way It is incorrect, for instance, to 
use the terms ‘capitalism’ as opposed to ‘socialism’, as these terms apply 
to different non-directly comparable aspects of the human problem If 
we wish to use a term emphasizing the symbolic character of human rela- 
tions, W'e can use the term ‘capitalism’, and then we can contrast directly 
indnidual, group, national, international., capitalisms If we want to 
emphasize the psycho-logical aspects, we can speak of individualism 
versus socialism , Ob^ lously, m life the issues o\ erlap, but the verbal 
implications remain, preventing clarity and inducing inappropriate sr 
in any discussion 

In vernacular terras, there is at present a ‘struggle’ and ‘competition’ 
between two entirely different ‘industnahsms’ and two different ‘com- 
mercialisms’, based ultimately on two different forms of ‘capitalism’. 
One is the ‘individual capitalism’, rapidly being transformed into ‘group 
capitalism’, in the mam advanced theoretically to its limits in the 
United States of America and to a lesser extent m the rest of the civil- 
ized world, and ‘social capitalism’, proclaimed in the United Socialistic 
Soviet Republics Both these extreme tendencies, connected also wnth 
semantic disturbances, are due to a %erbal or doctrinal ‘declaration of 
independence’ of twm, until lately, much isolated countries The United 
States of America proclaimed the doctrine that man is ‘free and inde- 
pendent’, while, in fact, he is not free, but is inherently intei dependent 
The So\ lets accepted uncritically an unrevised antiquated doctrine of the 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 271 


‘dictatorship of the proletarians’ In piacticc, this would mean the dic- 
tatorship of unenlightened masses, which, if left actually to their creeds, 
and deprived of the brain-work of scientists and leaders, would revert 
to primitive forms of animal life Obviously, these two extreme creeds 
violate every typically human characteristic We are interdependent, time- 
binders, and we are interdependent because we possess the higher ner- 
vous centres, which complexity animals do not possess Without these 
higher centres, we could not be human at all, both countries seem to 
disregard this fact, as in both the brain-work is exploited, yet the brain- 
workers are not properly evaluated The ignorant mob, v\ith its his- 
torically and psycho-logically cultnated animalistic sr, retards human 
progress and agreement Leaders do not lead, but the majority play 
down to the mob psycho-logics, m fear of their heads or stomachs 

In both countries, the sr are such that bram-work, although com- 
mercially exploited, is not properly evaluated, and is still persecuted 
here and there For instance, in the United States of America, we 
witness court trials and resolutions against the work of Darwin, in spite 
of the fact that without some theory of evolution most of the natural 
saences, medicine included, would be impossible. In Russia, we find 
decrees against researches in pure science, without uhich modern science 
is impossible. Both countries seemingly forget that all ‘material’ progress 
among humans is due uniquely to the brain-work of a few mostly under- 
paid and overworked workers, who exercise properly their higher ner- 
vous centres With science getting hold of problems of jr and sanity, 
our human relations and individual happiness will also become the sub- 
ject matter of scientific enquiry If international and interdependent 
brain-workers produce discoveries and inventions, any one, even of the 
lowest development, can use or misuse their achievements, no matter 
what 'plan', or ‘no-plan’, is adopted Both countries seem at present not 
to understand that a great development of mechanical means and the 
application of scientific achievements exclusively for animal comfort fail 
to lead to greater happiness or higher culture, and that, perhaps, indeed, 
they lead in just the opposite direction Personally, I have no doubt that 
some day they will understand it, but an earlier understanding of this 
simple semantic fact would have saved, in the meantime, a great deal of 
suffering, bewilderment, and other semantic difficulties to a great num- 
ber of people, if the rulers in both countries would be enlightened enough 
and could have foreseen it soon enough 

The future will witness a struggle between the individual and group 
capitalism, as exemplified in the United States of America, and the collec- 
tive or social capitalism, as exemplified in the Soviet Republics It does

not require prophetic vision to foresee that some trends of history arc 
foregone conclusions because of the structure of the human nervous 
s}stem As trusts or groups have replaced the theoretically ‘individual’ 
capitalism in the United States of America, so will the state capitalism 
replace the trusts, to be replaced in its turn by international capitalism 
\\’e are not shocked by the international character of science We 
are not ‘100 per cent patriotic’ when it comes to the use in daily life of 
discoveries and in\ entions of other nations Science is a semantic prod- 
uct of a general human symbolic characteristic, so, naturally, it must be 
general and, therefore, ‘international’ But ‘capitalism’ is also a unique 
and general semantic product of s\mbohsm, it is also a unique product 
of the human nervous S3'stem, dependent on mathematics, and, as such, 
bj' its inherent character, must become some day international There is 
no reason why our s r should be disturbed in one case more than in the 
other The ultimate problem is not w'hether to ‘abolish capitalism’ or not, 
which will never happen in a s}mbohc class of life, but to transfer the 
control from prnate, socially irresponsible, uncontrolled, and mostly 
Ignorant, leaders to more responsible, professionally trained, and socially 
controlled public serz'ants, not bosses If a country cannot produce 
honest, intelligent, and scientifically trained public men and leaders, that 
is, of course, ^ery disastrous for its citizens, but this is not to be pro- 
claimed as a rule, because it is an exception Thus, m the Soviet Repub- 
lics, graft IS practically non-existent in the sense that it exists m the 
United States, but the mentality of the public men is practically at a 
similar standstill because of a deliberate minimizing of the value of brain- 
work I wonder if it is realized at all, in either country, that any ‘manual 
worker’, no matter how lowly, is hired exclusively for his human brain, 
his j r, and not primarily for his hands * 

The only problem which the rest of mankind has to face is how' this 
struggle w'lll be managed and how long it will last, the outcome admitting 
of no doubt, as the ruthless elimination of individual capitalism b\" group 
capitalism (trusts) in the United States is an excellent example In the 
Soviet Republics, they simph have gone further, but in a similar direc- 
tion Struggles mean suffering , and w e should reconcile ourselves to that 
fact If we want the minimum of suffering, we should stop the animal- 
istic methods of contest Human methods of solving problems depend on 
higher order abstractions, scientific investigations of structure and lan- 
guage, revision of our doctrines , resulting in peaceful adjustment of 
living facts, which are actualities w'hether we like it or not If w'e want 
the maximum of suffering, let us proceed in the stupid, blind, animal- 
istic and unscientific way of trial and error, as we are doing at present 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 273 


My aim is not to be a prophet, but to analyse different structural 
and linguistic semantic issues underlying all human activities, and so 
to produce material which may help mankind to select their lot con- 
sciously What they will do is not my official concern, but it seems that 
both countries, which have so much in common, and which are bound to 
play an important role in the future of mankind, owing to their numbers, 
their areas, and their natural resources , will have to pay more attention 
to the so-called ‘intellectual' issues, or, more simply, not disregard the 
difference between the reactions of infants and adults Otherwise, very 
serious and disastrous cultural results for all of us will follow 

The problems of the world 1933 are acute and immediate, over- 
loaded with confusion, bitterness, hopelessness, and other forms of 
semantic disturbances Without some means — and, in this case, scien- 
tific and physiological means — ^to regulate our sr, we shall not be able 
to solve our problems soon enough to avoid disasters The similarity in 
structure of mathematics, and our nervous system, once pointed out and 
applied, gives us a unique means to regulate the sr, without which it 
is practically impossible to analyse dispassionately and wisely the most 
pressing problems of immediate importance 

The present investigation shows that the old languages which, in 
structure, are not similar to the world and our nervous system, have 
automatically reflected their structure on our doctrines, creeds, and habits, 
sr, and also on those man-made institutions which result from verbal 
arguments These, in turn, shape further s r and, as long as they last, 
control our destinies 

Four important issues could be shown in detail, but, for lack of 
space, I give only a suggestive sketch of them here 

1) In the -system, all our existing older sub-systems, with all 
their benefits as well as shortcomings, follow as an A psycho-logical 
structural semantic necessity 

2) The tremendous handicap for any new and less deficient sys- 
tems consists m the fact that such systems lack new consti uctive 
00 -valued semantics, and are carried on the one side by linguistic two- 
valued arguments in the language of old el structure, yet they aspire 
‘emotionally’ to something new and better, while the two cannot be 
reconciled 

3) An argument carried on m the old el and two-valued way, no 
matter how fundamentally true and eventually beneficial, can be easily 
defeated on verbal grounds if it follows the old structure of language 
Our decisions are never well-grounded psycho-logically, and so can 
never command the respect or achieve the reliability of scientific reason-

mg. That is why wc arc groping — ^the only method possible under such 
conditions being the animalistic trial-and-error methods, swaying masses 
by inflammatory speeches because reason has nothing to offer, being tied 
up by the old verbal structure to the older consequences based on animal- 
istic and fundamentally false-for-man assumptions 

4) In the old A, el, two-valued system, agreement is theoretically 
impossible, so one of the mam, and peihaps revolutionary, semantic 
departures from the old system is the fact that a non-el ao-valued A- 
system, based on fundamental negative premises, leads to a theory of 
universal agreement, which is based on a structural revision of our 
languages, producing new and undisturbed sr, which eliminate the 
copying of animals m our nervous reactions 

The subject matter of this chapter divides, naturally, into three 
interconnected semantic parts In the first, w e shall recall a few' general 
notions, know'n in the mam but seldom taken into consideration, reformu- 
lated in a language of different structure In the second, I shall indicate 
how the most important mathematical disciplines, which traditionally 
and, in the opinion of the majority, could hardly be called mathematical, 
represent a scientific and exact formulation of the general ‘thinking’ 
process In this connection, a few words will be said about the theory 
of aggregates, and a little more about the theory of groups This latter 
theory, with its implications and applications, leads to a reformulation 
of mathematics on quite ob\ious psycho-Zopicaf grounds, bringing mathe- 
matics into the closest relationship to the general processes of mentation 
Finally', in the third part, I shall indicate the astonishing and quite unex- 
pected physiological fact of the similarity of the structure of mathematics 
w ith the structure and function of our nervous system 

The intelligent layman should be reminded that, although he needs 
to know about mathematics, the minimum given here, supplemented, 
perhaps, by a few most elementary and fascinating books on mathemat- 
ical philosophy, given in the bibliography to this volume, yet he does not 
need, and probably never will need, more technical mathematics than is 
given m the high schools and supplemented by the fundamental notions 
of the differential calculus For directly w'C treat all languages, mathe- 
matics included, from a more general (and, at present, perhaps, the most 
general) aspect, namely, structure, the reader will obtain all the essen- 
tial psycho-logical benefits of modern science by absorbing the .(4-system 
and habits, which will result in completely novel standards of evaluation 
and distinctly modern and adult i r 

The last is of extreme and unrealized importance In fact, its impor- 
tance cannot be fully appreciated until we actually acquire such reactions. 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 275 


because only then shall we have semantic disturbances eliminated, so that 
all problems can be analysed properly, and, therefore, agreement must 
be reached 

The future generations, of course, will have no difficulties whatso- 
ever in establishing the healthy sr , neither at present have very young 
children These do not need such treatises as the present work But, 
before the grown-up parents or teacliers can tram their children, they 
must first unlearn a great deal and tram themselves to new habits involv- 
ing the A standards of evaluation So, for them, such a book, in order to 
be convincing, must deal with the foundations of their difficulties The 
last task is difficult for the writer as well for the reader 

What has been said here does not apply, I am sorry to say, to 
professional ‘philosophers’, ‘logicians’, ‘psychologists’, psychiatrists, and 
teachers These, to he adequate at all for their responsible and difficult 
professional duties, must become thoroughly acquainted with structure 
in general, and with the structure of mathematics in particular, as factors 
in s r, and must work out the present outline much further 

Section B. General 

Mathematics in the twentieth century is characterized by an enor- 
mous productiveness, by the revision of its foundations, and the quest 
for rigour, all of which implies material of great and unexplored psycho- 
logical value, a result of the activity of the human nervous system 
Branches of mathematics, as, for instance, mathematical ‘logic’, or the 
analytical theory of numbers, have been created in this period, others, 
like the theory of function, have been revised and reshaped The theory 
of Einstein and the newer quantum mechanics have also suggested 
further needs and developments 

Any branch of mathematics consists of propositional functions 
which state certain structural relations The mathematician tries to dis- 
cover new characteristics and to reduce the known characteristics to a 
dependence on the smallest possible set of constantly revised and simplest 
structural assumptions Of late, we have found that no assumption is 
ever ‘self-evident’ or ultimate 

To those structural assumptions, we give at present the more polite 
name of postulates These involve undefined terms, not always stated 
explicitly, but always present implicitly A postulate system gives us 
the structure of the linguistic scheme The older mathematicians were 
less particular m their methods Their primitive propositional functions 
or postulates were less well investigated They did not start explicitly 
with undefined terms The twentieth century has witnessed in this field 



276 


V. MATHEilATICS A A LANGUAGE 


a marked progress in mathematics, though much less in other verba! 
enterprises , which accounts for the long neglect of the structure of lan- 
guages Without tracing down a linguistic scheme to a postulate s} stem, 
it is extremely difficult or impossible to find its structural assumptions 

A peculiarity of modern mathematics is the insistence upon the 
formal character of all mathematical reasoning which, with the new 
non-el theoiy' of meanings, ultimately should apply to all linguistic 
procedures 

The problems of ‘formalism* are of serious and neglected psycho- 
logical importance, and are connected with great semantic dangers in 
daily life if associated with the lack of consciousness of abstracting , or, 
in other words, when we confuse the orders of abstractions Indeed, the 
majority of ‘mentally’ ill are too fomtal in their psycho-logical, one-, 
two-, or few-valued processes and =0 cannot adjust themselves to the 
x-valued experiences of hie Formalism is only useful in the search for, 
and test of, structure , but, in that case, the consciousness of abstracting 
makes the attitude behind formal reasoning x.-valucd and probable, so 
that semantic disturbances and shocks in life are avoided Let us be 
simple about it the mechanism of the semantic disturbance, called 
‘identification’, or ‘the confusion of orders of abstractions' in general, 
and ‘objectification’ in particular, is to a large extent, dependent on two- 
talued formalism without the consciousness of abstracting 

In mathematics formalism is uniquely useful and necessary In 
mathematics, the formal point of view is pressed so far as to disclaim 
that anj meanings, in the ordinar)- sense, have been ascribed to the 
undefined terms, the emphasis being on the postulated relations between 
the undefined terms The last makes the majority of mathematicians able 
to adjust themselves, and mathematics extremely general, as it allows us 
to ascribe to the mathematical postulates an indefinite number of mean- 
ings which satisfy the postulates 

This fact IS not a defect of mathematics . quite the opposite It is 
the basis of its tremendous practical value It makes mathematics a 
linguistic scheme which embodies the possibility of perfection, and 
which, no doubt, satisfies sernanticalh , at each epoch, the great maj'onty 
of properly informed individual Smiths and Browns There is nothing 
absolute about it, as all mathematics is ultimately a product of the human 
nerv ous sv stem the best product produced at each stage of our develop- 
ment The fact that mathematics establishes such linguistic relational 
patterns without specific content, accounts for the generality of mathe- 
matics in applications 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 277 


If mathematics had physical content or a definite meaning ascribed 
to its undefined terms, such mathematics could be applied only m the 
given case and not otheiwise If, instead of making the mathematical 
statement that one and one make two, without mentioning what the one 
or the two stands for, we should establish that one apple and one 
apple make two apples, this statement would not be applied safely to 
anything else but apples The generality would be lost, the validity of 
the statement endangered, and we should be deprived of the greatest 
value of mathematics Such a statement concerning apples is not a 
mathematical statement, but belongs to wbat is called ‘applied mathe- 
matics’, which has content Such experimental facts as that one gallon 
of water added to one gallon of alcohol gnes less than two gallons of 
the mixture, do not invalidate the mathematical statement that one and 
one make two, wdiich remains valid by definition The last mentioned ex- 
periment with the ‘addition’ of water to alcohol is a deep sub-microscopic 
structural characteristic of the empirical world, which must be discovered 
at present by experiment The most we can say is that we find the 
above mathematical statement applicable in some instances, and non- 
applicable in others 

Not assigning definite meanings to the undefined terms, mathemat- 
ical postulates have variable meanings and so consist of propositional 
functions Mathematics must be viewed as a manifold of patterns of 
exact relational languages, representing, at each stage, samples of the best 
working of the human ‘mind’ The application to practical problems 
depends on the ingenuity of those desiring to use such languages 

Because of these characteristics, mathematics, when studied as a 
form of human behaviour, gives us a wealth of psycho-logical and 
semantic data, usually entirely neglected 

As postulates consist of propositional functions with undefined 
terms, all mathematical proof is formal and depends exclusively on the 
form of the premises and not on special meanings which we may assign 
to our undefined terms This applies to all ‘proof’ ‘Theories’ represent 
linguistic structures, and must be proved on semantic grounds and never 
by empirical ‘facts’ Experimental facts only make a theory more 
plausible, but no number of expenments can ‘prove’ a theoiy A proof 
belongs to the verbal level, the experimental facts do not , they belong to 
a different order of abstractions, not to be reached by language, the 
connecting link being structure, which, in languages, is gi\en by the 
systems of postulates 

Theories or doctrines are always linguistic They formulate some- 
thing which IS going on inside our skin in relation to what is going on

\\ MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


on the un-speakable levels, and which is not a theorj’. Theones are the 
rational means for a rational being to be as rational as he possibly can 
As a fact of experience, the working of the human nen’ous s\stem is 
such that w e have theones Such was the surH\'al trend ; and we must 
not only reconcile ourseh es with this fact, but must also investigate the 
structure of theones 

Theories are the result of extremely complex cjxlic chains of nenx 
currents of the human ner\ous system Any semantic disturbance, be it 
a confusion of orders of abstractions, or identification, or any of their 
progeny, called 'elementalism’, ‘absolutism’, ‘dogmatism’, ‘finalism , 
introduces some deviations or resistances, or semantic blockages of the 
normal surviial cycles, and the organism is at once on the abnormal 
non-adjustment path 

The structure of protoplasm of the simplest kind, or of the most 
elaborate nen'ous system, is such that it abstracts and reacts in its own 
specific way to different external and intemal stimuli. 

Our ‘experience’ is based normally on abstractions and integrations 
of different stimuli by different receptors, with different and specific 
reactions The e) e produces its share, and we may see a stone , but the 
eje does not convey to us the feel of weight of the stone, or its tem- 
perature, or its hardness , To get this new' wisdom, we need other 
receptors of an entirely different kind from those the eye can suppl.v 
If the eye plajs some role in establishing the w'eight, for instance, with- 
out ever giving the actual feci of weight, it is usually misleading. If we 
would trj' to lift a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, w'hich the 
balance would register as of equal w'eight, the pound of lead w'ould feel 
heavier to us than the pound of feathers The eye saw- that the pound 
of lead is smaller in bulk, and so the doctrinal, semantic, and muscular 
expectation w'as for a smaller weight, and so, by contrast, the pound 
of lead w'ould appear unexpected!} heav}'. 

As the ej-e is one of the most subtle organs in fact, a part of the 
brain, science is devising methods to bring all other characteristics of the 
external w'orld to direct or indirect inspection of the eye We build bal- 
ances, thermometers, microscopes, telescopes, and other instruments, but 
the character and feel of w eight, or warmth , must be supplied directly 
by the special receptors, w'hich uniquely can produce the special ‘sensa- 
tions’ The swinging of the balance, or the rise of the column of the 
thermometer, establishes most important relations, but does not give the 
immediate specific and un-speakable feel of ‘w'eight’ or of ‘warmth’ 
Our first and most primitive contact w'ith a stone, its feel , is a persona! 
abstraction from the obj'ect, full of characteristics supplied by the 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 279 


peculiarities of the special receptors Our primitive picture ‘stone’ is a 
summary, an integration, of all these separate ‘sense’ abstractions. It is 
an abstraction from many abstractions, or an abstraction of a higher 
order 

Theories are relational or structural verbal schemes, built by a 
process of high abstractions from many lower abstractions, which are 
produced not only by ourselves but by others (time-binding) Theories, 
therefore, represent the shortest, simplest structuial summaries and gen- 
eralizations, or the highest abstractions from individual experience and 
through symbolism of racial past experiences Theories are mostly not 
an individual, but a collective, product They follow a more subtle but 
inevitable semantic survival trend, like all life Human races and epochs 
which have not revised or advanced their theories have either perished, 
or are perishing 

The process of abstracting in different orders being inherent in the 
human nervous system, it can neither be stopped nor abolished, but it 
can be deviated, vitiated, and forced into harmful channels contrary to 
the survival trend, particularly in connection with pathological sr No 
one of us, even when profoundly ‘mentally’ ill, is free from theories 
The only selection we can make is between antiquated, often primitive- 
made, theories, and modern theories, which always involve important 
semantic factors 

The understanding of the above is of serious importance, as, by 
proper selection of theories, all wasteful semantic disturbances, which 
lead even to crimes, and such historical examples of human un-sanity as 
the ‘holy inquisition’, burning at the stake, religious wars, persecution of 
science, the Tennessee trial , could have been avoided 

Whenever awy one says anything, he is indulging in theories A 
similar statement is true of writing or ‘thinking’ We must use terms, 
and the very selection of our terms and the structure of the language 
selected reflect their structure on the subject under discussion Besides, 
words are not the events Even simple ‘descriptions’, since they involve 
terms, and ultimately undefined terms, involve structural assumptions, 
postulates, and theories, conscious or unconscious — at present, mostly 
the latter 

It IS very harmful to sanity to teach a disregard for theories or 
doctrines and theoretical work, as we can never get away from them as 
long as we are humans If we disregard them, we only build for our- 
selves semantic disturbances The difference between morbid and not so 
obviously morbid confusions of orders of abstractions is not very clear 
The strong affective components of such semantic disturbances must

V MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


lead to absolutism, dogmatism, finalism, and similar states, which are 
semantic factors out of which states of un-samty are built 

We know that we must start with undefined terms, which may be 
defined at some other date in other undefined terms At a given date, our 
undefined terms must be treated as postulates If we prefer, we may 
call them structural assumptions or hypotheses From a theoretical point 
of view, these undefined terms represent not only postulates but also 
variables, and so generate propositional functions and not propositions 
In mathematics, these issues are clear and simple Every theory is ulti- 
mately based on postulates which consist of propositional functions con- 
taining variables, and which express relations, indicating the structure of 
the scheme 

It appears that the mam importance of the linguistic higher order 
abstractions is in their public character, for they are capable of being 
transmitted in neural and extra-neural forms But our private lives are 
influenced also very much by the low'er order abstractions, ‘feelings’, 
‘intuitions’. These can be, should be, but seldom are, properly influenced 
by the higher order abstractions These ‘feelings’ , are personal, un- 
speakable, and so are non-transmittable For instance, we cannot trans- 
mit the actual feeling of pain when we burn ourselves, but we can 
transmit the invariant relation of the extremely complex fire-flesh-nerve- 
pain manifold A relation is present empirically, but also can be expressed 
by words It seems important to have means to translate these higher 
order abstractions into lower, and this will be the subject of Part \'’II 

Section C The psycho-logical importance of the theory of aggregates 
and the theory of groups 

Starting wdth the A denial of identity, we were compelled to con- 
sider structure as the only possible link betw'een the empirical and the 
verbal worlds The analysis of structure involved relations and m o and 
multi-dimensional order, and, ultimately, has led us to a semantic defini- 
tion of mathematics and numbers These definitions make it obvious 
that all mathematics expresses general processes of mentation par excel- 
lence We could thus review all mathematics from this psycho-logical 
point of view, but this would not be profitable for our purpose , so we 
will limit ourselves to a brief sketch connected wuth the theory of aggre- 
gates and the theory of groups, because these tw o fundamental and most 
general theories formulate in a crisp form the general psycho-logical 
process, and also show the mechanism by which all languages (not only 
mathematics) ha\e been built Besides, with the exception of a few' 
specialists, the general public is not even aware of the existence of such 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 281 


disciplines which depart widely from traditional notions about mathe- 
matics They represent most successful and powerful attempts at build- 
ing exact relational languages m subjects which are on the border-line 
between psycho-logics and the traditional mathematics Because they are 
exact, they have been embodied in mathematics, although they belong 
just as well to a general science of relations, or general semantics, or 
'psychology’, or ‘logic’, or scientific linguistics and psjxhophysiology 
There are other mathematical disciplines, as, for instance, analysis situs, 
or the ‘algebra of logic’ , to which the above statements apply , but, for 
our present purposes, we shall limit ourselves to the former two 

Dealing with the theory of aggregates, I will give only a few defini- 
tions taken from the Encyclopaedia Bntaumca, with the purpose of 
drawing the attention of the ‘psychologists’, and others, to those psycho- 
logical data. 

The theory of aggregates underlies the theory of function An 
aggregate,, or manifold, or set, is a system such that (1) It includes all 
entities to which a certain characteristic belongs, and (2) no entity 
without this chara''teristic belongs to the system, (3) any entity of the 
system is permanently recognizable as distinct from other entities 

The separate entities which belong to such a collection, system, 
aggregate, manifold, or set are called elements We assume the possibil- 
ity of selecting at pleasure, by a definite process or law, one or more 
elements of any aggregate A, which would form another aggregate B, 
The above few lines express how the human ‘thought’ processes 
work and how languages were built up It is true that the exactness 
imposes limitations, and so the mathematical theories are not expressed 
in the usual antiquated ‘psychological’ terms, although they describe one 
of the most important psycho-logical processes 

Lately, the theory of aggiegates has led to a weighty question 
Does one of the fundamental laws of old ‘logic’ , namely, the two-valued 
law of the ‘excluded third’ (A is either B or not B), apply m all 
instances ^ Or is it i alid in some instances and invalid in others ? 

This problem is the psycho-logical kernel of the new revision of 
the foundation of mathematics, which has lately been considerably 
advanced by Professor Lukasiewicz and Tarski with their many-valued 
‘logic’, which merges ultimately with the mathematical theory of proba- 
bility , and on different grounds has perhaps been solved m the present 
non-cl, /^-system 

The notion of a group is psycho-logically still more important It is 
connected with the notions of transformation and invariance ^VIthout 
giving formal definitions unnecessary for our purpose, we may say that 



282 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


if we consider a set of elements a, b, c. , and we have a rule for combin- 
ing them, say O, and if the result of combining any two members of the 
set IS itself a member of the set, such aggregate is said to have the 
‘group property’. 

Thus, if we take numbers or colours, for instance, and the rule 
which we accept is we say that a number or a colour is transformed 
by this rule into a number or a colour, and so both possess the ‘group 
property’. Obviously, by performing the given operation, we have trans- 
formed one clement into another, yet some characteristics of our ele- 
ments have remained invariant under transformation Thus, if 1 is a 
number and 2 is a number, the operation ‘-1-’ transforms 1 into 3, since 
1 -j- 2 = 3 , but 3 has the character of being a number ; so this charac- 
teristic IS preserved or remains invariant Similarly, with colours, if we 
add colours, these arc transformed, but remain colours, and so both sets 
have the ‘group property’. Keyser suggests that the ‘mental’ processes 
have the group property, which is undoubtedly true ^ 

The role this theory plays in our language is of great importance, 
because in it we find a method of search for structure, and a method by 
which we can establish a similarity of structure between the un-speakable 
objective level and the verbal level, based on invariance of relations 
which are found or discovered m both 

The role of groups m physical theory is best described by quoting 
Professor Ramich (Remarks in brackets are mine ) ‘A physicist, we 
may take it, is a person who measures according to certain rules Let us 
denote by a the number he obtained in a given situation by applying the 
rule number one, by b the number obtained m the same situation by 
measuring according to rule number two and so on (a may be e g the 
volume, b the pressure, c the temperature of gas m a given container) . 
The physicist finds further that the results of measurements of the same 
kind undertaken m different situations satisfy certain relations, we 
may write, for instance : 

r{a,b) = c 

‘A mathematician is busy deducing from some given propositions 
other propositions, this usually leads to numbers which we may call A, 
B, C, . These numbers also satisfy certain relations, say 

R (A.B) = C 

‘Then comes, as Professor Weyl says, a messenger, a go-between 
who may be a mathematician or a physicist, or both, and says • “If you 
establish a correspondence between the physical quantities and the mathe- 
matical quantities, if you assign A to a, B to b, etc , the same relations 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 283 


hold for the physical quantities as for the corresponding mathematical 
quantities so that R = r‘' [Similarity of structure ] 

‘In the course of time new procedures of measurement are invented, 
some physical relations do not find their counterpart in the mathematical 
theory, the mathematical theory has to be patched up by introducing new 
quantities till too many quantities appear in it which do not correspond 
to physical quantities, then comes the phenomenological point of view 
and sweeps the theory out of applied mathematics — the theory becomes 
pure mathematics once more, and physicists begin to look around for a 
new theory. Everybody can find examples for this situation, it is 
enough to mention the Bohr atom which was not even mentioned today 
only fifteen years after its introduction. 

‘However the theory of groups which is being applied to physics 
IS not just one of many mathematical theories of the character described 
above , its application is of a far more fundamental nature and vve shall 
be able to indicate what it is by analj'sing further the scheme outlined 
above 

‘It may happen, and in fact it happens often, that the same mathe- 
matical theory can be applied to the same physical facts in more than one 
way , for instance, instead of assigning to the physical quantities a,b, . 
the mathematical quantities A,B, we might have assigned to them 
. . with the same results, that is, the relations for physical quan- 
tities are the same as for the mathematical quantities corresponding to 
them now (think of space considered from the experimental point of 
view — and of coordinate geometry, different ways of establishing a 
correspondence result from different choices of coordinate axes) If 
this happens it means that the mathematical theory possesses a peculiar 
property, namely, that if A' is substituted for A, B' for B and so on, no 
relation of the type R(A.B')=C which was correct before the 
substitution IS destroyed , in other words, there are substitutions or trans- 
formations for which all relations are invariant All such transforma- 
tions constitute what we call a group , the existence and the properties of 
such a group present a very important characteristic of the mathematical 
theory Moreover it is clear that if two different mathematical theories 
can be applied — in the sense described abo\e — to the same physical 
theory, the groups of these two theories will be essentially the same, so 
that the groups reflect some of the most fundamental properties of 
physical systems 

The connection between groups and structure is described by 
Professor Shaw as follows ‘The first branch of dynamic mathematics 
IS the theory of operations It includes the general theory of operators 



284 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


of any type and in particular the theory of groups of operators The 
structure of such groups is evidently a study of form It may often be 
exemplified in some concrete manner Thus the groups of geometric 
crystals exemplify the structure of thirty-two groups of a discontinuous 
character, and the 230 space-groups of the composition of crystals 
exemplify the corresponding infinite discontinuous groups The study 
of the composition series of groups, the subgroups and their relations, 
whether m the case of substitution groups, linear groups, geometric 
groups, or continuous groups, is a study of form Also, the study of the 
construction of groups, whether by generators, or by the combination of 
groups, or in other ways, is also a study of structure or form The 
calculus of operations in general, with such particular forms as differ- 
ential operators, integral operators, difference operators, distributive 
operations in general, is for the most part a study of structure In so far 
as any of these is concerned with the synthesis of compound forms from 
simple elements, it is to be classed as a study of form, as the term is 
here used ’ ^ 

In the notion of a group, we have become acquainted with two 
terms , namely, transformation and invariance The first implies ‘change’ , 
the other, a lack of ‘change’ or ‘pernicmence’ Both of these characteris- 
tics are semantically fundamental, but involve serious complexities 

The world, ourselves included, can be considered as processes which 
can be analysed in terms’ of transformed stages with all their derivative 
notions In the objective world, ‘change’ is ever present and is, perhaps, 
the most important structural characteristic of our experience But 
when a highly developed nervous sy'stem, a process itself, is acted upon 
by other processes, such nervous system discovers, at some stage of its 
development, a certain relative permanence, which, at a still later stage, is 
formulated as invariance of function and relations The latter formula- 
tion IS non-d because it can be discovered empirically, which means by 
the lower nerve centres, but also is the main necessity and means of 
operating of the higher nerve centres, so-called ‘thought’. All that we 
usually call a process of ‘association’ is nothing else than a process of 
relating, a direct consequence of the structure of the nervous system, 
where stimuli are registered m a certain four-dimensional order, which, 
on the psycho-logical level, take the form of relations From this point 
of view. It is natural that the higher nerve centres, as a limit of integrat- 
ing processes, should produce and discover invariance of relations, which 
appears then as the supreme product and so, ultimately, a necessity of 
the activity of the higher centres Obviously, if the invariance of rela- 
tions has any objective counterpart whatsoever in the external world. 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 285 


this invariance is impressed on the nervous system more than other char- 
acteristics , and so, at a certain stage, a nervous system which is capable 
of producing and using a highly developed symbolism, must discover 
and formulate this invariance 

It seems that relations, because of the possibility of discovering 
them and their invariance m both worlds, are, in a way, more ‘objective’ 
than so-called objects We may have a science of ‘invariance of rela- 
tions’, but we could not have a science of permanence of things, and the 
older doctrines of the permanence of our institutions must also be 
revised Under modern conditions, which change rather rapidly nowa- 
days, obviously, some relations between humans alter, and so the institu- 
tions must be revised If we want their iiivai lance, we must build them 
on such mvai laiit i elatwns between humans as are not altered by the 
transformations This present work, indeed, is concerned with investi- 
gating such relations, and they are found in the mechanism of time- 
binding, which, once stated, becomes quite obvious after reflection 

As Professor Shaw says ‘We find in the invariants of mathematics 
a source of objective truth So far as the creations of the mathematician 
fit the objects of nature, just so far must the inherent invariants point 
to objective reality Indeed, much of the value of mathematics m its 
applications lies m the fact that its invariants have an objective meaning 
When a geometric invariant v'anishes, it points to a very definite charac- 
ter in the corresponding class of figures When a physical invariant 
vanishes or has particular values, there must correspond to it physical 
facts When a set of equations that represent phjsical phenomena have 
a set of invariants or covariants which they admit, then the physical 
phenomena have a corresponding character, and the phjsicist is forced 
to explain the law resulting The unnoticed invariants of the elcctio- 
magnetic equations have overturned physical theories, and have threat- 
ened philosophy Consequently the importance of invariants cannot be 
too much magnified, from a practical point of view’ ■* 

It should be noticed that the non-el character of the terms relation, 
invariance , vv Inch apply both to ‘senses’ and ‘mind’, is particiilarlv impor- 
tant, as it allows us to apply them to all processes , and that such a lan- 
guage IS similar in structure not only to the world around us, but also to 
our nervous processes Thus, a process of being iron, or a rock, or a 
table, or you, or me, may be considered, for practical purposes, as a 
temporal and av'erage invariance of function on the sub-microscopic level 
Under the action of other processes, the process becomes structurally 
transformed into different relational complexes, and we die, and a table 
or rock turns into dust, and so the invariance of this function vanishes.

V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


The notion of a function involves the notion of a variable The 
functional notion has been extended to the propositional function and, 
finally, to the doctrinal function and system-function The term trans- 
formation IS closely related to that of function and relation This notion 
is based on our capacity to associate, or relate, any two or more 'mental' 
entities We can, for instance, associate a with b or b with a We say 
that we have transformed a into b, or vice versa 

An excellent example of transformation, given by Keyser, is an 
ordinary dictionary, which would be genuinely mathematical if it were 
more precise In a dictionary, eiery word is transformed into its verbal 
meaning, and vice versa A telephone directory is another example. 
Quite obviously, the term 'transformation' has far-reaching implica- 
tions If a is transformed into b, this implies that there is a relation 
between a and b which is being established, by the fact of transforma- 
tion Once a relation is established, we have a propositional function of 
two or more variables which define an extensional set of all elements 
connected by this relation ® 

We see that these three terms are inseparably united and are three 
aspects of one psycho-logical process If we have a transformation, we 
have a function and a relation, if we have a function, we have a relation 
and a transformation ; if we have a relation, we have a transformation 
and a function Transformation, as we see, is a psycho-logical term of 
action A relation has a psycho-logically mixed character. A proposi- 
tional function is a static statement, on record, with blanks for the values 
of the variables In it the form is invariant, but it may take an indefinite 
number of values The extensional manifold of the values for the vari- 
able is static, given once for all in a given context It is extensional 
and, therefore, may be empirical and experimental 

Let us take as an example, for instance, the transformation of a set 
of integers 1, 2, 3 , . Let us suppose that the given law of transformation 
IS given by the function y= 2x The result would be the manifold of 
even integers 2, 4, 6 , We see that integers are ti ansf ormed into integers ; 
therefore, the characteristic of being an integer is preserved; in other 
words, this characteristic is an invariant under the given transformation 
y = 2.r, but the values of the integers are not preserved. 

The theory of invariance is an important branch of mathematics, 
made famous of late through the work of Einstein Einstein fulfilled 
the dearest dream of Rieinann and attained the methodological and scien- 
tific ideal, that a 'law of nature' should be formulated in such a manner 
as to be invariant under groups of transformations. Such a semantic 
ideal, once stated, cannot be denied , it expresses exactly a necessity o^ 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 287 


the proper working of the human nervous .system In fact, a ‘law’ of 
nature represents nothing else than a statement of the invariance of some 
relations When the Einstein criterion is applied, it renders most of 
the old ‘natural laws’ invalid, as they cannot stand the test of invari- 
ance. The older ‘universal laws’ then appear as local private gossips, 
true for one observer and false for another 

The method of the theory of invariance gives us the trend of rela- 
tions that abide, and so expresses important psycho-logical characteristics 
of the human ‘mind’ Its further significance is revealed by Keyser m 
the suggestion that when a group of transformations leaves some speci- 
fied psycho-logical activity invariant, it defines perfectly some actual or 
potential branch of science, some actual or potential doctrine ® 

We all know how deeply rooted m us is the feeling, the longing for 
stability, how worried we are when things become unstable Worries 
and fear are destructive to semantic health and should be taken into 
account in a theory of sanity A similar semantic urge apparently 
moved mathematicians when they worked out the theory of invariance , 
It was a formulation of a necessity of the activities of the human ner- 
vous system That similar semantic methods, if applied, would give 
similar results in our daily lives, scarcely needs to be emphasized. 

We have already spoken of the mathematical theory of invariance 
as a mathematical species of a semantic theory of universal agreement 
Similarly, in a /f-system based on relations and structure, it is possible 
to formulate a theory of universal agreement which would be structur- 
ally impossible in the .<4 -system, and so the dreams of Leibnitz become 
a sober reality ; but we must first re-educate our j r. 

Section D Similarity in structure of mathematics and of our nervous 
system 

In the chapter on the Semantics of the Differential Calculus, the 
fundamental notions and method of this calculus are explained. Here 
we may say, briefly, that it consists m stratifying, or expanding into a 
series, of an interval of any sort which proceeded by large steps The 
large steps are divided into a great number of smaller and smaller steps, 
which, in the limit, when the numbers of steps become infinite, take on 
the aspect of ‘continuity’ so that we can study the ‘rate of change’ 
When ‘time’ is taken into consideration, the dynamic may be translated 
into static, and vice versa, processes can be analysed at any stage, 
This short description is far from exact or exhaustive, I emphasize 
only m an intuitive way what is of main semantic importance for our 
purpose

The main objeet of the present chapter is to explain that the struc- 
ture of the human nervous system is such that, on some levels, we 
produce dynamic abstractions , on others, static As the organism works 
ds-a-whole, for its optimum working, and, therefore, for sanity, we need 
a language, a method, which may be translated into a j r by which to 
translate the dynamic into the static, and vice versa , and such a language, 
such a method, is produced and supplied by mathematicians To some 
readers, these remarks may appear so obvious as to make it unnecessary 
to write them, but I have found, through personal observation of 
reactions of different individuals, and by a careful survey of the litera- 
ture of the subject, that even many mathematicians and physicists do 
not have this jr in all problems — or, at least, they do not know how 
to apply it. 

In Part A'^II, elementary A methods are worked out, which supply 
the neurological semantic benefits of the calculus, very easily imparted to 
even small children without auy mathematical technique, and establishing 
in them a mathematical attitude toward all language m general, training 
them in the only structural psycho-logics of sanity , namely, that of the 
calculus, which thus becomes the foundation of healthy and normal 
human j r. And this, let us repeat again, without any mathematical tech- 
nique We find, also, that there are simple and physiological means, based 
on structure, of training our s r and imparting the feel for the structural 
stratification inherent in the consciousness of abstracting. ' 

To start with, let me mention briefly a quite unexpected, unconscious, 
structural biological characteristic of mathematics; namely, its (m the 
mam) non-el, orgamsm-as-a-whole character. 

From the time of Aristotle, biologists, physiologists, neurologists, 
‘psychologists’, psychiatrists and others have spoken a great deal about the 
organism-as-a-whole , yet, they have not seemed to realize that if they 
produce el terms, they cannot apply the non-el principle. 

It will probably not be an exaggeration to say that the majority of 
mathematicians have never heard of this principle, and that, if they 
have, they paid no attention to it, yet, in practice, they have applied it 
very thoroughly The main mathematical terms are non-cl, organism-as- 
a-whole terms which apply to ‘senses’ as well as to ‘mind’. For instance, 
relation, order, difference, variable, function, transformation, invariance , 
can mostly be seen as well as ‘thought’ of. The use of such terms pre- 
vents our speculation from degenerating into purely el speculations on 
words, a process always closely related to the morbid semantic manifes- 
tations of the ‘mentally’ ill, and obviously based on the pathological 
confusion of orders of abstractions, involving inappropriate evaluation 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 289 


This fact alone is of serious importance, as it indicates that mathe- 
matics IS a language of similar structure to the structure of organisms 
and IS a correct language, not only neurologically, but also biologically. 
This characteristic of mathematics, quite unexpectedly discovered, made 
the fusion of geometry and physics possible It underlies, also, the 
theory of space-time and the Einstein theory. It will be seen later that 
It has also serious psycho-neurological importance 

It was already emphasized that the existing ‘psychologies’ are ani- 
malistic or metaphysical, because either they disregard one of the most 
unique human characteristics, such as the behaviour called mathematiz- 
mg, or they indulge in speculations on, and in, el terms It was suggested 
that no human ‘psychologist’ can actually perform his official task unless 
he is an equipped student of mathematics Unless we actually apply the 
non-el principle, and take into account that the structure of languages 
introduces implications, unconscious in the mam, and that no man is ever 
free from some doctrines and some so-called ‘logical’ processes involving 
physiological and semantic concomitants, no general theory of human 
‘psychology’ can be produced. 

The above solves a very knotty semantic problem, for we see that if 
we apply the non-el principle, anj ‘psycholog) ’ on the human level must 
become psycho-logics, though the old term ‘psychology’ could be retained 
as applying to animal researches only The very name ‘psychology’, or 
the ‘theory or science of mind’, is obviously el, and treats ‘mind’ as an 
objective separate entity As these results were originally reached inde- 
pendently, it IS interesting to notice that the modern methods and the 
application of the structural positive knowledge 1933 lead to very many 
analogies and similarities, though this, after all, might be expected 

Notice the hyphen which, out of the el and delusional objectified 
‘space’ and ‘time’, made the einsteinian space-time a language of non-el 
structure similar to the world around us . and the hyphen which out of el 
‘psychology’ makes a non-el human discipline of psycho-logics It seems 
that a little dash here and there may be of serious semantic importance 
when we deal with symbolism. 

To facilitate exposition, it is useful to stress, in the present section, 
the neurological and psychiatrical side, as an outline of the methods of 
the calculus, and related subjects will, of necessity, require separate 
treatment. 

When rats are trained to perform a simple experiment requiring 
some ‘mentality’ and afterwards a large part of the cerebral cortex is 
removed, their training may be wholly lost If such decorticated rats are 
trained again, they re-acquire the habit as readily as before It appears 
19

that, with rats, the cortex is not essential for these learning processes 
They ‘learn’ as well, or nearly as well, with their sub-cortical and thal- 
amic regions " In -what follows, to avoid misstatements, I will use the 
rather vague term, i-et sufficient for my purpose, ‘thalamic region' or 
‘lower centres’ instead of more specific terms, the use of which would 
complicate the exposition unnecessarily \\'ith dogs, apes, and men, the 
situation is increasmglj different Their nervous systems are more dif- 
ferentiated Their functional interchangeability is impaired In the most 
complex human brain there still exists some interchangeability of func- 
tion \\ hen an arm, for instance, is parah'sed through a brain-lesion, the 
arm may re-acquire a nearly normal function, though there is no regen- 
eration of the destroi ed brain tissue How ever, the interchangeability is 
less pronounced than in the lower brains There seems to be no doubt 
that the thalamic regions are not only a \estibule through which all im- 
pulses from the receptors have to pass in order to reach the cortex, but 
also that the affective characteristics are srnctly connected with processes 
in these regions It seems that some i ery primitn e and simple associa- 
tions can be earned on by the thalamic regions 

The cortex recen es its material as elaborated by the tlialamus The 
abstractions of the cortex are abstractions from abstractions and so 
ought to be called abstractions of higher order. In neurology, similarly, 
the neurons first excited are called of ‘first order' ; and the succeeding 
members of the series are called neurons of the second order , . Such 
terminolog}' is structurally similar to the inherent structure and function 
of the nervous system. The receptors are in direct contact with the out- 
side world and coniey their excitation and nene currents to the lower 
nerve centres, where these impulses are further elaborated and then 
abstracted by the higher centres 

According to our daily experience and scientific knowdedge, the out- 
side w'orld IS an ever-changing chain of events, a kind of flux, and, 
naturally, those nerve centres in closest contact with the outside world 
must react in a shifting way These reactions are easily moved one way 
or another, as in our ‘emotions’, ‘affectne moods’, ‘attention’, ‘concen- 
tration’, 'ei aluation’, and other such semantic responses In these pro- 
cesses, some associatne or relational circuits exist, and there maj be 
some very low' kind of 'thinking' on this level Birds have a well-devel- 
oped, or, perhaps, over-developed, thalamus but under-developed and 
poor cortex, w hich ma> be connected w ith their stupidity and excitability. 

Something similar could be said about the ‘thalamic thinking’ in 
humans, those individuals who ovenvork their thalamus and use their 
cortex too little are ‘emotional’ and stupid. This statement is not exag- 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 291 


gerated, because there are experimental data to show how through a 
psycho-neural training the sr, in some cases, can be re-educated, and 
that with the elimination of the semantic disturbances there is a marked 
development of poise, balance, and a proportional increase of critical 
judgement, and so ‘intelligence’ Idiots, imbeciles, and morons are usually 
‘emotional’ and excitable, as well as deficient in their ‘mental’ processes 
A similar characteristic can be found m other unclassified ‘mentally’ de- 
ficient, and their name is legfon — ^a characteristic strictly connected with, 
and often produced by, disturbances of the sr When these shifting, 
dynamic, affective, thalamic-region, lower order abstractions are ab- 
stracted again by the higher centres, these new abstractions are further 
removed from the outside world and must be somehow different 

In fact, they are different, and one of the most characteristic dif- 
ferences IS that they have lost their sJnfltiig character. These new 
abstractions aie relatively static It is true that one may be supplanted 
by another, but they do' not change In this fact lies the tremendous 
value and danger of this mechanism, as disclosed clearly by the disturb- 
ances of the j r The value is chiefly in the fact that ’such higher order 
abstractions represent a perfected kind of memory, which can be recalled 
exactly in the form as it was originally produced For instance, the 
circle, defined as the locus of points in a plane at equal distance from a 
given point called the centre, remains permanent as long as we wish to 
use this definition We can, therefore, recall it perfectly, analyse it , 
without losing the definiteness and the stability of this memor/ Thus, 
critical analysis, and, therefore, progress, becomes possible Compare this 
perfected memory, which may last indefinitely unchanged, with memories 
of ‘emotions’ which, whether dim or clear, are always distorted We see 
that the first are reliable, that the others are not 

Another most important characteristic of the higher order abstrac- 
tions IS that, although of neural origin, they may be preserved and used 
over and over again in extra-neural forms, as recorded in books and 
otherwise This fact is never fully appieciated from a neurological point 
of view. Neural products are stored up or preserved in extra-neural 
form, and they can be put back in the nenous system as active neural 
processes The above represents a fundamental mechanism of time- 
bmding which becomes overwhelmingly important, provided we discover 
the physiological mechanism of regulating the sr, on the one hand, and 
discover the mechanism by which these extra-neural factors can be made 
physiologically effective, on the other 

If humans are characterized by the fact that they build up this 
cumulative affair called ‘civilization’, this is possible through those higher

order abstractions and the time-binding ability to extend our nen-ous 
system by extra-neural means, which in the meantime, may play a most 
important neural role and become active nerious impulses The last is 
onl) possible if some abstractions are static, and so can be recorded, 
leading ultimately to further extensions of the human nen'ous system 
by extra-neural means, such as microscopes, telescopes, and practically 
all modern scientinc instruments, books, and other records 

To illustrate what has been said here, I know of no better example 
than is found m moving pictures When we watch a moving picture 
representing some life occurrence, our ‘emotions’ are aroused, ive ‘liie 
through’ the drama, hut the details, in the mam, are blurred, and a 
short time after seeing it either we forget it all or in parts, or our 
memorj' falsifies most efFectively what was seen It is easy to verify 
the abo've experimental!} by seeing one picture twice or three times, 
with an interval of a few days between each seeing The picture was 
‘moving’, all was changing, shifting, dynamic, similar to the world and 
our feelings on the un-speakable levels The impressions were vague, 
shifting, non-lastmg, and what was left of it was mostly coloured by the 
individual mood , while seeing the moving picture Naturally, under 
such conditions, there is little possibility of a rational scientific analysis 
of a situation 

But if we stop the moving film which ran, say, thirty minutes, and 
analyse the static and extensional series of small pictures on the reel, we 
find that the drama which so stirred our ‘emotions' in its moving aspect 
becomes a senes of slightly different static pictures, each difference 
betw'een the given jerk or grimace being a measurable entity, establish- 
ing relations which last indefinitely 

The moving picture represents the usuallv brief processes going on 
m the lower nerse centres, ‘close to life’, but unreliable and evading 
scrutiny The arrested static film which lasts indefinite!} , giving measur- 
able differences between the recorded jerks and grimaces, obsiously 
allows anal} sis and gives a good analogy of the working of higher nerve 
centres, disclosing also that all life occurrences have many aspects, the 
selection of w hich is mostl} a problem of our pleasure and of the selec- 
tion of language The moving picture gives us the process, each static 
film of the reel gives us stages of the process in chosen intervals In 
case we want a moving picture of a growing plant, for instance, we 
photograph it at gi\ en intervals and then run it in a moving-picture pro- 
jector, and then we see the process of growth. These are empirical 
facts, and the calculus supplies us with a language of similar structure 
with many other important consequences.

It IS characteristic that those who claim to be most mteiested in 
human affairs and human processes, whom .we call, among others, 
‘philosophers’, ‘psj chologists’. , should not have disco\ered much of value 
in these fields But mathematicians, who disclaim meaning in their un- 
defined terms, or ‘truth’ in their postulates, or interest in human affairs, 
have had a most astonishing and unique success by elaborating methods 
for the translation of the dynamic into static and the static into dynamic 
Claims and disclaims matter little, but working in accordance uith the 
survival order of the nerve structure and currents has produced most 
\aluable results 

The different methods of mathematics and the four-dimensional 
‘world’ of ^Minkowski form the means for tianslating the dynamic into 
static and vice versa ilinkowski established a language of a new struc- 
ture, closer to actual facts of the uorld around us and ourselves, 
making the general theory of Einstein possible Further analj sis of these 
issues is carried out in Part IX. and it is one of the semantic founda- 
tions upon which a positn e theor}' of sanity can be built 

Disclaiming definite meanings, mathematicians have an intuitive 
predilection for selecting their terms and pursuing their line of enquiry 
among possible meanings, although formally these meanings are disre- 
garded The feeling which diiects the selection of material which is 
formally interesting and important is akin to the artistic sense, but, 
unfortunately, in spite of its importance, it has been neglected by 
‘psychologists’ Quite often it is the ‘feel’ which directs the mathema- 
ticians in their researches and suggests or modifies lines of development 
or the selection of one set of postulates in preference to other sets This 
is why the ordinary sense of the terms used in mathematics is so im- 
portant, although It represents only some of the possible meanings 
These, with their implications, usually represent most important struc- 
tural characteristics of the human nervous system and the world 

This is to be expected because of the reasons given above , the more 
so that invariance in this shifting world is a characteristic of relations, 
and mathematics is a language of exact relations which, in the mean- 
time, have mostly objeclne counterparts The highest abstractions at 
every date are detached from the outside world neurologically, and 
should remain detached, to represent ‘pure mind’ in action These higher 
abstractions are on the public level, as they are transmittable verbally 
with all characteristics included They are static, unhampered directly 
by the outside events, although they normally originate in them These 
higher order abstractions are ‘digested’ and translated into lower order 
abstractions and returned to the lower centres, and they receive their 



294 


V MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


meanings close to life Such meanings are enlightened meanings, a sur- 
vival process, and each nervous level did its work properly 

We know that a number of human races have perished without 
leaving many traces of their existence. This process is going on con- 
tinually, even now Some races are progressing . some are regressing , 
some are at a seeming standstill It would appear that the mechanism 
of higher order abstractions had and has survival value, and, therefore, 
should not be neglected but cultivated In this special case, cultivation 
IS a condition inherent m the process and a necessity for time-binders 
Serious semantic dangers are also revealed by analysis and verified 
by observation These higher order abstractions, let us repeat, are static 
and may last indefinitely, as long as for structural reasons we do not 
replace the old by new ones Even then, though rejected, they remain 
as a permanent fact on record Obviously, these higher abstractions 
have only a ‘second-hand’ connection with the outside world Even their 
character is changed, they are static while the world is dynamic The 
lower ‘sense’ world has ‘characteristics left out’, owing to the mechanism 
of abstracting of the lower centres , and the abstractions of higher orders 
have ‘all characteristics included’, because these are abstractions from 
abstractions, an nitra-organisinal process m its entirety, their starting 
material being already an end-product of the activities of the lower 
centres This mechanism is only under full control if we are conscious 
of abstracting, because the higher order abstractions m the nervous 
chain affect, in their turn, the lower centres, and, m pathological cases, 
impress on them a semantic delusional or illusional evaluation as if a 
character of experience In severe cases, eren the lower nerve centres 
are stimulated to such an extent that hallucinations appear 

If we do not know how to handle different order abstractions, this 
results in serious semantic dangers If the distribution of the returning 
nerve currents is a non-survival one, we exhibit semantic disturbances, 
such as identification or confusion of orders of abstractions, delusions, 
illusions, and hallucinations Thus, we ascribe to the products of the 
lower nerve centres, the lower order abstractions, characteristics fic- 
titious and impossible for them, such as ‘immutability’, ‘permanence’, 
involving disorientation about ‘time’ , , which are characteristics of the 
higher order abstractions, but do not belong to the world as given by 
the lower abstractions, and result in an improper evaluation disturbing 
to the sr Such disturbances make us, naturally, absolutists and dog- 
matists, involve serious affective disturbances, and lead to non-adaptive 
behaviour and reactions, and other semantic manifestations of un-sanity 
These, in their turn, make adjustment more difficult, often affecting the 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 295 


structure of man-made institutions, which again make adjustments more 
complex and often impossible. We become un-sane, ‘insane’, and life, 
whether public or private, becomes a mess In such a vicious semantic 
circle, we distort our education, our systems, and institutions Often the 
morbid reactions of powerful individuals are forced upon masses, who 
are then ruled by these morbid products, w'lth injury to their nervous 
systems Different mass hysterias, ‘revivals’, wars, political and religious 
propaganda, very often commercial advertisements, offer notable 
examples. 

The morbid semantic influence of commercialism has not been 
investigated, but it does not take much imagination to see that com- 
mercial psycho-logics, as exemplified by the theories of commercial 
evaluation, ‘w'lsdom’, appeal to selfishness, animal cunning, concealing of 
true facts, appeal to ‘sense’ gratification , produce a verbal and semantic 
environment and slogans for the children which, if preserved in the 
grown-ups, must produce some pathological results It is hoped that 
some day a psychiatrist will investigate this large, neglected, and very 
important semantic problem 

The lack of structural linguistic researches and investigation of our 
sr, and the ignorance of those who rule, make us nearly helpless 
Malaria or other germ diseases would never be eliminated were we to 
preserve religiously the sources of infection The semantic sources of 
un-sanity are not only defended hut are actively sponsored by organized 
Ignorance and the power of merchants, state, and church 

The situation is acute If we could entirely eliminate our cortex, it 
would, perhaps, not be so serious We could, peihaps, live as complex 
a life as a fish and have a nervous system perfectly adjusted to such a 
life But, unfortunately, with a structural change, or, according to 
Lashley, with the change even in the total mass of the brain, the activi- 
ties and the role of the whole, including other parts, are profoundly 
altered ® These become inadequate, as shown by the boy born wuthout 
the cortex, already described. His nervous system was much more com- 
plex than that of fishes or of some lower animals which lead adequately 
a rather complex life But the boy was less equipped for life than they. 
Even his ‘senses’, though apparently ‘normal’ on macroscopic levels, 
must have been pathological on colloidal and sub-microscopic levels and 
did not function properly. We know, also, that in many cases of ‘mental’ 
ills the ‘sense reactions’ are abnormal, sometimes the patients seem to 
be entirely insensitive to stimuli which would produce most acute pain 
to other less pathological individuals 



296 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


It IS impossible to eliminate completely from our lives or nerve 
currents the higher abstractions and their psycho-neural effect Curi- 
ously enough, this elementary fact has never been emphasized or taken 
into account seriously , j et it is a crucial semantic factor in our attitude 
toward science and our future Those who attempt such elimination, 
whether by actively peisecuting science, or by emitting propaganda 
against science, or by the cynical or ignoring attitude toward ‘mental’ 
achievements, whether personally, or ui education, or in public prints, 
or other public activities, do not succeed in eliminating the higher order 
abstractions, but simply introduce pathological semantic reactions and 
succeed in disorganizing their own nervous systems and those of others 
I mtended this implication uhen I said that our existing educational , 
systems produce morons, but ‘geniuses’ are born Such very general 
semantic directives are, perhaps, responsible for the extremely low level 
of our non-technical development Humans are not to be judged simply 
by the ability to drive an automobile or by the knowledge of how to use 
a bathtub , nor yet by their capacity for buying and selling things pro- 
duced by others. 

The tendency of some public prints to appeal to the morbidity of 
mob psycho-logics and to its ignorance, insisting that all that is said 
should be said in ‘one-syllable’ words, so that the mob can understand, 
in a human class of life, is an ai resting or regressive tendency. What 
should be urged for sanity, and for humans, is that the mob should also 
learn the use of at least two-syllable words! Then, perhaps, the day 
would come when they could follow easily and habitually the use of 
non-el terms and, perhaps, even of words connected by a hyphen 

This appeal to mob psycho-logics and ignorance affects profoundly 
our s r and should be investigated. It definitely appears that in countries 
where the majority reads only the sort of publications referred to above 
and commercial advertisements, their psycho-logical equipment and 
standards are lower than those of perfectly illiterate peasants of other 
countries It is not fully realized that in a symbolic class of life, sym- 
bolism of any sort — e g , public prints — splays an environmental role and 
creates sr which may be distinctly morbid The problems of public 
prints, commercialism , and their psycho-logical effect on the s r should 
undergo a searching analysis by psychiatrists, and definite suggestions 
should be formulated by psychiatric scientific organizations or congresses 

Under the conditions prevailing at present, it is futile to preach 
‘morals’ of any metaphjsical kind They have never worked satisfac- 
torily, and increasingly they cannot work, particularly under the present 
much more complex conditions of life They disorganize the survival 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 297 


ELtivities and processes of the human nervous system. The imposed and 
delusional dogmas are themselves the result of pathological evaluation 
in their originators, a necessit}', perhaps, on a primitive level, but pro- 
foundly semantically harmful under the complexities of hfe-conditions 
1933. 

As it IS impossible to eliminate the influence of the higher order 
abstractions, we should investigate whether or not we can control these 
processes and the related s r We can learn to regulate these processes, 
which otherwise may become pathological, and to redirect the currents 
into constructive survival channels I can state definitely that this is pos- 
sible We can control physiologically the sr through the elimination of 
identification, by training in order, in consciousness of abstracting, and 
similar disciplines, and thus eliminate the pathological semantic disturb- 
ances of confusion of orders of abstractions Such training, whenever 
possible, has seemingly a beneficial influence even on the more extreme 
pathological states listed abo\ e, and suggests general preventive value 

Let me briefly restate the fundamental differences between lower 
order abstractions and higher The lower order abstractions are manu- 
factured by the lower nerve centres, which are closer to, and in direct 
contact with, actual life experiences These are non-permanent, shifting, 
vague and un-speakable, but often very intense They play a most im- 
portant role in our daily lives They cannot be transmitted, as they are 
essentially of a non-transmittable character, and have a private, non- 
public character All ‘sense’ impressions, ‘feelings’, ‘moods’ , are repre- 
sentative of them We should remember that, detached, they are 
fictions, manufactured verbally, because our language happens to be 
el Actually, these lower centres are in the cyclic chain and so influence, 
and are influenced by, the full cycle, including the higher order abstrac- 
tions, whatever the latter may be in a given individual The mam point 
IS that they are shifting, changing, non-permanent, non-stable — ‘moving’, 
so to say — and remain un-speakable 

The higher order abstractions are abstractions from the lower 
order abstractions, being further removed from the outside world, and 
are of a distinctly different character. These are static, ‘permanent’, and 
cannot be entirely eliminated from any one 

From the point of view of sanity, the problem of how we can 
handle these functions becomes paramount In the cyclic nervous chain, 
we always must translate one lev'el into the other Obviously, if, in the 
higher centres, we elaborate shifting, changing, non-permanent material, 
this material is not appropriate for them , they cannot work properly, and 
some pathological processes may set in 



298 


V. MATHEMATICS A A LANGUAGE 


If we elaborate in the lovaer nerve centres abstractions that are 
static, permanent , in character, and hence inappropriate for the lower 
centres, we build up morbid non-survival identifications, delusions, illu- 
sions, hallucinations, and other disturbances of evaluation, resulting in 
milder cases in absolutism, dogmatism, fanaticism , and, in heavier cases, 
111 a neurosis or even a psychosis. 

It seems quite obvious that each nervous level has its own specific 
kind of material to deal with As they are in a cyclic nervous chain 
and are interconnected m a bewilderingly complex way, the problem 
of appropriate translation of one level of abstractions into the other 
becomes a semantic foundation for a well-balanced functioning of the 
nervous system In this respect, we differ fundamentally from animals 
The above difficulties do not arise in animals to that extent, because their 
nervous systems are not differentiated enough for such sharp differen- 
tiation in the functioning For this reason, without human interference, 
there could be no ‘insane’ animals which could survive (see Part VI) 
But, having no static higher order abstractions in the human sense, they 
cannot pass on their ‘experiences’, which are transmittable only in the 
higher order formulations m neural and extra-neural forms to the next 
generations Animals are not time-binders 

For humans, the proper translation of dynamic into static and static 
into dynamic becomes paramount for sanity, on psycho-logical levels, 
affecting, probably by colloidal processes, the psycho-neural foundation 
of semantic responses 

Psychiatry informs us that most of the ‘mentally’ ill have their mam 
disturbances in the dynamic affective field It is a very difficult field to 
reach by the older methods, the more so that the older el sharp distinc- 
tion between ‘intellect’ and ‘emotions’ prevented the discovery of work- 
able means ‘Thinking’ and ‘feeling’ are not to be divided so simply 
We know how ‘thinking’ is influenced by ‘feeling’ , but we know very 
little how ‘feeling’ is influenced by ‘thinking’ — ^perhaps, because we have 
not analysed the .semantic issues in non-el terms 

All psychotherapy, with its manifold theories, each contributing its 
share, is a semantic attempt to influence ‘feeling’ by ‘thinking’ A large 
number of successful cases seems to show clearly that some such means 
are possible Large numbers of failures show equally that the methods 
used are not structurally satisfactory The need of more scientific inves- 
tigations of a more general and fundamental, non-el character becomes 
emphatic The present enquiry shows that such structural investigations 
suggest that the method can be found in the psycho-logics of the ‘mind’ 
at Its best; namely, m mathematics, which unexpectedly leads to a 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 299 


physiological control of the s r, effective not only as a therapeutic, but 
also as a preventive, educational means 

Identification as a factor of un-sanity seems to be a' natural conse- 
quence of the evolution from ‘animal’ to ‘man’, particularly at our pres- 
ent stage, while the human race is so recent a product The human 
cortex appeared only comparatively lately and is a young structure ; 
the thalamic regions have a much longer history of functioning It 
seems natural that the nervous impulses should pass the shorter, more 
phylogenetically travelled, paths in preference to comparatively newer 
and longer paths, a principle well known in neurology in connection with 
so-called ‘Bahnung’ If education, and on human levels any kind of 
adjustment involving s r involves some education, fails to force the nerve 
currents into their proper channels, or actnely establishes in them 
semantic ps 3 'cho-neural blockages through pathological evaluation ac- 
quired because of faulty training, we should expect either infantilism 
or regression to still lower levels Whatever the correct explanation of 
the distribution of nerve currents, semantic blockages , may be, observa- 
tion shows unmistakably that some such assumptions are necessitated by 
observed manifestations in behaviour Ehcpenments show, also, that such 
defects can be helped greatly by the proper re-training and re-education 
of the s r. 

To understand the structure of these semantic disturbances, we 
must become acquainted with the affective components which underlie 
mathematics and mathematical methods, hitherto disregarded, because 
of the el character of our old terminology There is another striking 
connection In severe ‘mental’ illnesses, we usually find a disorientation 
in ‘space’ and ‘time’, which are, by necessity, relational data of experi- 
ence In the semantic disturbances called identification, we also find, as 
a rule, relational disorientation about ‘space’ and ‘time’, more subtle but 
very vicious m effect, bordering on what are called ‘philosophical’ prob- 
lems. which, as a matter of fact, represent psycho-neural disturbances 
Since Einstein, the disturbances can be easily eliminated, provided we 
take into account structural non-el issues m connection with j r and a 
/^-system 

It IS instructive to make a short survey of the methods by which 
the mechanism of the nervous C}xle — ‘senses’, ‘feelings’ , first, ‘mind’, 
which again influences the ‘feelings’, next — works in mathematics 
Weierstrass, the famous mathematician, says, m one of his writings, 
that a mathematician is a kind of poet This is largely true Mathe- 
matics IS not only a rigorous linguistic lelational pattern, but it uses 
the highest abstractions which we have reached at a given period from

the data given by the lower nerve centres, which are closer to experience, 
or rather which constitute experience The older arguments about the 
connection or lack of connection between the lower order abstractions 
(‘sense' data ,) , and mathematics are due solely to a confusion of orders 
of abstractions and are a useless gambling in el terms Only m severe 
‘mental’ ills is the speech of the patients entirely unconnected with first 
order external ‘realities’, and so the study of relations of many kinds 
and orders, called ‘mathematics’, cannot, as long as it is sane, be entirely 
detached from ‘reality’. In fact, it is useless for mathematicians to try 
to produce disciplines which have no practical applications As long 
as it IS professionally accepted as mathematics, and, therefore, a science 
and sane, whatever mathematicians produce will always be connected 
with lower order abstractions, and must have an application sooner or 
later When these higher order abstractions, produced very often by 
many individuals, are absorbed and returned m a modified form to the 
low er centres as ‘visualization’, ‘intuition’, ‘feelings’ , the given individual 
is closer to the external world than he was before, because he has 
absorbed, digested, and appropriated the nerrous results of many more 
experiences than he himself could have gathered alone He is able to 
compare, evaluate, and relate, revise and adjust his private experiences 
and observations with the translated experiences from higher abstrac- 
tions of many more individuals The ti anslatwn is indispensable, because 
the reactions of both levels are entirely different, and comparable only 
when they are on one level Creative work has begun 

Experiences given by the lower centres and lower abstractions are 
full of meanings, colouring, affective and semantic components, and 
these are not directly comparable with the higher abstractions produced 
by the higher nerve centres They must be first transformed, 'digested', 
and translated into terms of the lower centres, which are the only ones 
w'hich are effective on the lower levels We call them ‘visualization’, 
‘intuition’, ‘feeling’, ‘cultuie’. The exact mechanism is not well known, 
but we have a number of data which show that the low'er nerve centres 
are somehow engaged in these processes 

When this is accomplished, the mathematician has at his disposal 
an enormous amount of data , first, his personal experiences and observa- 
tion of actual life (low^er centres and lower order abstractions), and also 
all the personal experiences and observations of past generations. Al- 
though the latter were stored in the form of higher order abstractions 
only as an account of past experiences in neural or extra-neural forms, 
his nervous cycle was affected by them, and they were translated back 
into experiences of the lower levels 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 301 


With such an enoiniuus amount of data of experience, he can 
re-evaluate the data, ‘see’ them anew, and so produce new and more 
useful and structurally more correct higher order abstractions In their 
turn, these will produce similar semantic effects with other indi\ iduals , 
The mechanism is, after all, well known and general, obvious even in 
the relations between some feeble-minded parents and their eventually 
feeble-minded children. It is entirely obvious on racial grounds , but, at 
present, it is not so obvious, and often but slightly effective, on personal 
and individual grounds, because we have had no means of training 
structurally and effectn ely the j rin proper evaluation The mechanism 
IS entirely general, but it is obvious and seen at work in the majority of 
creative scientists and so-called ‘geniuses’ These processes have not been 
analysed in terms of order, and so, although we use them often, we are 
not conscious of their mechanism and have no means of training our j r. 
The sr are a product of tiaining, education , and are not inborn in a 
given form Even birds bred in a laboratory which have never heard 
their parents or other birds sing will sing, as this is an inborn reflex, 
but the melody produced is diff erent from that of their parents Under 
normal conditions, the form of the song is standardized and is a result 
of copying parents In other words, the melody-environment has affected 
them With humans, it is not only a question of the given noises, the 
‘melody-environment’ which we relate with some experiences, but the 
sr involve affective responses to meanings, and this depends on the 
structure of language, involving unconscious, yet vital, evaluation factors 
and our attitude toward language, which ultimately depends on our 
knowledge of the mechanism and use of language 

These problems are extremely complex and subtle, and, at this 
stage, we are not ready to go into further details, the more so that there 
IS a very simple and effective physiological structural method given in 
Part VH, which in practice eliminates enormous theoretical difficulties. 
There is little doubt that this mechanism of recasting, or translation of 
abstractions, is present in all of us, but this mechanism requires knowl- 
edge of the proper way to handle it, and that knowledge is not inborn, 
but has to be acquired by education. Up to the present date, these 
problems have been disregarded, and the j r treated in a haphazard way ; 
once the physiological mechanism of these reactions is discovered, how- 
ever, we shall be able to use its benefits without the inherent dangers of 
disturbances 

Here we must face a rather unexpected fact 

Mathematics is alone and unique in that it has no content or definite 
meanings ascribed to the undefined terms , and, therefore, only in mathe-

matics can we avoid the vicious influencing of lower centres through the 
feeling of false analogies which distort and disorganize the process 
It IS important to notice that the main and only lasting advances in 
‘philosophy’ have been made by mathematicians, and, as a rule, when- 
ever a trained mathematician attempts to work at any other profession 
not requiring mathematics, he shortly becomes an outstanding worker 
in the new field It must be obvious that the returning nerve currents, 
when they produce the ‘feel’ (language of the lower centres) of physics, 
or chemistry, or biology, or other sciences with a definite content, must 
have a most pronounced semantic effect Because of this physical con- 
tent, identification and other semantic disturbances are usually present, 
instead of the highly beneficial visualization 

Empirically, this is quite obviously true Let us survey the character 
of this process in physicists and chemists Their problems, the content 
of their abstractions, are obviously not so closely related to human lives 
as the problems of biology History shows that the attitude (affective) 
of those scientists toward human affairs is often shallow, but very sel- 
dom VICIOUS or harmful But let us take the attitudes of biologists, 
whose subject is seemingly much closer, or, at least, more affectively 
related to our problems, and we see, from Aristotle on, the brutalizing 
and imsaentific (1933) effect of the false biological analogies Prac- 
tically all the VICIOUS, unjustified, and unscientific generalizations which 
have made the white race the most animalistic, selfish, cruel, hypocritical, 
and un-sane race on earth are mainly due to the biological. A, distorted 
reasonings and j r produced by false analogy. 

In all this ‘philosophy’, they always reasoned from pigs, cats, and 
dogs to man Since they were ‘scientific’, we blindly assumed that they 
must know what they were talking about Even today, the majority of 
the older biologists refuse to investigate the structure of their language. 
They do not seem to be able to realize that most biological ‘philosophies’ 
are structurally fallacious and unscientific m 1933 They still uncon- 
sciously follow Aristotle They refuse to understand that life is made up 
of absolute and unique individuals, and that ‘man’ or ‘animal’ is not an 
object, but labels verbal fictions. 

In actual life, the differences between individuals are absolute, and 
father and son are different These are the empirical facts of their 
sciences the rest being verbal fictions The notorious Tennessee trial 
demonstrated that in a large country like the United States of America, 
with a few good universities, there was no biologist to voice these points 
about ‘evolution’ It is true that, through the work of neurologists and 
some others, biologists, of late, are beginning to see that they cannot 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 303 


gerieralue in the way they have done for more than two thousand years 
Naturally, there are notable exceptions, yet even these do not realize 
the structural linguistic and semantic issues involved. 

I most emphatically do not deny that animal researches are extremely 
useful and necessary, but I question the right of biologists lo remain 
innocent of the importance of hngmstic and semantic issues, and to 
indulge in vicious, unwarranted generalizations which, although they may 
express their own metaphysics and sr, should not be advanced as ‘scien- 
tific’ results Biologists ought to be informed enough to understand that 
‘man’ and ‘animal’ are verbal fictions, and labels for something going on 
inside our skins — ^not labels for the unique individuals with which they 
have to deal outside their skins 

An example may, perhaps, be useful. We know that rats, prairie 
dogs, and some other animals are mostly immune to scurvy, but that 
man, monkeys, and guinea pigs are mostly not immune How can we 
generalize from a rat to a man or a guinea pig^ Or how much can we 
learn about the behaviour of a bee from the behaviour of an oyster, to 
use the example of Professor Jennings? Even m ‘man’, what helps one 
‘man’, kills another 

Similar false analogies occur m the A classification of ‘man’ as an 
‘animal’ This classification disregards completely the j r and twists the 
generally accepted folk-meaning of the term ‘animal’ into a special mean- 
ing which introduces very vicious semantic implications If we classify 
‘man’ as an ‘animal’, the structural A ‘plus’ elementahsm is automatically 
introduced, since ‘man’, obviously, has many characteristics of behaviour 
not shown by the ‘animal’, taken in its folk-meaning The disregard of 
the folk-meaning in our terminology shows cleaily the complete dis- 
regard for sr w'hich are very strongly i elated to those folk-meanings 
If we are to call ‘man’ an ‘animal’, then ‘man’ must be an ‘animal’ ‘plus’ 
something If we were to call him some sort of a junior ‘god’, he w'ould 
be a ‘god’ ‘minus’ something The latter structural fallacy w'ould be 
just as VICIOUS m its implications, and would again deliver our specula- 
tions into the semantic clutches of the structure of a primitive-madc el 
language 

Similar objections could be raised to that class of ‘biological 
psychologies’ exemplified by the ‘behaviourists’ — (not to be confused 
with the illuminating and highly constructive biological psychiatry or 
psychobiology introduced by Professor Adolf Meyer) ” The ‘behav- 
iourists’ try to be ultra-‘scientific’, not realizing that their knowledge 
of scientific method and structure belongs somewhere to the sixteenth 
century

Creative mathematicians, after becoming acquainted with the work 
of their predecessors and contemporaries, achieve their own results, at 
first, through ‘intuition’, ‘feeling’. They ‘visualize’ the most abstract 
theories, though sometimes it takes the invention of new means to 
achieve this result Their lower nervous centres are affected by the 
higher abstractions made by themselves and others. This process ac- 
counts for the fact that no mathematical achievement is ever detached, 
or possibly can be detached, from life The source of all creative work 
is always in the lower centres, which are in more direct contact with the 
world around us, through ‘feelings’, ‘intuitions’, ‘visualization’, and 
other first order reactions 

Mathematics and what is called ‘sublimation’ in psychiatry have a 
similar neural mechanism, which is expressed structurally in the spiral 
theory, or in the cyclic chain of nerve currents, where the end-product 
of one process becomes the starting point of the next As was said 
before, this is quite obvious on racial grounds, but more difficult to dis- 
cover or apply m individual experience, if we disregard structure and 
non-el s r. 

If we can, let us discover means by which the ‘feel’ of modern 
science can be imparted without falsification and technicalities, which, 
perhaps, may be only auxiliary means to get the more fundamental life 
results We may at once anticipate the means which we shall discover. 
The key problem is to eliminate, first, the semantic disturbance called 
identification or the confusion of orders of abstractions, and similar dis- 
turbances of evaluation This elimination is attained physiologically 
through the development of the consciousness of abstracting, which leads 
to proper evaluation, visualization without semantic disturbances In 
other words, we must find means by which higher abstractions can be 
translated physiologically into lower abstractions, uniquely connected 
with the translation of the dynamic into the static and vice versa 

The present status of the white race — I do not know enough about 
the structures of languages of other races and their j r to speak about 
them — IS such that a majority of our self-imposed difficulties is due to 
the lack of scientific structural analysis, which lack makes it impossible 
to control or regulate physiologically and adequately the semantic evalu- 
ation through education Under such conditions, everything based on 
arguments involving the ‘is’ of identity and the older el ‘logic’ and ‘psy- 
chology’, such as the prevailing doctrines, laws, institutions, systems , 
cannot possibly be in full accordance with the structure of our nervous 
system This, in turn, affects the latter and results in the prevailing 
private and public un-samty Hence, the unrest, unhappiness, nervous

strain, irritability, lack of wisdom and absence of balance, the instability 
of our institutions, the wars and revolutions, the increase of ‘mental’ 
ills, prostitution, criminality, commercialism as a creed, the inadequate 
standards of education, the low professional standards of lawyers, 
priests, politicians, physicians, teachers, parents, and even of scientists 
— which in the last-named field often lead to dogmatic and antisocial 
attitudes and lack of creativeness. 

This is, naturally, an unsatisfactory semantic state of aflfairs, and, 
in consequence, our nervous systems do not function properly, according 
to the potentialities of proper evaluation inherent in their structure 
False creeds or doctrines underlying the s r, particularly when connected 
with strong affective tension, play as great a havoc with our responses 
and capacities on sub-microscopic colloidal levels as any macroscopic 
organic lesion of our nervous system. If our s r are pathological, invari- 
ably some affective disturbance, and psycho-neural blockages on the 
colloidal level, must be present. The nervous currents are then deviated 
and forced into lower, non-survival-for-man channels, resulting in 
various forms of arrested development or regressive symptoms Through 
this we are deprived of the higher {human) ‘intelligence’, which is the 
result of the optimum working of the nervous system on all levels, 
we become ‘mentally’ deficient in various aspects and degrees, and we 
have to copy animals, primitives, and infants, and so present, in milder 
disturbances, the pathetic picture — so often seen — of adult infantilism, 
or display other regressive manifestations Thousands of such cases 
have been analysed and recorded in psychiatrical literature The mechan- 
ism of these disturbances is quite clear, because, after the re education 
of the jr, if this is at all successful, the psycho-neurological colloidal 
blockage is eliminated, and the patient is relieved from his semantic 
afflictions. 

Instances of infantilism and animalistic reactions are abundant 
everywhere , but as this problem is analysed further in Part VII, here 
we shall not pursue the matter further. 

It should be noticed, however, in this connection, that sex abnor- 
malities of every description and most sex disturbances are also inter- 
connected with infantilism in adults In public life and activities, the 
results are equally pathetic. Instead of analysing and foreseeing, we 
proceed by trial and error, as animals do, a wasteful and painful method 
The possession of an adequate physiological method for the translation 
from the appropriate reactions of one level to that of another, therefore, 
becomes paramount The non-el language and the methods of mathe- 
matics appear, then, to be of neurological value The terms are easily

and correctly applied to both levels, and thus facilitate passing from the 
language appropriate to one level to the language appropriate to the 
other. But, in this case, to avoid confusion, we should have to make 
clear the multi ordinality of terms and to embody recognition of this 
multiordinality in every, even the most elemental^', education, as any 
education shapes and moulds some sr This will aid the working of the 
human ners'ous system, which, at present, is blocked, sometimes very 
effectively, by disturbances of evaluation The old el, subject-predicate 
language has a structure dissimilar to the structure of this world as we 
know it in 1933, and also dissimilar to the structure and function of the 
human ner\ ous system, and so by necessity, hampers the s.r and denates 
them from their natural course 

That the problems before us are subtle, and that the demarcation 
line between 'sanity', ‘un-sanity’. and ‘insanitj,’’ is extremely thin, is no 
reason for neglecting this neurological benefit of psj'chophysiological 
investigation It seems obvious that the attitude toward our forms of 
representation, and toward our sr, are fundamentally affected b}' the 
disturbances of evaluation called identification or confusion of orders 
of abstractions, and, in particular, by objectification, which ascribe un- 
justified and delusional values and meanings to these forms 

Up to this point, we have been emphasizing the beneficial structural 
aspect of madiematics, and it is now necessary to explain why mathe- 
matizing, when considered as a formal interplay of contentless symbols, 
should not be considered a high-class 'mental' actmty, no matter how 
useful and important it may be, and why the majority of mathematicians 
do not get the full psycho-logical semantic benefit of their training and 
activities The nervous systems of many such mathematicians do not act 
fully and successfully, nor pass normally through the cycle of their 
natural activities Such a technician is seldom, if ever, what we call a 
great man He seldom has a direct creative influence on our lives But, 
in the case of a man with a more efficient nervous system, the cycle is 
completed successfully, the higher abstractions are translated back into 
new lower abstractions, which are closer to life Such an individual 
‘sees’, ‘visualizes’, has 'intuitions’ , m his sjmbolic interplays He then 
has a new structural v ision through a new surv ey of his own experiences 
and all the experiences of others when translated in terms of lower 
centres. He gams a deeper insight, which he ultimately makes useful 
to all of us 

Immediate experience, always un-speakable, is strictly connected 
with the lower centres In the translation of experience into higher 
order abstractions and language, the un-speakable character of experi- 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 307 


ence is lost, and a new neurological process is needed to re-Liaiiskte these 
higher order abstractions into new lower abstractions, and thus fully 
and successfully to complete the nervous cycle One can learn to play 
with symbols according to rules, but such play has little creative value 
If the translation is made into the language of lower centres — namely, 
into ‘intuitions’, ‘feelings’, ‘visualizations’ , — the higher abstractions gain 
the character of experience, and so creative activity begins Individuals 
with thoroughly efficient nervous systems become what we call ‘geniuses’ 
They create new values by inventions of new methods and m other ways, 
which give us a new structural means of exploring, and thus of dealing 
with, the world around us and ourselves, and so, ultimately, human 
adjustment is helped 

It IS important for the reader to become thoroughly familiar with 
the simple division of our nervous processes into terms of order in a 
cyclic chain Even neurology calls the neurons excited first of ‘first 
order’, and the succeeding members of the series, of ‘second order’. 
The above considerations have an important practical semantic bearing 
for all of us, since many of the processes which we are describing can 
be influenced educationally by simple methods, because the term ‘order’, 
when applied, acquires a physiological character for evaluaiton The 
description and verbal analysis of the process is, naturally, complex, but 
once the physiological base of evaluation is discovered, the training 
becomes very simple, although not easy 

The principal aim of this present work is to make available a simple 
and practical physiological means for accomplishing what is highly 
desirable, and, at the same time, for eliminating rvhat is semantically 
undesirable. We deal with mathematics, because mathematics is unique, 
and, being unique, has no substitute When discussing the theory of 
meanings, we have shown that all verbalism is, ultimately, similar to 
mathematics in structure This conclusion contradicts many current 
theories of language and meanings, and so, at this stage of our argument, 
we lay special emphasis on the only discipline m which these issues are 
clear and obvious, namely, mathematics The older theories, based on 
Ignorance of mathematics, have led to serious abuses of our linguistic 
capacities and to sr which are mostly pathological, with the result that 
practically 99 per cent of us are semantically disturbed and un-sane 
Many of us, even, are on the verge of more serious ‘mental’ illnesses 

It will be well to give a rough picture of the similarities of, and 
differences between, the working of the human ‘mind’ at its worst 
(‘insanity’), and its working at its best (mathematics) We shall find 
that the average man is between the two, often dangerously close to the

first The following picture is rough and one-sided, but suggestive, and 
should be w orked out more fully 

The ‘insane’ have structural, conscious or unconscious, ‘premises’, 
which are ‘false’, or, in general, semantically inappropriate Their j r 
are shifting when they should be static, or static when they should be 
flexible In the mam, the difficulty of evaluation lies m the lower 
abstractions and the affective field These abstractions are not properly 
transmitted or translated or regulated by the higher centres ; or else, the 
higher order static abstractions are projected with too strong affective 
components on the lower centres Hence, different identifications, delu- 
sions, illusions, and hallucinations result Their ‘ideas’ are evaluated as 
things or experience, and affectively objectified m different degrees, 
which results m the above mis-evaluatmg manifestations These seman- 
tic disturbances and tensions make the ‘mentally’ ill believe irresistibly 
m the ‘truth’ of their ‘premises’ and their inductions and deductions, 
which they follow blindly In them, as m the rest of us, some internal 
affective pressure comes first, but because m humans the effect of higher 
nerve centres cannot be entirely abolished, this affective pressure is 
rationalized somehow into some sort of ‘premises’ This organism-as-a- 
whole process is entirely general and applies to all of us in all our 
activities, but is most clearly seen in the ordered details m the work of 
creatu e scientists and ‘geniuses’, and m the more severe cases of ‘mental’ 
illness To the ‘mentally’ ill these ‘premises’ haie the value of ‘the’ and 
not ‘a’ premise They act upon them, and so cannot adjust themselves 
to a world different from their fancies They would seldom survive at 
all if left alone by themselves, particularly m a complex ‘civilization’ 

Mathematicians, also, have structural premises, often called pos- 
tulates, but they never evaluate them to be ‘true’ , w'herefore their prem- 
ises cannot be ‘false’ They have no claims, and claims are always 
affective Like the ‘insane’, they follow up these premises blindly, but, 
being generally conscious of abstracting in the field of their profession, 
they are not usually subject to semantic disturbances in tins held and 
do not live out their theories m life, the theories thus remaining affec- 
tively hypothetical If a mathematician were to believe, wnth strong 
affective e\aluation, that his premises are ‘true’, these premises then 
w ould become mostly false, or meaningless, or, in general, inappropriate 
If he lived through them, the given indnidual w'ould then be ‘mentally’ 
ill, not because of his premises, but because of the semantic disturbance, 
which would involve erroneous evaluation, identifications, confusion of 
orders of abstractions m his affective attitude toward his premises This 
subtle organism-as-a-whole mechanism, m which all affectne pressure 



MATHEMATICS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS 309 


can be rationalized, and all rationalization can produce affective mani- 
festations, not only makes the present noii-cl analysis possible and legiti- 
mate, but also offers some explanation of those remarkable cases of 
'mental’ illness m a number of mathematical geniuses Under such 
organism-as-a-whole structural conditions, a general consciousness of 
abstracting not restricted to a special field is the only possible safeguard 
against the semantic disturbances which lead to an unbalanced 'mental’ 
condition. 

As we have seen, the difference between ‘sanity’ and ‘insanity’ is 
subtle The reader must be reminded that it takes a good ‘mind’ to be 
‘insane’. Morons, imbeciles, and idiots are ‘mentally’ deficient, but could 
not be ‘insane’. 

The so-called ‘sane’ also have structural premises , we all have some 
standards of evaluation These are also usually false, or, m general, 
inappropriate, hemg mostly due to our savage inheritance. But the 
saner we are, the less we abide by them Therefoie, in a world quite 
different structurally from our fancies, we are often able to adjust our- 
selves for all practical purposes, often avoiding major disasters for a 
number of years 

For instance, the believers in extraordinary blisses m the ‘other 
life’ or the ‘other world’ should welcome death Why be so unhappy 
here, when, according to their doctrines, there is such an ideally happy 
future after death ^ Why make use of medicine and doctors, when a 
deadly illness should open the door to everlasting bliss ' In conflict with 
such a creed, he lives as long as he can, often most unhappily, and is 
generally willing to spend fortunes on doctors and medicines to delay 
the bliss* The genuine and very serious danger to all of us of such 
creeds is that when the jr of an individual are trained m this r\ay he 
finally does become indifferent, or apathetic toward actualities in tins 
world, so that cunning, and often pathological, individuals are thus given 
an opportunity of directing human affairs toward their personal ends 

Naturally, with the increase of the complexities of conditions, the 
dangers also increase in a geometrical ratio, because when m o realities 
become too unbearable, the masses cease to be influenced by these seman- 
tic illusions, and they break all barriers, only to fall again under the 
influence of new leaders very often equally irresponsible and ignorant 

Unfortunately, the failure to understand these semantic issues, 
based on animalistic lack of foresight, results invariably in a great deal 
of unnecessary suffering There is little doubt that without these delu- 
sions and illusions we should look after the conditions of our actual 
lives more closely, and many of our pressing needs would be adjusted

The difficulties which we have are mostly man-made, and so only man- 
kind can remedy them, and any attempts to escape from mo reality 
only aggravate the situation 

Lack of space does not allow me to dwell here on many other 
aspects of mathematics which are of neurological structural importance, 
except to mention the theory of statistics and probability All human 
knowledge is neurologically due to a process of abstracting in different 
orders, giving us the only structural knowledge of processes, which, m 
1933, must always be considered on three levels, the macroscopic, the 
microscopic, and the sub-microscopic 

Because the nervous s}stem is an abstracting, integrating mechan- 
ism, all human psycho-neurological reactions and, particularly, psycho- 
logical, to be similar m structure, must be based on the mathematical 
theories of statistics and probability On the objective level, we deal with 
absolute individuals, and so all statements, or higher order abstractions, 
can only be probable Historically, mathematicians have elaborated not 
only both theories, but Boole, in his Laws of Thought, extended the 
mathematical approach to ‘logic’ in connection with the theory of proba- 
bility Finally, the difficulties of the law of excluded third have been 
solved by Lukasiewicz and Tarski*® in their ‘many-valued logic’, which, 
when N increases indefinitely, merges with the mathematical theory of 
probability, a result reached independently by a different type of analysis 
in the present sjstem Any possible future scientific A, non-el ‘logic’, 
which I call general semantics, must be built on this structurally more 
correct foundation It should be noticed that the notions of probability 
are very flexible, and entirely cover our structural needs, the field of 
degrees of probability ranging from impossibility to certainty This new 
semantics involves entirely new affective attitudes, and- underlies new 
and better balanced j r 

Under such conditions, the restricted ‘uncertainty principle’ of Heis- 
enberg becomes a structural, most revolutionary, and creative general 
principle, transferring the laws of two-Aalued ‘cause and effect’ from 
the realm of gambling on words by ‘philosophers’ to the scrutiny of 
scientists, and establishing cc-valued ‘determinism’ on a neuro-mathe- 
matical base of ‘the greatest probability’ Methodologically and psycho- 
logically, this requires full consciousness of abstracting, achieved, as yet, 
by extremely few of us, even among physicists and mathematicians 
Then the ‘law’ of twm-valued ‘cause and effect’, instead of depending on 
the el and objectified older interpretations, will be based on the mathe- 
matical, and much more reliable, oo-valued principle of greatest proba-

bility This will eliminate to a large extent semantic disturbances, and 
so the problems of sanity will be greatly helped towards solution 

To those who are accustomed to the disclaimers made by many 
mathematicians of human values in their work, such an analysis as I 
have given in the present chapter must seem unexpected But, upon 
reflection, we may see that, after all, it is only a natural evaluation 
Language is a unique, and, therefore, most important, human character- 
istic Ought we to wonder that these linguists of exact sciences, whom 
we call mathematicians, should have produced unknowingly and unwit- 
tingly great human values, fundamentally affecting the rr? They could 
not help it Once they worked out their own problems properly — and 
no one doubts that they did it well — ^the results were bound to have 
broad human significance Their activities were kept on the proper levels 
and so were naturally a help toward sanity In Part VH, I shall discuss 
another mathematical discovery, known as the ‘theory of mathematical 
types’, of Russel], which, when generalized, becomes a physiological 
theory of enormous semantic importance and of fundamental and con- 
stant human application 

In spite of popular belief, mathematics is the simplest language in 
existence Our daily language is so very complex in its structure that 
for many thousand years it evaded analysis Probably, the writer, with- 
out the study of mathematics, would not have been able to discover the 
ultimately extremely simple yet workable principles outlined in the pres- 
ent work. 




PART VI 


ON THE FOUNDATION OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


It IS an important principle of physiological epistemology that a phe- 
nomenon which occurs generally, cannot possibly be the specific function 
of an organ which is peculiar to a few forms only (so® jacques loeb 


1 have observed, as a consequence of serious and repeated emotional 
shocks, very curious cases of infantilism m adults, where complete amnesia, 
accompanying sexual inhibition and disturbances of the affective area, 
produced the mentality and conduct of a little child (4ii) henki fieron 


The organism is reacting as a whole to its environment as a whole, and 
it IS doing so in ways that cannot be formulated in terms of an algebraic 
sum or simple mechanical resultant of the interplay of the simple reflex 
responses to external stimulation the mechanisms of traditional reflex- 
ology seem hopelessly inadequate. ( 22 ® c. judson bebsice

CHAPTER XX 


GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

We know also how different extra stimuli inhibit and discoordinate a 
well-established routine of activity, and how a change in a pre-established 
order dislocates and renders difficult our movements, activities and the 
whole routine of life (394) l p pavlov 

The experiments show that- a compound stimulus the component units 
of which remain themselves unaltered, and consequently most probably 
affect the same cells of the cerebral cortex, behaves in different modifica- 
tions as a different stimulus, evoking in these cells now an excitatory 
process and now an inhibitory one (394) i p pavlov 

We thus come to the following conclusion when perfectly neutral stimuli 
fall upon the hemispheres at a time when there prevails a state of inhibition 
they acquire an inhibitory function of their own, so that when they act 
subsequently upon any region of the biain which is in a state of excitation 
they produce inhibition (394) l p pavlov 


Some of the most important researches in the function of the higher 
nervous centres have been done lately by Professor Pavlov m his work 
on the so-called ‘conditioned reflexes’ This work was det eloped in a 
senes of papers covering a period of nearly thirty years of experimenta- 
tion, but the average international scientist did not know this work as 
an entirety, because the papers were scattered and written mostly m 
Russian Only in 1927 did the Oxford Press publish Pavlov’s Condi- 
tioned Reflexes, an Investigation of the Physiological Activity of the 
Cerebral Cortex in the English translation of Doctor G V Anrep , and 
in 1928 The International Publishers (New York) published Pavlov's 
Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes, Twenty-five Years of Objective 
Study of the Higher Nervous Activity (Behaviour) of Animals in the 
translation of Doctor W Horsley Gantt Both translators were collabo- 
rators of Professor Pavlov in Leningrad for a number of jears In 
these two books, the latest experiments and interpretations are given 

Hitherto, most of the researches on the function of the higher 
nervous systems were formulated in ‘psychological’ languages, which, 
obviously, are not fit for physiological disciplines Professor Pailov, 
himself, suggests this fact as an e.xplanation why, until his work, the 
physiology of the cerebral cortex was so little known There is no doubt 
that the descriptive physiological language of happenings, functionings , 
used by him exclusively, is responsible for his results This language 
suggests structurally new experimentations, which suggestions are lack- 
ing in other accounts of the kind where antiquated ‘psychological’ terms 
are used 

Although I knew as much as the average scientist about the work 
of Pavlov, this knowledge was not integrated enough to make some

issues dear But, after I had formulated my /4-system, I read the 
books of Pavlov and found, to my great satisfaction, that a neurological 
mechanism, the analysis of which underlies my own work, and the exist- 
ence of which was independently discovered by me on theoretical 
grounds, had been discovered by Professor Pavlov and his co-workers 
on expeumental grounds, thus supplying additional experimental veri- 
fication for my system 

It seems that the so-called 'ethics’ , in general, sanity, which underlie 
desirable human characteristics have a definite physiological mechanism, 
automatically involving on psycho-logical levels these desirable semantic 
attitudes It appears that some of the psycho-logical problems enor- 
mously complex and difficult to reach, or even inaccessible, are sohed, 
not by preaching, but by the most simple and elementary physiological 
training, a fact which has been verified empirically Obviously, such 
simplification, if at all possible, must be of fundamental importance 

Physiology' deals, m the mam, with the functioning of organs m 
organisms, and results in various formulations Thus, there might be 
an hypothetical ‘physiological theory of most effective feeding’, for in- 
stance, stating that food should be secured first in one’s hand, or spoon, 
or fork, before putting it in the mouth , A group of people who habitu- 
ally disregarded the ‘physiological theory’ and abandoned attempts to act 
in accordance \\ith it after the first unsuccessful one, would be badly 
underfed or would simply perish Facts of experience show that some 
such ‘physiological theory’ must have been known and applied from time 
immemorial, and that, perhaps, because of it we survive at all ' 

How about the ‘mental’ field ^ As I demonstrate — and close observa- 
tion will verify this very generally — ^the existing theories of ‘mental’ 
life, closely related with our linguistic habits, are A, grossly inadequate, 
and lead to a wholesale production of morons, imbeciles, ‘emotionally’ 
disturbed, and, in general, un-sane individuals Investigation shows the 
possibility of a simple and obvious physiological theory of the use of our 
nervous system, which automatically leads to desirable psycho-logical, 
semantic states of general sanity. 

In the frivolous example of a ‘physiological theory of feeding’ given 
above, the problems of order were important. In the physiological 
theory of sanity, order becomes paramount Processes and function 
involve series of states, by necessity exhibiting order. Adjustment to 
life-conditions means adjustment of processes, and a physiological theory 
of sanity must be based structurally on four-dimensional order, where 
‘space’ and ‘time’ are indivisibly interwoven. 



GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 


317 


Pavlov shows, m an unusually impressive variety and numbers of 
experiments, how ‘order’ and ‘delay’ (four-dimensional order, in the 
language used here in this connection) are intimately related with most 
fundamental processes in the higher nervous centres, and how, by the 
changes or interplays of them, we can produce or eliminate pathological 
states of the nervous system 

In the human field we find a quite similar situation, unanalysable 
by older methods, because all order involves asymmetrical relations, 
which, as we have already shown, cannot be dealt with by A means 

The issue is clear and definite either we persist in our old A habits 
of speech, m which case asymmetrical relations and order e\ade our 
grasp, and proper evaluation and sanity are physiologically impossible, 
or we build a yd-system free, or at least more free, from these eialua- 
tional limitations, which allows us to deal with order, and sanity becomes 
physiologically possible. 

‘Stimuli are never “simple”, and, by necessity, involve fourfold 
space-time structure and order Survival values involve, also, this four- 
dimensional order For instance, the natural survival order is “senses” 
first, “mind” next, object first, label next, description first, inference 
next , . The reversal of the natural order appears pathological and patho- 
genic and is found as a symptom in practically all forms of “mental” 
ills, as well as in most human difficulties and disturbances which, at 
present, are still not considered abnormal. Thus, objectivity is ascribed 
to words, “mind” projected into “senses”, inferences evaluated as descrip- 
tions . , — quite common “symptoms” . . Observations on human levels 
show that we still copy animals iii our nervous responses, confuse orders 
of abstractions (non-existent for the animals), leading fatalistically to 
the reversal of the natural order and to pathological results, making the 
great majority of us un-sane ’* 

A structural non-el enquiry into the objective world shows quite 
clearly that no event is ever ‘simple’, it is, at least, a limited whole of 
interrelated factors The eventual ‘simplicity’ is manufactured by a 
nervous process of higher and higher abstractions 

In our consideration of ‘order’ and ‘delay’, and the role they play in 
connection with the activities of the nervous system, we must first dis- 
criminate sharply between the objective level which is unspeakable, 
because anything that can be said is not the object, and the verbal level, 
on which we can, at will, concentrate attention on similarities, or differ- 
ences, or both Secondly, we must pay special attention to structure —

Congress of Mental Hygiene New York, 19.'52

that is to say, search for structure in the empirical world, and, once this 
has been found, adjust, accordingly, the structure of our language 

The structure of the daily, as well as of the ‘philosophical’, lan- 
guage, which we inherited, in the mam, from our primitive ancestors, is 
such that we have separate terms for factors which are not separable, 
such as ‘matter’, ‘space’, ‘time’, or ‘body’, ‘soul’, ‘mind’, . Then, as it were, 
we try to make out of the word, flesh, by reversing the natural order 
and affectively ascribing a delusional objectivity to these terms. 

If we deal with the silent, un-speakable, objective level and try to 
divide according to the implications of the verbal division, we find a 
brutal fact, which, until Einstein and Minkowski, has escaped scientific 
verbal formulation, that this cannot be done at all On the objective 
level every dealing with ‘matter’ involves ‘space’ and ‘time’ ; any dealing 
w ith ‘space’ involves some fulness of something and ‘time’ ; and every 
dealing with ‘time’ involves ‘something’ and ‘space’ 

The structure of the world happens to be such that empirically ‘mat- 
ter’, ‘space’, ‘time’, cannot be divided, wherefore, we should have a 
non-el language of similar structure This was accomplished by Einstein- 
Minkowksi, when they created a language of ‘space-time’, in which the 
hard lumps against which we bump our noses are connected analytically 
with the curvature of space-time 

In this new, non-el, four-dimensional language, every three-dimen- 
sional point of ‘space’ has a date, and so is different For our purpose, 
w'e do not need, at present, to bother much about its curvature or the 
kinks in space-time, called m the old way ‘matter’, but we must empha- 
size that the fourfold order is of great importance, as it corresponds 
structurally to experience, and is intimately connected with physiological 
reactions, the semantic included 

There is a great deal of confusion about these problems among 
laymen and also among scientists From a structural point of view, the 
issues are quite simple, and there is nothing sensational in the latest 
announcement of Einstein that ‘space’ in its importance is displacing 
‘matter’ (Nottingham Lectures) Naturally, the statement in this form 
IS rather baffling and attracted much — even newspaper — attention Yet 
It seems that even the einstemists do not fully realize the verbal, struc- 
tural, and semantic issues involved 

For the layman, as well as for the majority of the physicists in their 
less sober, or metaphysical, moments, ‘space’ is ‘emotionally’ newtonian 
and an ‘absolute void’, w'hich, of course, being ‘absolute nothingness’, 
cannot have objective existence, by definition For Einstein, ‘space-time’ 
IS, semantically, ‘fulness’, not ‘emptiness’, and, in his language, he does

not need any term like ‘ether’, as his ‘plenum’, structurally, covers the 
ground, without his committing himself to a definite two-valued mechan- 
istic ether. The confusion of orders of abstractions, from which we all 
suffer, is semantic, and is due to disregard of the structure and role of 
language If we accept a nmi-el language of space-time, structurally we 
deal with fulness, and we should not use the term ‘space’, as its old 
semantic implications are ‘emptiness’ and so are very confusing The 
‘sensation’ of Einstein’s declaration amounts to the fact that the sub- 
microscopic fulness (‘space’) is more important than a few kinks or 
concentrations' of that fulness (‘matter’), — a fact which science has 
established, and which is quite obvious 

Experiments with ‘conditioned reflexes’ have established firmly the 
fact that stimuli can be compounded, and that, when established, the 
compound stimulus acts as a unit, and that a change m the four-dimen- 
sional order of factors (including delays) acts as a different stimulus, 
not necessarily resulting in the established reflex This often introduces 
great complexities 

As an example of this, we will use the so-called ‘delayed refle.x’ 
When established, the ‘conditioned reflex’ does not appear at once after 
the stimulation, but after the stimulation combined with the usual ‘tinie’- 
delay has occurred, thus showing that the ‘time’ factor plays a physio- 
logical role m a compound stimulus. Organisms live in, and consist 
of, periodic processes, such as the alternation of day and night, sleep, 
taking in food, heart-beats, breathing, electronic pulsations , so that any 
stimulus, no matter how nominally ‘simple’, is, in reality, a compound 
stimulus of, let us say, x and y heart-beats and what not An organism 
represents, invariably, a clock of some sort, and, when that clock stops, 
life ceases 

Under such actual structural conditions a four-dimensional analysis 
makes every ‘simple’ stimulus compound, and thus four-dimensional 
order becomes a potent physiological factor, exerting definite effects 
The interplay of four-dimensional order of factors represents, m general, 
a new stimulus , we have an interplay of positive and negative excitations 
which may lead to clashes between the two that the nervous system finds 
difficult to resolve, and so pathological results follow 

If we pass to sub-microscopic levels and processes, we find that, 
although we may speak of them as ‘chemical’ or ‘stimuli of greater 
physiological strength’ , yet, by structural necessity, they represent dif- 
ferent kinds of multt-dnnensional order, because, as we say in 1933, the 
dynamic physical unit of that order is a quantum of action The meta- 
physician should not get excited about this statement, because whatever

he might say will also be a verbal statement of a given date, made 
mostly without any structural considerations, and based mostly upon 
the reversed sundval order, confusion of orders of abstractions and 
other semantic disturbances. As the world, both outside and inside our 
skins, IS invariably found to exhibit a fourfold space-time order, it is 
inevitable that this order should be structurally impressed on the ner\'ous 
system, establishing a natural suiwival order Therefore, changes m this 
order on the macroscopic level, the level of outward events, must haie 
direct inward sub-microscopic effects, disturbing or restoring the nervous 
equilibrium This statement may appear innocent, it is not, it has a 
vital human significance, as it involves standards of evaluation In short, 
it means that, in the actual application of the consideration of order in 
education and training on the daily-life levels, w'e can affect the e\ asive 
(as jet) microscopic and sub-microscopic structural leiels of the human 
nervous system, thus directly affecting our j r and behaviour 

To make this clearer, let us recall some of the neurological researches 
of Bolton (as quoted by Herrick) The cortex has different layers, char- 
acterized by the difference in the number, size, shape, internal structure, 
and density of neural cells Bolton’s third layer of granules divides the 
cortex into two tj pes of layers Those closer to the base of the brain, or 
below the third, are called the infragranular, those above, the supra- 
granular, layers.

logical order, and bring about inch great harm, individually and col- 
lectively It enables us to understand, also, why all forms of ‘mental’ ills 
invariably exhibit infantile charactei istics of some soit 

If w^e train a child with a ph}'sically undeveloped nervous system in 
animalistic doctrines strictly connected with a primitive-made language 
of wrong structure, in the pathological reversed oi der of responses, such 
semantic training must afiect harmfully the still developing nervous 
system So, w'hen we say, and demonstrate, that we still copy animals 
m our nervous responses, W'e imply an undeveloped or thwarted nervous 
system, of which the development has been arrested or made regressive 
Such a deficiency, of course, is superimposed functionally, and so struc- 
turally, upon whatever congenital deficiency there might have been in a 
given case We are neaily all m a situation of this kind We continue 
to be educated under animalistic conditions since we became time-binders, 
which, from a biological point of view, is a very recent event, and it is 
not rash to assume that our nervous S3’stem is still not fully developed, 
the more so that we submit the cortex, wdiich m childhood is still incom- 
plete, to injurious semantic influences Obviously, such a fundamental 
human function as language, when used in a way not in correspondence 
with the structure of the nervous system, must act detrimentally on its 
development 

In congenital extreme imbecility, the cortex is poorly organized, 
thin, and deficient in nerve cells, and the infiagianular layers show less 
impairment than the supragraniilar la}ers It seems that Bolton’s second 
supragranular layer is the last to mature, and its relative development 
corresponds to the relative development of an animal or human being, 
and, in a w'ay, it goes parallel with the so-called ‘intelligence’ 

In human defectives, its deficiency corresponds with the degree of 
psycho-logical arrest, regression, or deterioration Let us recall that 
these ‘mental’ deficiencies, which, in behaviour as w'ell as in nervous 
structure, take us one step (or several) back toward the level of the 
infant, or even to that of the animal, are always connected with infantile 
behaviour in adults, and semantic disturbances 

Nervous as well as muscular tissues have differentiated from the 
general protoplasm, and w^e know positively that, through tiainmg, we 
can enlarge or otherwise improve muscular tissues, and there is no reason 
to doubt that something similar can be done to nervous tissue All educa- 
tion, and the establishing of any conditional or j r, shows this, although 
in a rather vague way 

If , by a physiological training based on order, we can alter a nervous 
deficiency, as showm by behaviour, we may conclude that there are physio-

logical means by which we can effectively train and help the development 
of nervous cells and supragranular layers — or, at least, not hinder their 
natural development On the macroscopic levels, this beneficial training 
consists in forming habits of proper evaluation through the natuial sur- 
\ival order The effect of this on the sub-microscopic level is neural, 
colloidal, and structural, a result which, by the older methods, could not 
be reached, either with ease or with effectiveness 

Although these conclusions are necessary, it is impossible directly to 
verify them empiricallj, because we should have to dissect the brain of a 
given person before, and during, the training In this case, as m many 
others, we have to observe 'human nature’ and semantic responses to 
stimuli of a given individual before and after the training , and, on the 
foundation of what we know of the development of the nervous system 
m animals, infants, ‘mentally’ defective and well-developed adults, build 
our eventual conclusion as preliminary hypotheses for further structural 
testing, improvement, and empirical verification 

To realize fully the importance and necessity of this conclusion, we 
must first understand that, in accordance with the modern discoveries of 
mathematics, ph) sics, chemistry, colloidal chemistry, and other branches 
of science, all ‘function’ depends on structure, because the unit-brick of 
structure represents a dynamic unit of a quantum of action In the 
remarks which follow, it is impossible to be as full and precise as I 
should like to be, because to be able to do so would be equivalent to being 
able to solve all scientific problems , yet the reader should realize that the 
considerations of structure will become extremely creative and helpful as 
long as we recognize a quantum of action, or any other dynamic unit 
Wc may recall that the characteristics of molecules are due to atomic 
structure, and that the chaiacteristics of atoms are due to electronic 
structure The latest quantum theories also seem to find that the char- 
acteristics of electrons are an outgrowth of structure, and, if the sug- 
gestions of Dirac are verified, even the difference between positive and 
negative electricity is structural Even at present it appears that ‘struc- 
ture’ IS not only a teim fit to handle and explain, but that it has an 
objective counterpart, allowing a similarity of structure, and, therefore, 
making the understanding of this world possible 

This last very important semantic point is based on the fact that 
relations of similar structure have similar ‘logical’ characteristics, and 
that, therefore, in structure we find means by which the events can 
always be made intelligible to us, and so properly evaluated 

Experience — my own, as well as that drawn from scientific litera- 
ture — impresses me with the fact that we very seldom realize that our

‘knowledge’ (or, roughly, what we can say) ts not ‘it’, as the ‘it’ is 
always un-speakable 

Between two houses or two stones, there is some sort of sub- 
microscopic interaction , but on the macroscopic level, nothing definite 
happens So we say that in the given context or configuration, the units 
under consideration are too heavy (implying gravitational structure), or 
the medium, the plenum in which they are immersed, is too light (again 
structural implications) and so, macroscopically, nothing obvious happens 

If that structure is changed, different conditions, different relations 
and results prevail Thus, if the particles are very small, and the media 
not too heavy, the surface phenomena, electrical charges , begin to play 
an important role We then have colloidal behaviour of enormous com- 
plexity and variability where we find, not necessarily life, but many 
inorganic forms, duplicating some forms found in life Obviously, col- 
loidal structure accounts for that ^ 

When little colloidal wholes, most probably of specialized internal 
structure, arise, we may have not only colloids, but also little wholes, 
separated by a membrane, or perhaps by surface phenomena, which rep- 
resent a most generalized membrane We may have a new structural 
fact, an interplay of the inside with the outside, and life begins. 

The general irritability and conductivity of protoplasm is known 
to be strictly connected with permeability to the passage of ions and, 
therefore, is a structural phenomenon On this structural foundation, 
physiological gradients result, fonning a dynamic field of forces, again 
involving structure The development of the differentiated tissue of 
muscles and nerves consists of higher order complex structures, based 
on more primitive structures , and, finally, function and behaviour of all 
life, man included, is due to sub-microscopic, microscopic, and macro- 
scopic structure. 

I may be reproached by specialists that, although what I have just 
said may possibly be true, yet, actually, to make these assertions is, per- 
haps, premature, in 1933, because we lack too many details 

My answer is sharp and definite, and may be considered a serious 
scientific suggestion, because it can be made legitimately in this form: 

1) All science depends on human 'knowledge’ 

2) All human ‘knowledge’ is structurally circular and self-reflexive, 
and so depends on some consaous or unconscious theory of knowledge 
and undefined terms 

3) Words are not the things we speak about , and, therefore, 

4) The only possible connection between the objective and un- 
speakable levels and words is structural, introducing

5) Structural anal3’sis of languages as fundamental , making 

6) The only possible content of ‘knowledge’ structural, and 

7) All science becomes a search for the unknown structure of the 
empirical world on all levels, and the matching of this unknown structure

necessitating 

12) Unique methods of translation of djnamic into static, and Mce

world and the static languages 

13) Such unique methods of translation are given in the differential 
calculus and four-dimensional geometncs, m which 

14) \\'hat in a four-dimensional language is structure becomes in 
three-dimensional language ‘importing time’ function, showing once

also the most creative and helpful for tlie future development of science 
and man, and justifying the above assertions, with the setback that 

16) Full 1933 structural analysis, being one of the, or perhaps the, 
highest abstraction of this date, the mastering of that language may 
represent some difficulties 

The reader must be reminded (see, for details, Part VII) that the 
terms ‘structure’, ‘function’ , are multiordinal terms with many meanings, 
and so that they have no general meaning apart from context, but have 
definite meaning m each context Without this realization of the multi- 
ordinality of terms, the statement above could not be made, for it is a 
structural statement about languages 

As an example of the immense and inherent importance of consid- 
erations of foiir-dimcnsional order, the following psychological experi- 
ment for which Doctor Harry Helson has suggested lately the name of 
Tau effect, is useful ’ 

If we stimulate three spots of the skin by touching them lightly w ith 
the end of a pencil m quick succession, and if the distance between the 
first and the second spots is say, 20 mm , and that between the second 
and the third is 10 mm , but the ‘time’ interval betw'een the second and

325 


the third stimulations is twice as long as that between the first and the 
second, the distance between the second and the third spots will be judged 
as nearly twice as great as that between the first and second Similar 
results are obtained with other analyseis, such as vision and hearing 
If we change the conditions of the experiment, the results may be 
reversed It is interesting to note that the effect does not depend on 
‘knowing’, as similar results happen when the subject knows the condi- 
tions of the experiment The last shows that the experiment deals with 
a physiological and neurological mechanism In general terms, if we 
vary the time-interval in the opposite sense from the space-interval, the 
latter will be distorted, showing once more the structural fact that in 
actual life and experience we deal exclusively with the four-dimensional 
space-time order, which, as such, must have physiological and neuro- 
logical significance, and an adapting mechanism 



CHAPTER XXI 


ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 

The conditioned reflex is conventionally regarded as differing essentially 
from the unconditioned reflex, but this is contradicted by evidence drawn 
from the development of behavior oot) g e. coghcll 

The mam experiments of Pavlov were made on dogs, animals with 
a rather well-developed nervous sjstem, and so most of what he has to 
say IS about dogs, although some general phj siological facts apply to all 
the higher nervous systems, man included In some instances, because 
of human complexities, some results must be re-mterpreted. structural 
linguistic re-adjustments made, and some obscuring, wrong-in-structure, 
el ‘psj chological' terms anahsed and rejected M\ linguistic, structural, 
iwii-el, theoretical revision leads to a new and important enlargement of 
the application to man of the Pavlov experimental theorj' of 'conditioned' 
reflexes The fact that these independent discoveries reinforce and 
support each other is a striking instance of the usefulness of theoretical 
researches 

We must take care to notice and beware of the diflerences in lan- 
guages -\ny happening has as many aspects as there are sciences, or 
even human interests Thus, if we speak about an objective ‘pencil , we 
may speak about its chemistry, or methods of manufacturing, its uses, 
prices, markets , . As the content of knowledge is structural, we must 
search empirically for structure, understood nowadays always on three 
levels (the term being multiordinal), the macroscopic gross structure 
the microscopic, and sub-microscopic structures 

When we deal with life phenomena, we have also different lan- 
guages dealing with their different aspects Thus, a biological language 
would cover eventually the vutal events in general, a phv siological lan- 
guage would be narrower and cover the analysis of phenomena in an 
organism, the function of its organs and the conditions and the mech- 
anism which determine these functions, a neurological language would 
be physiological as applied only to the nervous system The day is not 
distant when all these problems will be formulated m the language of 
the quantum mechanics. 

A psycho-logical language is legitimate only on human levels, as 
we never know, or can know, what an animal ‘thinks’, ‘feels’., and on 
human levels it applies to so-called ‘psychic’ phenomena only' 

Usually, one extremely fundamental semantic fact is disregarded , 
namely, that W'hat on the psy'cho-logical level is objective and in language 
descriptive to one person (e g , ‘my toothache’) , is inferential to the other 

326 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


327 


person, and vice versa The lack of consciousness of abstracting intro- 
duces, by structural necessit}’, an identification of orders of abstractions , 
namely, the confusion of descriptions with inferences, and vice versa 
This makes it imperative to a\oid psjcho-logical language as much as 
possible It IS also bad epistemology to use a language w hich applies to a 
few individuals (psjcho-logics) for describing functions uhich are much 
more general, and t\hich, fundamentally, apply to all organisms 

It IS a striking fact that, although physiology is a fairly old and well- 
developed discipline, yet the purely physiological approach to the study 
of the brain-functions is very recent, and, m the mam, has been earned 
on by Pavlov and his follow eis Pavlov gives us a simple yet profoundly 
tiue explanation, namely, that the higher nervous centres have never 
been treated on equal footing with other organs, or other parts of the 
nervous system The activities of the hemispheres have been treated 
from a ‘psychological’ point of \iew, and, by analogy, we have asciibed 
to animals similar ‘psychological’ states, a remnant of primitive animism 
As such attitudes have become more and more obviously absurd, we have 
drifted into the opposite absurdity of animalism, ascribing animal charac- 
teristics to man, forgetting that the human nervous system is far more 
complex, matures later than in any animal, and is a non-additive affair 
Naturally, reasoning by such analogies must be fallacious 

The prevalent complete disregard of the fact that these issues are 
linguistic and structural makes the advances in these fields very slow and 
halting, and only so-called ‘geniuses’ are capable of breaking through 
these semantic barriers Once the linguistic character of the issues is 
fully realized, the psycho-logical, semantic blockage is removed, freedom 
of analysis is inwardly established, and even ‘non-geniuses’ wnll produce 
important creative work Indeed, we may find that wnth this realization, 
particularly if embodied in early education, the ‘normal’ man would be, 
what we call at present, a ‘genius’. 

This conclusion naturally follows if we abandon animalistic analo- 
gies and face the fact that high-grade human intelligence happens to be 
not less ‘natural’ and inheient in the history of evolution than any other 
‘tropism’. By eliminating the ps} cho-logical semantic blockage due to 
copying animals in our ner\ous reactions, we may handle this impoitant 
human function of language properly Wan will function as man, in 
accordance with the structure of his moie complex nervous system 
There is no doubt at present that some oiganisms called ‘man’ have an 
important function connected with sr called ‘speech’, perhaps the most 
complex and involved and also unique function evolved by this class of 
life, and which it does not yet know how to use. Biologically and physio- 



32S

logically, this misuse of a function must be a non-survtval tendency for 
this class of life 

Sanity must be based on methods for the most efficient use of the 
human nervous system, in accordance with its structure, and will thus 
bring about the full working of human capacities, which at present are 
still semantically blocked by faulty handling of the apparatus. 

Before going further, I will analj’se and suggest the complete elim- 
ination from the English language of the term ‘conditioned’ reflex, which 
is structurally false to facts, and suggest in its place the uniform use of 
the term ‘conditional’ reflex, introduced by Pavlov and used occasionally 
by some English writers I \\ ill also suggest the elimination of a psycho- 
loqical term, ‘inhibition’, from physiology and neurology, in which it 
should have no place at all. Such a change m language leads to new 
results, and also suggests new experiments It is little known and seldom 
taken into consideration that long ago Locke was quite clear on the point 
that the misuse of language has often been taken for deep mysteries of 
science , but Locke, unfortunately, did not take into consideration struc- 
ture, and j r , so his arguments were, in general, non-operative. 

As ever} thing in this actual \\ orld is structurally interrelated with 
ever} thing else, we should consciously look for interrelations, in which 
case we have to build special languages for the eventual synthesis As 
we must first ascertain empirical structure, and only then com the lan- 
guages, obviously to stait with a desciiptive, impersonal, non-'psycho- 
logical’ language of ordered events on a given level is most important 

In our case, we are investigating the structural and semantic prob- 
lems m connection with language We have to accept the structural 
facts as discovered by physicists, physiologists, neurologists, and other 
scientists, and then build a language similar in structure to the empirical 
world The language in which the present theory is formulated is a 
physiological and neurological one, as it deals with observed impersonal 
functionings of the oigamsms called ‘man’ When we reach results in a 
physiological language, these have, naturally on the human level, a psycho- 
logical aspect, and perhaps the mam importance, and even value, of the 
present work is that it reaches the very difficult psycho-logical, semantic 
level by purely functional and easily controlled physiological methods 

Thus the reader must translate for himself, as nobody else can do it 
for him, the ph} siological results into his psycho-logical feelings and 
attitudes and evoke the un-speakable s r These must be evoked by the 
reader, otherwise he will inevitably miss the point For instance, if it is 
said that ‘the objective level is un-speakable’, the reader should try to 
|become entirely ‘emotionally’ impassive, outwardly and inwardly silent

329 


i about an object, or a feeling, as whatever we may say is not 'tf. This, 
obviously, involves a complete checking of affective responses, ‘precon- 
ceived ideas’ , making him an ‘impartial observer’. In fact, to do this 
successfully is something very difficult to achieve, requiiing long seman- 
tic training with the Structural Differential, and usually involving a com- 
plete reversal of our habitual modes of affective responses. 

Similarly, when we speak of ‘natural order’ or reversal of this 
order, let the reader try actually to evoke these j r, and he will find it is 
not so easy, as it involves a completely new process of re-evaluation In 
both cases, we can gam physiological, easily operating means to re- 
educate the very stubborn semantic responses, by functional and ordinal 
methods The difficulties are only serious with grown-ups , they present 
no difficulties in the early semantic training of infants, for whom this 
training becomes a powerful preventive method against future nervous 
disturbances (limited, of course, to this aspect of un-sanity) 

Directly such a semantic re-education is accomplished, the formerly 
impossible is also performed, and ‘human nature’ has been changed 
Obviously, the trouble has not been with ‘human nature’, but with the 
lack of physiological and educational means to affect the psycho-logical 
level and to change the s i The above applies to the so-called ‘normal’ 
man, as well as to the ‘mentally’ ill It works with both types, provided 
the latter is in a condition to be at all accessible to approach 

The term ‘nervous reflex’ was originated by the mathematician 
Descartes Structurally, it was a genuinely scientific notion It implies 
necessity, namely, that a stimulus results m a response Obviously, if 
such were not the case, an animal would not be in sufficient correspon- 
dence with its environment and could not survn e Thus an animal must 
be attracted and not repelled by food, it must avoid fire and so forth ^ 
The term ‘reflex’ is usually used m connection with A two-valued 
implications, this makes reflexology el and generally inadequate to 
account for organic noii-cl resjjonscs in the colloidal sense Ina/f-system 
based on the oo-valued semantics of probability, I piefer to avoid the 
two-valued implication and use the teim reaction instead 

The mam function of the nervous system is the co-ordination of all 
activities of the organism for its preserv'ation Thus there must be no 
conflict between the opposing activities of different parts of the organ- 
ism, and any action must ultimately benefit the whole There may be a 
eonflict of different excitations, but one must finally dominate the others, 
as otherwise co-ordination would be impossible 

If food or some noxious material is put into the mouth of a dog, a 
secretion of saliva is produced, either to alter the food chemically and 



330 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


help digestion, or to wash the mouth out and eliminate it. But observa- 
tion shows further that other factors, not food or noxious materials 
alone, may produce similar secretions Thus, for instance, the sight or 
smell of some such material, or of the person who usually administers it, 
or even the latter’s footsteps may produce salivary secretions 

To make the experiments as exact as possible, the dogs obser\ed by 
Pavlov were submitted to minor operations Among others, the opening 
of the salivary duct was transplanted to the outside of the skin, so that 
all secretions could be carefully and exactly collected and measured 
The principle which underlies these experiments is the observation 
that if we combine some hitherto neutral stimulus, such as a definite 
tone, colour, or shape, with the presenting of the food or acid, after a 
few Inals this neutral stimulus acquires the potentiality of producing 
similar secretory effects as the food or acid itself 

This fundamental and exact method of experimentation allows con- 
siderable freedom in the selection of neutral stimuli, affecting, as we 
prefer, the visual, or auditory, or tactile, or other nerve centres of the 
animal We can also control their numbers, intensity, their combina- 
tions, the order and delays in their application , 

If food or noxious materials are placed in the mouth, the secretion 
of saliva IS an almost automatic reaction, ow'ing to the physico-chemical 
action of these materials Such reaction is inborn and practically general 
for a gnen species, the nervous paths for such reactions being mostly 
completed at birth Not so w ith the reactions produced by neutral stimuli, 
which acquire the secretory characteristics only after some experiences. 
These characteristics are reactions acquired during individual life, and 
the nervous paths and connections have to be completed during the 
lifetime of the individual 

Thus when puppies are shown meat or bread, which they had 
never eaten before, usually no salivary secretion appears Only after 
eating meat and bread on several occasions wull the sight of them produce 
secretions 

Some of the effects of these acquired reactions are very strong and 
lasting In some experiments, the dogs were given a hypodermic injec- 
tion of morphine The usual effect of the drug is to produce nausea 
with profuse secretion of saliva, follow'ed by vomiting and deep sleep 
In further experimenting, it was found that the preliminaries, or even 
seeing the experimenter, without injection, w'as often enough to produce 
the effects of the actual injection of the drug 

Pavlov studied the nervous mechanism of the functioning of the 
salivary glands, not because of any special physiological importance of 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


331 


these glands, but because such experimenting was the simplest, and the 
method used allowed him to conduct the most \aned experiments under 
accurate control 

The experiments disclosed an amazingly subtle and complex nervous 
mechanism, probably typical for the functioning of other glands of inter- 
nal secretions These findings, when translated into a language applicable 
to the human level, disclose a great deal about the nervous mechanism 
underlying so-called ‘associations’ and other ‘mental’, relational, or 
psycho-logical semantic manifestations. Usually, the salivar} glands are 
not supposed to be as closely connected with psjcho-logical manifesta- 
tions as the thyroid, the adrenals, and other glands are known to be 
It IS, therefore, a new and lery important general discoiery of Pavlov 
that the salivary glands have such intricate and far-reaching nervous 
interconnections 

The example of the dog reacting to the ‘associations’ (relations) of 
the experiment with morphine in a similar way as to the actual injection 
of the drug, is a close parallel to the example already given, of the 
patient who reproduced sjmptoms of hay fever at the sight of [>aper 
roses. In this case, the ‘associations’ were also uncritical, compulsory, 
almost automatic, of the type found m the animals In fact, this state- 
ment is very nearlj general, and we shall find later that most of ‘mental’ 
ills follow neurologically the patterns of animal responses, and so 
become pathological for man This obsenation has very far-reaching 
consequences, to be explained later, but we want to emphasize it from 
the beginning, and to stress the fact that copj mg animals in our ner\-ous 
reactions must be detrimental to humans. 

The above narrow s our problem considerably . we ha\ e to discover 
only the main differences betw een the nervous responses of animals and 
humans, and draw^ our conclusions 

The alimentary reactions to food and the mild defense-reaction to 
noxious materials may be roughly divided into two components, the 
secretory and the motor It was found possible to link another neutral 
stimulus to an already acquired reaction. Thus, if a dog was trained to 
respond to a bell, which was a sigpial for food, he could be trained, 
further, to link a formerly neutral stimulus, let us say, the sound of a 
buzzer, with the bell, and the bell with food Such a secondary acquired 
reaction may be called of the second order Naturally, it is very instruc- 
tive to find out if these responses could be extended to more orders 
Experiments disclosed the important fact that, as far as dogs and alimen- 
tary reactions are concerned, it was impossible to go beyond the second 
order. However, when defense reactions were tested, it w as found that 



332 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


it was possible to establish acquired reactions of the third order. But it 
was impossible to go bej ond the third order, even in these cases. 

In our field, where w e have to formulate sharp differences betu een 
the nervous responses of ‘man’ and ‘animal’, we say that animals stop 
abstracting or linking of signals on some level, while humans do not 
The latter abstract in indefinitely higher orders — at least potentially. 

Here ue encounter a fundamental and sharp far-reaching difference 
between the nervous functioning of ‘animal’ and ‘man’. This abstracting 
in indefinitely higher orders no doubt conditions the mechanism of uhat 
we call human ‘mentality’ If we stop this abstracting anywhere, and 
rest content with it, \\ e copy animals in our nen-ous processes, involving 
animalistic s r As will be shown later, this is the actual case with prac- 
tically all of us, ow ing to our A education and theories. This ‘copying 
animals’ m our nervous responses is, perhaps, a natural tendency at an 
extremely low level of development; but as soon as we understand the 
ph)‘siological mechanism, we can correct our education, with correspond- 
ing human semantic results Naturally, such ‘copying animals’ by humans 
must he a process of arrested development or regression It must be 
pathological for man, no matter how severe or how mild the affliction 
may be Various absolutists, and the ‘mentally’ ill m general, show this 
semantic mechanism clearly 

The reactions can be divided into two groups, those which are 
iuborn, almost automatic, almost unconditional, rather few and simple, 
belonging to the so-called ‘species’ , and those which are acquired during 
individual life, allow a great variety of complications, are conditional in 
different degrees, and are acquired by the mdnidual Pavlov suggests 
different terminologies , for instance, he calls the one ‘inborn’, the other 
‘acquired’ , or as usually incorrectly translated into English as ‘uncondi- 
tioned’ and ‘conditioned’ respectively The two last terms have received 
a scientific general acceptance, }et I w'ould suggest that m the English 
incorrect translation they are structuially unsatisfactory, and that par- 
ticularly, w'hen applied to humans, they carrj harmful implications. 
Structural!)', ‘inborn’ and ‘acquired’ are entirely satisfactorj'. Terms like 
‘conditional’ and ‘unconditional’ (m the original language of Pavlov), 
although less satisfactory, are more appropriate, as they do not imply 
some sort of ‘cause-lessness’ In fact, the ‘unconditioned’ salivary re- 
actions are conditioned and produced bj the physico-chemical effect of 
the food, and so to call them ‘unconditioned’ is structurally erroneous 
The terms ‘conditional’ and ‘unconditional’ do not have similar implica- 
tions, and carry others, as, for instance, the possibility of very important 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


333 


degrees of conditionality, establishing the uo-valued character of the 
reactions ; conditional meaning non-absolute, and non-one- valued 

For these structural reasons, I shall use the terms ‘inborn’ and 
‘acquired’ or else ‘unconditional’ and ‘conditional’ reactions 

Under natural conditions, an animal, to survive, must respond not 
only to normal stimuli, which bring immediate harm or benefit, but also 
to different physical and chemical stimuli, m themselves neutral, such as 
waves of sound or light , which are signals for animals and symbols for 
man The number of inborn reactions is comparatively small, and, alone, 
they are not sufficient for the survival of higher animals m their more 
complex environment. Experiments have made this point quite obvious 
A completely decorticated animal may retain his inborn reactions and 
become a kind of automatic mechanism, but all his subtlei means of 
adjustment, owing to acquired reactions, disappear, and if unaided he can 
not survive Thus, a decorticated dog will only eat when food is intro- 
duced into his mouth, and would otherwise die of starvation though food 
be placed all around him 

Experimental evidence seems to show that all higher activities of 
the nervous system, the whole signalizing apparatus, which underlies the 
formation and maintenance of the acquired conditional reactions, depend 
on the integrity of the cortex Stimuli which produce conditional re- 
actions are acting as signals of benefit or danger These signals are 
sometimes nominally ‘simple’, sometimes very complex, and the structure 
of the nervous system is such that it can abstract, analyse, and synthetize 
the factors of importance for the organism, and integrate them into 
excitatory complexes The analysing and synthetizing functions, as usual, 
overlap, and cannot be sharply divided, both functions being only aspects 
of the manifestation of the activity of the nervous system as-a-whole 
In general, one of the most important functions of the ceiebral cortex is 
that of reacting to innumerable stimuli of variable significance, which act 
as signals in animals and sjmbols in humans, and give means of very 
subtle adj'ustment of the organism to the environment. In psj'cho-logical 
terms, we speak of ‘associations’, ‘selection’, ‘intelligence’ , m mathemat- 
ical terms, of relations, structure, order., in psychophysiological terms 
of semantic reactions 

The language of reactions is of special interest because its structure 
IS similar to the structure of protoplasm in general and the nervous sys- 
tem in particular This language can be expanded and supplemented by 
the following further structural observations 

1 ) That reactions in animals and humans exhibit different degrees 
of conditionality ; 



334 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


2) That the signals and symbols may have different orders, indicat- 
ing superimposition of stimuli , 

3) That animals cannot extend their responses to signals of higher 
order indefinitely ; 

4) That humans can extend their semantic responses to higher 
order symbols indefinitely, and, in fact, have done so through language 
which IS always connected with some response, be it only repression or 
some other neurotic or psychotic mamfestations 

The above extension is structurally fundamental, because we can 
extend the vocabulary of conditional reactions to humans in all their 
functions Without it, we find ourselves saddled with a vocabulary which 
does not correspond in structure to the well-known elementary facts 
concerning Unman responses to stimuli, and we relapse into the old 
‘behaviourism’, which is structurally insufficient. 

The present system is based on such observations and extensions 
It w'as reached independently from structural and physico-mathematical 
considerations With this structural verbal extension, we can easily be 
convinced that everything that we call ‘education’, ‘habits’, ‘learning’ . on 
all levels is building up acquired or conditional and j r of different orders, 
as one of the differences betw een ‘man’ and ‘animal’ consists in the fact 
that humans can extend their symbolism and responses to indefinitely 
high orders, while with animals this power of abstracting and response 
stops someivhere We establish here a sharp distinction between the high 
abstractions ‘man’ and ‘ammal’, and so build up a psychophysiological 
and structurally satisfactory language. 

It IS obvious that the fundamental means which man possesses of 
extending his orders of abstractions indefinitely' is conditioned, and con- 
sists in general in symbolism and, in particular, in speech. Words, 
considered as symbols for humans, provide us with endlessly flexible 
conditional semantic stimuli, w’hich are just as ‘real’ and effective for 
man as any othei powerful stimulus 

Take, for instance, the example of the World War* Would the 
men m the tienches have endured at all the horrors they had to live 
through if it had not been for w'oids, and, neurologically speaking, 
because of the conditional sr connected w'lth woids^ 

‘If any question why w'e died. 

Tell them, because our fathers lied ’ 

said the poet truly, and experience shows it is not limited to the trenches ^ 

In interpreting the experiments on animals as applied to humans, it 
should be remembered that some of the expeiiments of Pavlov, as they 
stand, would be, at the least, neurotic for man. The reason for this is 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


335 


that the higher abstractions of man, which are due to the more developed 
complexities of his nervous system, would often make such simple ex- 
periments impossible Once a conditional reaction is established with an 
animal, no amount of any sort of ‘intellectual’ persuasion, or the like, 
would disturb his glandular secretions, as the animal’s range of ‘mean- 
ings’ is very limited These secretions can be diminished or even abol- 
ished by other means, but not by ‘intellectual’ means alone In the 
‘normal’ man, his ‘knowing’ that the sound of the metronome or bell is 
part of an experiment and not a signal for actual food, would, or should, 
alter his nervous reactions and glandular secretions and make the experi- 
ments much more complex The conditional reactions of the animals 
have still the element of unconditionality In man, they may become fully 
conditional and depend on a much larger number of semantic factors 
called ‘mental’, ‘psychic’ , than we find in any animal 

On the human level, outside of the experiments with the salivary 
glands, we have in the psychogalvanic reaction a most subtle semantic 
means of experimenting with the effect of words as connected with some 
secretions, probably at least the sweat glands. Humans react to different 
events or words by minute electrical currents (among others) which can 
be registered by a very sensitive galvanometer and the curves photo- 
graphed It IS interesting to notice that so-called ‘self-consciousness’ dis- 
turbs the success of the experiments, or makes them impossible, at least 
with some individuals It should be remembered that general statements 
are invalidated if there are any exceptions. 

In experiments, we are usually interested m their success When 
analysing the oo-valued degrees of conditionality, we are equally inter- 
ested in their failures, which suggest a far-reaching revision of the inter- 
pretation of our experimental data in this field Although some writers 
say that the reactions registered are ‘beyond control’ (unconditional), 
this statement, m general, is not correct, and should be amended to ‘often 
beyond control’ (conditional of different degrees) It is impossible to 
go into details here, as the problems are extremely complex In addition 
to this, the testing of degrees of conditionality presents an extremely 
wide new seinantie field for experimentation which has not yet been 
attempted It should be noted, however, in passing, that in these experi- 
ments different types of ‘mentally’ ill, as well as the ‘healthy’ persons, 
exhibit different types of curves ’ 

When psycho-logical events or jr are Interpreted, the difficulties 
become particularly acute Thus, we seldom discriminate between the 
average and the ‘normal’ person In the aniiiial world, under natural 
conditions — by which is meant entirely without human interference — 



336 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


the survival conditions are two-valued and very sharp The animals 
survive or they die out Because of this, it could be said, with regard to 
the animal world, with some sort of plausibility, that the average, with 
a long list of specifications, could be considered the ‘normal’ animal We 
usually enlarge this notion to humans and land m fallacies, particularly 
m so-called ‘psychological’ problems, which admittedly are very difficult 
In general medical science, such mistakes are made more seldom 
No physician, studying a colony of lepers or S 3 -philitics, could conclude 
that a ‘normal’ man should be a leper or a sj philitic. He would say that 
probably, in a given colon)’, the average person is afflicted with such 
and such a disease, and he would keep as his medical standard for desir- 
able health, a ‘normal’ man, that is to say, one free from this disease 
It IS true that m the example given above, outside of such rare 
colonies, we have a majority which, m respect to the given disease, are 
healthy, so we are empirically forewarned against fallacies, although 
existing theories of knowledge do not forewarn us But the mam point 
remains true , namely, that m human life the average 1933 does not mean 
‘normal’, and the standard for ‘normal’ will have to be established exclu- 
sively by scientific research In our present W'ork, we show that the 
average person copies animals m his psycho-logical and nervous pro- 
cesses, exhibits the unconditionality of nervous responses, confuses orders 
of abstractions, reverses the natural order , semantic symptoms of similar 
structure as found in obviously ‘mentally’ ill Therefore, the average 
person 1933 must be considered pathological If we take the animalistic 
a\erage for ‘normal’, and apply it to man, w’e commit a similar fallacy 
as that of treating a colony of lepers as a ‘normal’ or ‘healthy’ group 
In conditional jr of man, the average person cultnates, through 
inheritance and training in A doctrines, languages of inappropriate struc- 
ture , animalistic, nervous, and so psycho-logical, sr But here, as in 
general medicine, the average pathological situation should not be con- 
sidered ‘normal’ Only a structural study can disclose w'hat w'lth man 
should be considered ‘normal’ The present system performs this task 
to a limited degree and m various W’a)s, among others, by the revision 
and the widening of the reaction vocabulary to a larger structural con- 
ditionality, as found in the, as yet, exceptional ‘normal’ man, and intro- 
duces the important notion of von-cleincutalistic semantic reactions 
Because of this ‘average for normal’ fallacy, the theories of ‘con- 
ditional reflexes’ in man should be thoroughly revised and enlarged to 
include non-elementahstic semantic reactions, and then we should find 
that often what is ‘normal’ w'lth animals is quite pathological for man 
The semantic difficulties are serious, because the accepted two-valued 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


337 


structure of language and semantic habits reflect the primitive myth- 
ologies , so there is always the danger of drifting either into animalism, 
or into some other sort of equally primitive m3'st]cism. 

The net ps) cho-logical result of such a revision appears to be that, 
on structural grounds, what on human level appears as desiiable, and, at 
present, exceptional — as, foi instance, the complete conditionality of 
conditional and jr, based on the consciousness of absti acting — ought to 
be considered the rule for a ‘normal’ man Then the older animalistic 
generalizations will become invalid and reactions transformed But for 
this purpose, and to be able to apply these considerations in practice, we 
shall have to analyse ‘consciousness of abstracting’ and, theiefore, ‘con- 
sciousness’ which must be defined in simplei terms, discussed in Part VII 

When we deal with ‘mentally’ ill persons, the reactions n Inch would 
be conditional with ‘normal’ peisons become, in a sense, uncondmonal, 
compulsory, and semi-automatic iii effect, inwardly as well as outwardly 
As with animals, no amount of ‘intellectual’ pei suasion has any effect on 
them, and the reactions, secretions , follow automatically Fiom the 
ph3’siological point of view, ‘mental’ ills in humans compaie well with 
conditional reactions in animals It seems that under such circumstances 
a physiological language of different oiders of abstractions, different 
orders of conditional and J > would be structurally satisfactory. In such 
a language, we should pass from the inborn reactions, which exhibit the 
maximum of persistence, unconditionality, and almost automatic char- 
acter, to the acquired or conditional reactions in animals, which w'ould 
be called lower oi der conditional reactions, still, to some extent, auto- 
matic in their working, and, finally, to the much more flexible, variable, 
oa-valued and potentially fully conditional reactions in man, which we 
will call conditional i eactions of higher orders wdneh include the seman- 
tic reactions. 

In such a vocabulary, the mam term ‘reaction’ would be retained 
as a structural implication, yet the degrees of conditionality would be 
established by the terms of ‘lower order’ or ‘higher order’ conditional 
reactions Such a language would have the enoimous advantage of being 
physiological and oo-valued Structurally, it would be in accordance 
with what we know fioni psychiatry, namely, that the ‘mentally’ ill ex- 
hibit arrested deielopment or regressive tendencies 

We would say that ‘mental’ illness exhibits not only arrested devel- 
opment or regression, but we could state definitely that the fully con- 
ditional (oo-valued) reactions of higher order have not developed enough, 
or have degenerated (regression) into less conditional (few-valued) 
reactions of lower oiders as found m animals. All the ‘phobias’, 

22 



338 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


'panics’, 'compulsory actions’, identifications or confusions of orders of 
abstractions . , show a similar semantic mechamsm of mis-evaluation. 
Although they naturally belong to the so-called ‘conditional reactions’, 
yet, being imperMous to reason, thej- ha\e the one-valued character of 
uncoiiditiomlity, as m animals 

Similarly with the difference between signals and symbols The 
signal with the animal is less conditional, more one-valued, ‘absolute’, 
and involves the animal m the responses which we have named condi- 
tional reactions of lower order Sjmbols with the normally developed 
man (see discussion of 'normal' aboie) are, or should be, oc-\alued, 
indefinitelj conditional, not automatic , the meanings, and, therefore, the 
situation as-a-whole, or the context in a given case, become paramount, 
and the reactions should be fully conditional — that is to say, reactions 
of higher order. In human regression or undevelopment, human symbols 
have degenerated to the i alue of signals effective with animals, the main 
difference being in the degree of conditioiialit}’ Absolutism as a seman- 
tic tendency in humans involves, of necessity, one- or few -valued atti- 
tudes, the lack of conditionality, and thus represents a pre-human 
tendency. 

To what extent the language of the degrees of conditionality is help- 
ful in understanding the development of hitman ‘intelligence’, and why 
a fully developed human ‘mind’ should be related with fully conditional 
reactions of higher order, can be well illustrated by an example taken 
quite low in the scale of life. 

This example is selected only because it is simple, and illustrates 
an important principle lery clearly. We know that fishes have a well- 
developed nervous system, do not possess a differentiated cerebral cor- 
tex, but experiments show that they can leain by experience If we 
take a pike (or a perchj and put it in a tank in which some minnows, 
its natural food, are separated from it by a glass partition, the pike 
will dash repeatedly against the glass partition to capture the minnows 
After a number of such dashes it abandons the attempt If we then 
remove the partition, the pike and the minnows will freely sw'im together 
and the pike w ill not attempt to capture the minnows ^ 

The dash for capturing the mmnow’s was a positive and uncondi- 
tional, inborn feeding reaction, unsuited for the environmental con- 
ditions as they happened to be at that moment The (perhaps) painful 
striking of the glass w'as a negatne stimulus, which abolished the posi- 
tive reaction — speaking descriptively — ^and established a negative condi- 
tional reaction, the .result of individual experience, w'hich, as we obser\e 
by the actions of the fish, is not flexible, not adjustable, and quite rigid, 



ON CONDITIONAL REFLEXES 


339 


one-valued, and senu-unconditional, or of low degree of conditionality, 
because, when the glass partition is removed, the pike swims freely 
among the minnows without adjusting itself to the new conditions and 
capturing the minnows 

A cat separated from a mouse by a glass partition also stops dash- 
ing against the glass, but this negative reaction is more conditional In 
‘psychological’ terms, the cat is ‘more intelligent’, evaluates relations bet- 
ter than the fish, and when the glass partition is removed, the cat cap- 
tures the mouse almost immediately 

In this connection, an interesting experiment could be made, though 
I am not aware that it has been performed , namely, to separate the 
above fishes with a wire screen, which would be visible to the fishes, and 
repeat the experiments to test if the removal of a visible obstacle would 
alter the outcome of the experiment or the ‘time’ of the reactions If the 
‘time’ for capturing the minnow s w'ere reduced, this w ould mean that the 
conditionality of the reaction was increased, and so the seeing of the 
obstacle, or the increased power of abstraction, would play some role m 
it Even humans are deceived by Houdinis Are we so ‘superior’ to the 
‘poor fish’ ? 

These problems of degrees of conditionality can also be studied m 
the life of insects, and the works of Professor Wm M Wheeler, for 
instance, furnish most instructive material, which we have not space 
to analyse here ® 

In the process of human evolution from the lowest savage to the 
highest civilized man, it is natural that we should pass through a period 
m which the primitive doctrines and languages must be revised The 
newest achievements m science indicate that the twentieth century may 
be such a period Even m mathematics and physics, to say nothing of 
other disciplines, it is only the other day that the old elementalism and 
two-valued semantics were abandoned Obviously, consciousness of ab- 
stracting produces complete conditionality m our conditional higher 
order reactions, and so must be the foundation on wdiich a science of 
man, or a theory of sanity and human progress, must be built 

The suggested extension of the reaction \ocabulary would allow us, 
at least, to apply a uniform physiological language to life, man tncluded 
We should have a general language for life and all activities, ‘mind’ 
included, of a structure similar to the known protoplasmic and nervous 
structure, not excepting the highest activities ‘Mental’ ills would be 
considered as arrested development or regression to one-, or few-valued 
semantic levels , sanity would be m the other direction , namely, progres- 
sion conditioned by larger and larger flexibility of conditional and seman- 



340 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


tic reactions of higher order, which, tliioiigh cc -valued semantics, would 
help adjustment under the most complex social and economic conditions 
for man The maximum of conditionality would be reached, let us re- 
peat, through the consciousness of abstracting, which is fundamental 
for sanity, and is the main object of the present work, explained in 
Part VII 

It seems that the aggregate of inborn, almost unconditional and 
acquired or conditional reactions of different orders and types constitute 
the foundation of the nervous activities of humans and animals The 
mechanism is not an additive one A little bit of cortex 'added' involves 
most far-reaching differences of behaviour in life; in fact, the number 
of possibilities probably follow the combinations of higher order 

Higher order combinations are constructed from groups which them- 
selves are groups Thus, out of twenty-six letters of the English alpha- 
bet, there are probably trillions of pronounceable combinations of letters 
Sentences are groups of words which are groups of letters, and their 
number, therefore, exceeds enormously the original trillions Books are 
combinations of sentences, and, finally, libraries are combinations of 
books Thus, a library is a combination of fifth order, and the number 
of possible different libraries is inconceivably large As a rule, we pay 
little attention to combinations of higher order, disregarding the fact 
that even materials and the possible variety of them have some such 
structure 

To give an intuitive feel how combinations of higher order increase, 
let me quote Jevons on the simplest case, starting with 2 ‘At the first 
step we have 2 , at the next 2^ or 4 , at the third, 2*“, or 16, numbers of 
very moderate amount Let the reader calculate the next term, 2^^^, and 
he will be surprised to find it leap up to 65,536 But at the next step 
he has to calculate the value of 65,536 two’s multiplied together, and it 
IS so great that we could not possibly compute it, the mere expression of 
the result requiring 19,729 places of figures. But go one step more and 
we pass the bounds of all reason The sixth order of the powers of two 
becomes so great, that we could not even express the number of figures 
required in writing it down, without using about 19,729 figures for the 
purpose ’® 

In actual life, the number of possibilities of higher order combina- 
tions are limited by structural and environmental conditions, never- 
theless, the numbers of possibilities which follow such a rule increase 
surprisingly fast. 



CHAPTER XXTI 


ON ‘INHIBITION’ 


. . . "destructive lesions never cause positive effects, but induce a nega- 
tive cqndition which permits positive symptoms to appear," has become 
one of the hall-marks of English neurology. (212) h head 

Excitation rather than inhibition is important in correlation because 
from what has been said it appears that so far as known inhibition is not 
transmitted as such The existence of inhibitory nervous correlation is of 
course a familiar fact, but in such cases the inhibitory effect is appaiently 
produced, not by transmission of an inhibitory change, but by transmission 
of an excitation and the mechanism of the final inhibitory effect is still 
obscure (92) chahles m child 

But since inhibition is not a static condition but a mode of action, the 
mechanism of the total pattern must be regarded as participating in every 
local reflex (lori G e. cogiiill 

It IS highly probable that excitation and inhibition, the two functions of 
the nerve cell which are so intimately interwoven and which so constantly 
supersede each other, may, fundamentally, represent only different phases 
of one and the same physico-chemical process (394) l p. pavlov 


The term ‘unconditional reflex’ applies only under ‘normal’ or 
‘natural’ conditions, as we know that different drugs, such as ether, 
which alter the conductivity of nervous tissue , can also alter its irri- 
tability. Similarly, with conditional reactions, the introduction of degrees 
of conditionality becomes an important oo-valued structural refinement 
of language, depending on, and introducing explicitly or by implication, 
the number of factors, the degrees of freedom , which are observed 
empirically, and so should have a linguistic and semantic parallel 

If we disregard, for instance, the possibility of the use of a drug , 
then the ‘linconditional’ reactions are largely biconditional The ‘condi- 
tional reflexes’ in animals are a much subtler form of adjustment to many 
more factors, and if we call them ‘conditional of lower orders’ we cover 
structurally their limited conditionality, which with higher animals is 
considerable For example, a fly m the laboratory might disturb the 
reactions, but merely ‘intellectual’ interference would be ineffective 
And, finally, the ‘conditional reactions of higher orders’ m man involve 
still more factors, introduce more and new complexities, and necessitate 
that the human reactions should be fully conditwual, requiring co-valued 
semantics At present, this is an exceptional occurrence, although the 
potentiality for such full conditionality is present in the majority of us. 

The mechanism of the unconditional reaction is, under ordinary 
circumstances, almost automatic It is evolved on the background of

general protoplasmic charactenstics, combined with structural polarity, 
synunetT)'., and is not effiaent enough for the survival of higher 
organisms. 

Under more complex conditions, the adjustment for survis^al must 
be more flexible • a similar direct stimulation must, under different con- 
ditions, result m different reactions, or different stimuli, under other 
conditions, produce similar reactions, resulting, ultimately, not only in 
direct responses to stimuli, but also m the equally important holding in 
abeyance of the reaction, or even the abolishing of it Let us assume 
that the direct response of a cat to a mouse would be clawing and chew- 
ing If that given cat would juat claw and chew when the mouse was 
some distance away, I am afraid such a cat ivould soon starve, for such 
an immediate response would not be a sur\i\al response, and this char- 
acteri-stic could not become hereditary The cats which have survived 
and perpetuated their characteristics are, as a rule, different When they 
see, hear, or smell the mouse at a distance the}’ flatten out. keep still, 
crouch , and get read}, until they are in such a position that a jump will 
procure the victim, and not merely f nghten it aw ay. 

We see that, under more complex conditions, the nen'ous mechan- 
ism must produce not only direct responses to the stimuli but also equally 
important delays and temporal or permanent abolishments of these direct 
responses to stimuli 

Hitherto, we hate analysed the simplest reactions of a positive 
character in which a stimulus produces a direct and obvious response: 
e g , the showing of the food or the ringing of the bell results in an 
excitation in the nervous s}stem and the secretion from the salii-aiy 
glands We are, how'ever, acquainted with another t}’pe of fundamental 
nervous activity of equal importance For instance, m experimenting 
with the positive reactions, we must be careful not to introduce any extra 
stimuli, as any new stimulus immediately excites an investigator}' reac- 
tion, and the alimentary conditional reaction becomes temporarily abol- 
ished From our personal experience, we know a large number of stimuli 
which have some such hindering effect on our respiration, circulation, 
locomotion , w'hich we describe as ‘paral}sed with fear’, ‘speechless with 
rage , ‘struck dumb’, ‘stupefied w ith pain’. The diminution, or deviation, 
or the lack of some function or response on the nervous level is usually 
called ‘inhibition’ 

The term ‘inhibition’ is structurally a profoundly unsatisfactory 
and a misleading ps} cho-logical term, and should be completely aban- 
doned in physiology and neurolog}’, although it could be retained in 
psycho-logics and psychiatry This term is in general use, and the sug-

gestion of abandoning a term in general use is always hard to accept. 
Therefore, it will be well to analyse it in some detail In this case, it 
does not matter if the positive suggestion of a new term or terms is 
structurally acceptable , the analysis of the term ‘inhibition’ shows clearly 
that it has false to fact implications, and so should be rejected m neu- 
rology m any case. 

This term is a favorite word in ecclesiastical and legal literature, 
and means, m the mam, to forbid, to prohibit, to hinder, to restrain It 
IS a psycho-logical term, it implies anthropomorphic ‘free will’ and 
‘authority’ notions perfectly unfit for iteurologtcal use It is not an 
exaggeration to say that the structural implications of this term underlie 
the older animalistic prohibitive and punitive education, legal and eccle- 
siastical tendencies, which, m 1933, are known to be not only in a larger 
sense inoperative, but positively harmful On the human level, this word 
is, perhaps, responsible for the fact that so much about our educational 
and social methods is uncertain and often harmful Education is a 
process of building conditional and j r of different orders If the neuro- 
logical terms dealing with conditional reactions are structurally unsatis- 
factory, our speculations which are earned on in these terms must 
involve these false implications When the empirical results are unsatis- 
factory, as they must be, because of wrong structure of the arguments, 
and a scrutiny of our argumentation shows them to be correctly fol- 
lowing the structural implications of the language used, then we usually 
blame ‘human nature’, which is a very unintelligent excuse, indeed 

The implications of the term ‘inhibition’ become a guidance for our 
conduct, we repress and, in consequence, breed un-samty and maladjust- 
ment On animal level, ‘repression’ is workable, but, on human levels, 
we need a subtler regulative meclianism, in accordance with the structure 
of the human nervous system, and this is found in the fuller condition- 
ality of reactions, based upon consciousness of abstracting, and involving, 
of course, affective components, semantic factors of evaluation which 
regulate human impulses without the animalistic repression In humans, 
the ‘inhibited’, repressed impulses often remain as internal excitatory 
factors, they are not eliminated by some ‘siiperiiatural’ hocus-pocus, but 
remain active, sometimes very active, semantic sources of internal excita- 
tion, resulting in conflicts which generally have pathological results 

We are usually told that ‘inhibition’ plajs an important role m con- 
ditional reactions With the introduction of the degrees of conditionality, 
the importance of the possibility of altering, delaying, or abolishing some 
immediate response becomes much moie accentuated Indeed, it appears 
that this possibility of influencing responses is an important factor m the 



344 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


mechanism of conditionality of lower orders, but becomes the main 
factor in establishing the degrees of conditionality of higher orders. 
Obviously, the reactions become very labile, the adjustment to conditions 
very subtle, allowing the organism to survive under the most complex 
conditions, such as are found in highly ‘civilized’ life 

This mechanism is responsible not only for human intelligence, but 
also for all that is constructive m so-called ‘civilization’. Vice versa, for 
survival in such complex civilization, one must possess these fully con- 
ditional reactions At this point, it will suffice to mention that m organ- 
isms below humans, ‘inhibition’, which underlies the mechanism of 
conditionality of reactions, plays a most important biological and sur- 
vival role, while on the human level it is the foundation on which all 
human jr, ‘intelligence’, and desirable human characteristics are built 
The present theory introduces methods to make the application of the 
above considerations possible in daily life 

All possible analysis depends not only on definitions of terms but 
also on undefined terms, which, outside of mathematics, have seldom, 
if ever, been investigated, thus making the structural assumptions which 
they introduce unconscious In definitions, we also usually posit struc- 
ture, though we seldom realize this fact. When we approach the experi- 
mental side of science, which is the search for empirical structure, the 
implications involved consciously or unconsciously in the defined and 
undefined terms play a very important role, and they direct, to a large 
extent, our efforts and ingenuity This is why we still have so few 
genuinely creative scientists, although since the psycho-logically and 
semantically liberating work of Einstein, the number of creative physi- 
cists of the younger generation has increased surprisingly. Yet the 
majority of scientists do not realize to what extent their sr are influ- 
enced by the terms they use and what enormous help and creative 
freedom they would have from being conscious of the role the structuie 
of language plays 

With this realization, before we begin the constructive analysis of 
such an important term as ‘inhibition’, we must state clearly what the 
general biological presuppositions which underlie such an analysis are 

The present work is a /-7-system, structurally very different from 
the older systems, which attempts to build a verbal system of similar 
structure to the empirical structures, as given by science 1933 The 
older systems had also a structure similar to the very limited knowledge 
of empirical structure which our primitive ancestors had Hence, 
animism, anthropomorphism, ‘psychologism’, and the rest, and the per- 



ON ‘INHIBITION’ 


345 


sistence of such structural features in science as ‘inhibition’ in neurology, 
‘force’ and ‘heat’ m physics , . 

According to scientific standards of 1933, there is, as far as I know, 
only one biological system in existence which can be called modern, and 
this IS the A biology of Professor C M Child (see Chapter VIII) It 
IS, therefore, necessary to accept this system, and also the A neurology 
of Professor Herrick, which is based on this biolog)' 

Generally, the neurologists tell us that the structural aspects of 
‘inhibition’ are unknown To a large extent, this is true, although it is 
quite obvious that a 'psychological’ term cannot shed any light on its 
physiological structure To get glimpses of this mechanism, we must 
start our analysis quite low m the scale of life and see what the most 
general characteristics of protoplasm are 

All protoplasm is irritable In any undifferentiated bit of proto- 
plasm an excitation must (1933) spread in a diminishing gradient, 
establishing, by necessity, a region of highest excitation in contact with 
the stimulus, resulting in a polar orientation, with an eventual future 
head-end, and establishing a physiological gradient, long preceding the 
appearance of any differentiated tissue The nervous s}stem is a later 
outgrowth of such an oriented djnamic field, and its primary morpho- 
logical and physiological characteristics are, to that extent, predeter- 
mined, being, in the meantime, a joint phenomenon of the inherent 
characteristics of protoplasm, its irritability, conductivity, and what not, 
and of its reaction to the environment The physiological gradient is, 
then, the simplest and the most general primary reaction arc in a given 
individual, and constitutes the physiological basis for the structural and 
functional development of all other arcs ^ 

Amoebas are primitive little aquatic animals of approximately 
spherical symmetry which have no differentiated organs at all , yet they 
show quite complex reactions and various adaptive activities to be found 
m higher animals The amoebas can pursue their victim, show prefer- 
ence for stimuli, and move away from the puck of a pin, select then 
food , This fact shows that protoplasm, so little differentiated, and, from 
the organic point of view, undifferentiated, exhibits both muscular as 
well as neural characteristics This fact is fundamental It shoiis that 
m colloids which happen to be sensitn e and which possess a special type 
of conductivity, which, fiom a pin sico-chemical point of view, is only a 
special aspect of one mechanism, there is already present the potentiality 
for any further development Professor Child’s physiological gradients, 
the structural precursors of the nervous system, are a necessity, because 
of the dynamic potentialities of the plenum and the necessary relation 



346 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


to the environment, as there is no such thing as anything without envir- 
onment The stimulus, m the meantime, establishes structurally a func- 
tional polarity as a fundamental charactenstic of all, even most primitive, 
protoplasm, and as the result of the contact of sensitive and conducting 
colloidal structures with the environment * 

In sponges, which have primitive muscular tissue but no nervous 
s) stem, the muscular tissue exhibits also both characteristics, combining 
receptive and motor functions, showing that from the start the supposed 
muscles are, in reality, neuro-motor organs * The actmians have no 
central nervous system By the aid of an incision, we may produce in 
them special additional growths of tentacles sometimes with a mouth, 
sometimes without If, in the last case, ne place a piece of food m the 
tentacles, they will bend toward wheie the mouth should be If we cut 
such a tentacle away from the body, ive still find that in contact with 
food it will bend in the one diiection But here we are dealing not only 
w'lth the sub-microscopic dynamic structure but w'lth macroscopic struc- 
ture, where the irritability and the structure of the peripheral organs 
determine the reaction * 

When w'e expeiiment with animals with a more developed nervous 
system, such as ascidians or w'omis, we come to new and very instructive 
facts Loeb has removed the ganglion from a number of Ciona intes- 
tiiialis, a large transparent ascidian, which normally, when touched at 
the oral or aboial opening, closes the openings, and the whole animal 
contracts into a small ball It appears that a few hours after the operation 
mentioned they relax If a drop of water falls on such an animal, the 
characteristic reaction appears again, showing that the reaction was not 
due to the ganglion but is determined by the structure and arrangement 
of the peripheral parts and the muscles The nerves and the ganglion 
play only the main role as a quicker conductor for the stimulus 

Even in higher animals we find vestiges of such primitive general- 
ized mechanisms For instance, Loeb, m his experiments m removing the 
brain from sharks, found that, even after death and when signs of decom- 
position had already begun, light produced a contraction of the pupils ® 

In a decapitated worm, practically all normal reactions are retained 
If we cut the nervous system of a worm in twm, the two parts of the 
worm move m a co-ordinated way as long as they are connected by a 
little bit of tissue The experiments were carried fuither a worm was 
cut m two completely, the tw'O halves were connected by a string, and 
they still moved in a co-ordinated way, showing once more that originally 
the nervous system w'as a specialization of general protoplasmic charac- 
teristics of irritability and conductivity and structure, which, at present. 



ON ‘INHIBITION 


347 


are known to be strictly interconnected® Multiordinal structure is the 
explanation of this beha'viour Similar examples could be given in great 
numbers, all of which would support the above well-established view. 

Among the general protoplasmic characteristics we do not find 
‘inhibition’, but only positive excitation and conductivity This issue is 
fundamental and should be taken as a foundation for further analysis 
If a wandering amoeba comes to an illuminated spot, the animal 
will not remain in that region Here is, seemingly, a new fact, and we 
must select the language we want to use in this connection If we follow 
the old animism and anthropomorphism, we could say the animal 
‘knows’ , or that some ‘demon’ has forewarned it, or, with equal justi- 
fication, say that it is an example of ‘internal inhibition’ or ‘prohibition’ 
The introduction of such terms, of course, explains nothing physiologi- 
cally, but simply multiplies metaphysical identifications on the uncon- 
scious yet false to fact assumption that a word ‘is’ the thing we are 
talking about — a vestige of the primitive ‘magic of words’ 

Loeb pointed out long ago that to be forced to introduce animism 
and anthropomorphism is enough to neglect the analysis of an extei nal 
stimulus This is true not only m biology, phjsiology, neurology , but 
also in physics The difference between the N and Fl systems depends 
on the fact that Newton did not take into consideration the character of 
the stimulus, the finite velocity of the ray of light, which is fundamental 
in any observation, but that Einstein did take this into consideration 
The oo-valued determinism (the restricted principle of uncertainty) in 
the newer quantum mechanics depends on taking into account the dis- 
turbing effects an ‘observation’ has on the ‘obser\ ed’. 

What are the known facts in the meantime ^ Let us start with the 
character of the stimulus, light We know, positively, that light can be 
considered a very potent stimulus, and so the behaviour of the amoeba 
was a direct response to this stimulus In fact, we know a little about 
this mechanism without introducing any ‘demons’ or ‘internal inhibition’ 
The starfish of a certain species has a sj mmetrical structure consist- 
ing of five arms Its nervous system consists of a central ving around 
the mouth and peripheral nerves radiating from the ring iiitO the arms 
If such an animal is laid upon its back, it will right itself, hut it is essen- 
tial that not all arms should move simultaneously In a normal animal, 
having five arms, usually three arms do the work and two of them 
remain quiet If we destroy the nervous connection between the arms, 
this co-ordination is destroyed, all five aims begin to struggle, and the 
starfish cannot right itself, unless by accident Should we again invoke 
‘demons’ or ‘inhibitions’, or analyse the stimulus-complex and its effect ? 



348 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


Obviously, when the starfish is put on its back, a new stimulus-complex 
IS operating upon it, resulting in a complex adjustment ' 

As we already know, any stimulus applied to a bit of living proto- 
plasm, because of the colloidal structure and of the inherent irritability 
and conductivity of the plenum, produces a ph> siological gradient, 
establishing, thus, some sort of polarity, symmetry, relations, order, and 
structure, and indicating what structure our language should have 
Again, no trace of any ‘inhibition’ or ‘prohibition’ is found, and on the 
silent, un-speakable, objective level everything happens the usual way, 
without any regard to, or respect for, our talking Talking only becomes 
a ver} genuine danger when on language of primitive structure we build 
our creeds, institutions, rules of conduct , and our methods of investiga- 
tion In the last case, our sciences are nearly as slow, halting, perplexing, 
difficult, non-co-ordinated, and, m a larger sense, ineffective, as our 
creeds and institutions have proven to be Our sciences may have added 
to our comfort, but, outside of psychiatry, they have not contributed 
much to human happiness. 

As structure seems so fundamental and can be discovered every- 
where, we should not be surprised to find that in structure, or perhaps, 
still better, in the general structuro-sensitive-conductive dynamic com- 
plex with definite structure on different levels, we shall find the solution 
for obvious positive reactions of organisms, as well as for the lack of 
them 

It is not possible or necessary to go into further details here The 
structural data, ho^vever, although they are not particularly emphasized, 
are given in handbooks of physics, colloidal chemistry, chemistry, bio- 
ph) SICS, biochemistry, biolog}-, physiology, neurology , . At present, it is 
realized in science that structure is of extreme importance , but, because 
of identification, it is not realized that structure is the only possible 
content of science and of all human ‘knowledge’ This fact, of course, 
makes the quest of science uniquely structural. Because of it, we come 
to a very far-reaching general rule, that all ‘understanding’, to be such, 
must exhibit or assume structure, thus formulating the supreme aim, 
and, perhaps, uniquely indicating the only possible method, of science 

Two more simple examples may be helpful Mnemiopsis or 
Eiichans have swimming plates which beat i hythmically, with consid- 
erable regularity When the plates are stimulated mechanically, the 
movement ceases in the presence of sufficient calcium salts in the water 
In similar media, but containing no calcium, a mechanical stimulus does 
not stop the movement of the plates, but just the opposite It accelerates 
their motion, showing clearly that the effect of direct stimulation can

349 


be reversed when the structural relations are altered. Once more, no 
‘demons’ and no ‘inhibition’ ® 

In higher animals, we usually find a well-developed sjmmetry and 
muscles of which the activities oppose the results of the activity of 
other muscles Such muscles are called antagonists If two antagonists 
of equal strength are stimulated equally, no macroscopic effect of the 
stimulation of both muscles results If one of the antagonists is stronger 
than the other, the macroscopic effect of the stimulation of both muscles 
results not in some general convulsion, but in a one-sided action of the 
stronger muscle Obviously, these results are the necessary consequence 
of structure on different levels We had, in the first case, a lack of 
obvious macroscopic reaction, although stimulation was present and did 
its work This was due to structure 

It IS known that some drugs, such as strychnine or the toxin pro- 
duced by the tetanus bacillus, pioduce a state of general and high irii- 
tability of the nervous sjstem The slightest stimulus to the surface 
will produce a spasm which affects practically every muscle of the body. 
The pinching of the foot, instead of producing a withdrawal, results in 
the rigid extension of the legs, arms, and back The extension is no 
longer a co-ordinated process, but is associated with strong contraction 
of the flexors, the final state of the limbs being determined by the sur- 
passing strength of the stimulated extensors The effect of the tetanus 
toxin is similar. In a monkey, under normal conditions, the electrical 
stimulus of a certain spot of the cortex will produce the opening of the 
mouth; similar stimulation of another spot uill produce the closing of 
the jaws But, under the effect of the toxin, the stimulation of any of 
these spots will produce the closure of the jaws, because any attempt to 
open the mouth will excite the stronger masseter muscles and effectively 
close the mouth ® 

The above examples show again that no ‘demon’ or ‘inhibition’ has 
prohibited the withdrawal of the foot or opening of the mouth, but that 
the excitation of stionger antagonists is responsible for the result — or, 
if we wish, for the lack of results All of which is obviously structural 

All the above discussions and examples — and they could be ex- 
panded and extended to fill volumes — show clearly (1) That in the 
structurally more complex organisms the process of co-oidination and 
adjustment to more and more complex environmental conditions, leading 
to wider activities and fuller conditionality of reactions, is partially based 
— ^to the extent of one-half, or even more — on the lack of direct response 
to a stimulus, leading to delayed action and involving the four-dimen- 
sional order, all of this being a function of the entirely general charac- 



350

tenstics of protoplasm , namely, its structure, excitability, and conductinty 
(the last tw o characteristics being also a result of sub-microscopic struc- 
ture) uithout the intervention of ‘demons’ or of ‘inhibition’, (2) that 
in every case there is an excitation, no matter whether the result is a 
positive or a negative reaction, or whether ive can, at present, trace it 
m detail 

As Professor Herrick says ‘On this view of the situation the sup- 
posed inhibitory effect of the cerebral cortex resolves itself into a differ- 
ential dynamogenic cortical influence This is partly specific and phasic, 
acting upon particular subcortical functional systems while these are in 
process and tending to depress all conflicting activities either by with- 
drawing available nervous energy from their apparatus of control or by 
equal activation of agonist and antagonist systems with resulting stasis 
It IS partly a general and tonic activation or reinforcement of all lower 
reflex s) stems Upon removal of the visual cortex the specific phasic 
activation of learned reactions is abolished Upon removal of the entire 
cortex the general tonic cortical effect is abolished The operation has 
not stimulated inhibitory fibers, as some have supposed , it has removed 
the sources of tonic activation which normally are alw'ays operating ’ 

‘The cerebral cortex from its inception exerts more or less inhibi- 
tory influence upon subcortical functions In the simpler learning 
processes of rats there seems to be a differential activation of some key 
factor of a subcortical learning process . . which m effect draws off all 
available cortical energy, leaving other and irrelevant sensori-motor 
processes relatively enfeebled so that they are subordinated The effect 
IS the same as if a specific inhibitory action were exerted by the cortex 
upon the inappropriate movements . It may be suggested, further, that 
all inhibition is in reality a differentiid actuation, the mechanism being m 
some cases simply the “drainage” phenomenon and in other cases this 
effect supplemented by positive actuation of two antagonistic motor 
mechanisms so that their interference blocks all reactions of non-adaptive 
sorts 

In these statements of Professor Herrick, we find a language of 
similar structure to the know n facts The terms of differential dynamo- 
genic cortical indiience and differential activation cover all known facts, 
and may cover future facts, because the terms are structurally very 
flexible, and will always allow us to enlarge our knowledge of the 
mechanism of the so fundamental diffciential activation. 

The difficulty in eliminating the term ‘inhibition’ and suggesting a 
new physiological term to take its place is considerable, because this term 
IS used m many different forms and meanings The term ‘inhibit’ is 



ON ‘INHIBITION’ 


351 


used m its various forms as a substantive, an adjective, a verb, an 
adverb, sometimes as a psycho-logical term, sometimes as a physiological 
one, yet never carrying physiological implications, but ahiajs psjcho- 
logical and anthropomorphic ones connected with its origin and standard 
use. It was introduced into science when physiology and neurology were 
in their infancy, and so were still under the influence of primitii e ani- 
mism and anthropomorphism 

The term, because of its character, is not scientifically descriptive 
It does not suggest functional, actional, directional, or other structural 
implications, but suggests notions irrelei ant to science connected with its 
origin and standard use, making it a far-fetched inferential term, the 
use of which must retard the advances of these sciences 

Once we introduce a phj siological term with physiological and, 
therefore, structural implications, our expressions will have to be re- 
shaped to make the use of the term possible Such re-w'ording will 
always carry quite definite structural implications, which, m turn, sug- 
gest further experiments in the search for structure and so have a 
creative character, not to be disregarded Thus, as we have already seen, 
the term of ‘degrees of conditionality’ suggested further experiments 
and the revision of older data 

This statement is quite general and may be summed up as follows • 
The introduction of a new structural term may (1) eliminate the 
improper implications of the older terms, (2) introduce new and cre- 
ative implications which suggest the need of verification and so lead to 
new experiments 

At this point, I suggest a term which may be useful and will, per- 
haps, be acceptable for scientific use As the fundamental character of 
‘inhibition’ seems to be ‘differential activation’, the term to be coined 
should possess two main structural implications (1) it should be direc- 
tional, or indicate the sense of the reaction, and (2) it should imply 
activation 

We find such a term in ‘negative excitation', ‘negative stimulation’, 
‘negative activation’, ‘negative phase’ , and it is possible to extend the use 
of this term by making as many compound terms as we need 

If possible, we should have terms which help us to keep on one 
level of analysis, and so automatically prevent us from confusing levels, 
since modern science always deals, at least m principle, with not less 
than three levels, the macroscopic, the microscopic, and the sub-micro- 
scopic, thus making confusion quite easy If we call the positive effect 
of a stimulation on the macroscopic level ‘positive’, any other stimulation 
which might fail to produce the positive effect on this level, or which 



352 


VI. ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


might counteract it, would be negative The implication would remain 
that there was some excitation, but tliat it did not produce the effect 
\\ hich we had called positu e. Structurally, such a term would be satis- 
factory, especially as it would help us to keep on one level of analysis 
and not confuse the mam levels through verbal structure 

Such a language would help us to study the mechanism of ‘differ- 
ential activation’, and would carry helpful implications If any cases 
appeared m which this term did not cover the field, either the term could' 
be enlarged, keeping the implications, or the statements should be altered 
so as to be expressible by such terms The last would always prove to 
carry interesting implications, suggesting experiments. 

In the processes going on m the nervous system, there is no occa- 
sion for the application of terms like ‘prohibition’ or ‘inhibition’ There 
IS no standstill m these sub-microscopic processes, though the manifesta- 
tion on the macroscopic levels can be either of a positive or of a negative 
character On the sub-microscopic levels, there is a nervous excitation 
whicli often stimulates antagonistic processes , with results which are 
not always obvious 

The implication of the term ‘negative excitation’, although limited, 
IS structurally correct m 1933 Without going into full detail here, I 
merely suggest a few considerations First of all, the term preserves its 
mam implication ; namely, that of excitation, ‘negative’ suggesting that 
this excitation takes an opposite course to the positive one If, for in- 
stance, a positive excitation produces, let us say, the activities of the 
salivary glands, a negative excitation in this respect will not produce 
them but will produce other activities, such as, for instance, an invei. ga- 
tory reaction With a negative excitation, there is an excitation, but it 
produces different results There is no possibility of stopping or pro- 
hibiting or inhibiting nervous activities, short of death as-a-whoie or 
destruction m parts , but only a possible deviation of activities, owing to 
enormous possibilities m establishing nervous connections, endlessly 
subtle dynamogenic effects , . 

In some instances, ‘inhibition’ might be regarded as a form of 
nervous exhaustion; but such a notion cannot always be structurally 
correct, as there is much evidence at hand that ‘inhibition’ spreads to 
other cortical elements whieh were not functionally exhausted, or that 
It can be counteracted by some new excitation. ‘Inhibition’ thus pre- 
serves its active character The origin of ‘inhibition’ is also very instinc- 
tive, and a mass of experimental data shows that it can be produced 
experimentally. Among other ways, it can be produced by very weak, 
very strong, or unusual stimuli, but stimuli, anyway As a rule, any

353 


extra nervous excitation m the central nervous system manifests itself 
at once, either in diminishing, or in completely abolishing (temporarily, 
at least) the conditional reflexes prevailing at the date If we find that 
exhaustion is, in some instances, the structurally correct term, there is 
no reason why we should not use it, instead of using a psycho-logical 
term of ‘inhibition’, on neurological levels 

That the terminology of positive and negative excitation is struc- 
turally appropriate finds its further support in the so-called ‘disinhibi- 
tion’ Thus, an ‘inhibition’ of an ‘inhibition’ reverses the neural process 
prevailing at a given ‘time’ and becomes a positive excitatory one. In 
our language, because of structural considerations, we should say that 
‘disinhibition’ should be labelled as ‘negative excitation of second degree', 
resulting in a positive excitation If we were to ‘inhibit’ ‘dismhibition’, 
we should have, again, ‘inhibition’. With the new terminology, it would 
be a negative excitation of the third degree, which would give negative 
results, and a general rule could be established, in complete accordance 
with the mathematical language in which the even degrees of a negative 
excitation would have positive characteristics and the uneven would 
remain negative (‘inhibitory’) 

Such a language would not just borrow ‘by analogy’ some mathe- 
matical features Once we take structure into consideration, — and lin- 
guistic issues represent an adjustment of structure — when a systematic 
analogy is found, it has always structural implications which should be 
used for testing structure There can be no serious objection to the 
statement that mathematics is, at present, a limited language of which 
the structure in 1933 is similar, or the most similar we have, to the 
known structure of the world and our nervous sj'stem The use of 
'uch language must be always desirable, as it is a test of structure and 
so leads to further discoveries of the unknown structure of this world. 
To the best of my knowledge, the above is a novel, very general, struc- 
tural use of mathematics considered as a prototype of languages Our 
emphasis is now on the stiucture of mathematics, and not on the numeri- 
cal solutions of equations, the possibility and usefulness of which is 
precisely due to the fact that equations express relatedness, and so 
necessarily give us structural glimpses 

From a structural and linguistic point of view, the historical devel- 
opment of mathematics shows that it is a first successful attempt to 
develop a language with a structure similar to the empirical structures, 
and shows the ideal conditions of producing languages 

When we had only positive numbers, we could add two and three 
and make five, we could subtract two from three and have the remainder 
23 



354

one, but we could not subtract three from two Yet the structure of 
this world is such that a further development m the structure of the 
language was imperative Thus, if an object moves m a given direction 
with the velocity two feet per second, and some external factor imparts 
to it a velocity of three feet per second m the opposite direction, the 
original direction of motion will be reversed, and the object will move 
with the velocity of one foot per second in the opposite direction Or, 
to give another example, some one has two units of money and he buys 
something which costs three units of money He is then m debt one unit 

Such facts necessitated the introduction of negative numbers and 
so made subtraction always possible If the motion m one direction or 
the amount of money in our pocket was called 'phis two’ units, and we 
subtract from it three units, the results were ‘minus one’, meaning a 
conventional reversal of direction, or sense, for motion, or a debt, 
instead of a possession, for money. 

Experimental facts of division again necessitated the expansion of 
this language Thus, fractions were introduced so as always to allow 
of linguistic division. The ‘imaginary’ number, i= y / — 1, was intro- 
duced to allow, in all cases, the extraction of roots , For a long ‘time’, the 
number % = V — 1 was considered almost mystical, but, of late, when 
a physicist or an engineer finds it in his equations, it is almost an un- 
mistakable indication for him to look for some wave-motion in the world 
More extended observation of the empirical world and structure required 
further structural adjustment of our languages 

In the vector calculus we have the so-called scalar product which 
obeys the ordinary laws of multiplication and ab = ba where the order 
of the factors is of no importance The vector product does not follow 
these rules, as the order becomes important, thus, m a vector product, 
ab = — b a In the newer quantum mechanics, to account structurally 
for the experiments, still newer numbers were introduced Instead of 
the old arithmetical qp = pq or qp — pq = 0, we introduce new numbers 

where qp — pq=‘ 1 

2ir 

It IS very significant that a similar linguistic evolution appears jus- 
tifiable m the case of the function of the nervous system in general and 
in the structure and function of the conditional reactions in particular 
As experience and theory show, the fundamental structures and func- 
tions we find in life are not ‘plus’ affairs, but represent some higher- 
degree functions of a non-additive character. The typical functioning 
of the human nervous system (time-bmding) is represented by an ex- 
ponential function of ‘time’.“ Now we see that the reversal of the sign

of negative excitation also follows exponential rules, and experiments 
show that the change in order of abstractions whicli, by necessity, must 
be passing from even to uneven numbers of orders or vice versa, also 
reverses the sign of the reaction (see Part VII). 

In the case of positive excitation, there is also a structural parallel 
with the newer languages of mathematics, but we do not need to analyse 
it here, because the foundation of the more flexible, adjustable responses 
begins with a negative effect, and, in this case, the language I suggest 
IS fully justified without further explanations The neurological im- 
portance of ‘consciousness of abstracting’ is based precisely on the fact 
that it automatically involves a fraction of a second of psycho-logical 
delay, and thus is fundamentally based on, and introduces m training, 
a wholesome ‘inhibition’. 

We come thus to a weighty structural conclusion that the funda- 
mental processes of the nervous system are not only non-plus processes 
but that they follow the exponential rules of signs. As soon as we 
realize that from a structural point of view ‘structure’ and ‘function’ 
are only different types of language in which to speak about two aspects 
of what is going on, on the silent un-speakable level, and that on this 
level these two aspects can never be divided, we must also build a non-el 
language. Such a language is found in dynamic structure, out of which 
arises function, and even macroscopically relatively enduring structures 
as special aspects, and the exponential character of the fundamental 
activities of the nervous system becomes a necessity 

In modern mathematics numbers can be interpreted as operators , 
which, m our case, suggests great freedom of structuial use, and widens 
the application of these notions 

To put the problems as simply as possible all the more subtle forms 
of adjustment m organisms, ‘intelligence’, so-called 'civilization', our 
‘ethics’, ‘happiness’ , and, finally, sanity, which is the evidence of seman- 
tic adjustment or proper evaluation on human levels, are based on the 
neurological interplay, the number, and multi-dimensional order of 
superimposed (not added) positive and negative excitations The posi- 
tive, or the direct and obvious, responses are the more primitive; the 
negative, resulting m not always obvious consequences, are the result of 
further structural complexities, which reach their culmination m the 
normally developed highly cultured man 

Such indefinitely superimposed negative excitations are found 
physiologically in the hierarchy of higher and higher orders of abstrac- 
tions, which are able to leverse the sign of the sr, and so, structurally, 
make these considerations extremely workable and neurologically sound. 



356 


VI. ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


and justify their introduction and use This accounts for the fact that 
what was evaluated as tragic or painful, or joyful, or shameful , to one 
generation or culture, does not seem so to another. Our personal dif- 
ficulty usually IS that, at present, we copy animals in the relative un- 
conditionality of our responses, because we are not acquainted with this 
semantic mechanism We are not prepared to change in one single 
generation the sign from a minus to a plus, or vice versa, without a 
great amount of struggle and semantic discomfort 

Now, such discomforts are usually harmful to the human nervous 
system, but the structural understanding of this mechanism helps us to 
eliminate these semantic pains, and so leads toward nervous balance 
and sanity. 

It seems that the neurological mechanism operating in this connec- 
tion IS similar to the one formulated by Pavlov, thus: ‘Two facts relat- 
ing to the central nervous activities stand out clearly. The first is that 
the extraneous stimulus acting on the positive phase of the reflex 
inhibits, and acting on the negative phase dis-inhibits, in either case, 
therefore, reversing the nervous process prevailing at the time. The 
second is that the inhibitory process is more labile and more easily 
affected than the excitatory process, being influenced by stimuli of 
much weaker physiological strength 

Negative reactions or ‘inhibition’ must be interpreted as the neuro- 
logical foundation of ‘human mentality’, and the result of external and 
internal stimulations. Because of structural interrelations, the mam fac- 
tor of building human ‘mentality’ and developing internal ‘inhibition’ 
must be more labile and must be influenced by stimuli of much weaker 
physiological strength. 

This explains also why the solution of our problems in education, 
social life , must be not the animalistic external ‘inhibition’ alone, but 
must become, m the mam, special internal ‘inhibition’, effective and yet 
harmless to the induidual nervous system. All of us possess this most 
general nervous mechanism The problem is to discover the means to 
operate it. We shall see later that in consciousness of abstracting we 
find a workable semantic solution, allowing an automatic change of sign 
of the reaction It should be recalled here that all stimuli and all 
responses are complex, the word ‘simple’ being structurally false to facts 
On the human, and particularly on the linguistic level, it is practically 
never possible to ascertain an ‘absolute’ order of abstraction, or the 
degree or order of an excitation These are often the results of racial 
time-bmding, and extremely complex, nervous processes, and every 
superimposition of a new neurological process (not addition) may fun-

damentally alter the whole character of the s r and reverse the sign In 
negative excitations, the passing from one degree to another changes the 
sign of the reaction. In practice, we are only interested in two neigh- 
bouring levels of abstractions or in two neighbouring degrees of negative 
excitation, simply because these involve, by necessity, a passing from 
an even to an uneven degree or vice versa — in both cases reversing the 
sign of the s.r. 

The general organismal adjusting mechanism of the ‘investigatory 
reaction’ responds positively to a new stimulus, but with very important 
survival value acts negatively on established positive conditional reactions 
in animals It is, at present, much weakened and often ineifective with 
man, resulting in non-survival, non-adjustment and ‘mental’ ills for 
man It is a well-established fact that different stimuli either interfere 
with each other, resulting in modified behaviour, or reinforce each other 
and have cumulative effects On the human level, different ‘mental’ 
factors play the role of internal positive or negative excitatory semantic 
complexes, which, because of verbal conditions (and all doctrines are 
always connected with an affective background), may reinforce a given 
stimulus, thus making its physiological effect variable and of different 
strength Under such conditions a new stimulus does not produce the 
investigatory reaction with all its beneficial results This mechanism 
IS, perhaps, responsible for the well-known fact that primary instincts 
with humans are, by far, weaker and more variable than with animals , 
whence it comes that humans seldom know by themselves, without 
science, what ts best for them 

We should not be surprised to find that under these more complex 
conditions human investigatory reactions may be of different types, 
culminating m the typically huinaii investigatory reaction, which would 
introduce the natural, yet more important, delay in an ‘immediate reaction 
to a former stimulus We shall find, later, that consciousness of abstract- 
ing IS such a distinctly human and very useful investigatory reaction 
that on the human complex semantic level brings relatively as much 
benefit to the human organism as it does on the animal level to animals 

It seems that the nervous mechanisms of both types are similar, 
except for the fact that on the human levels we have more factors 
which are external and internal stimuli than on the animal level If we 
copy animals in our nervous processes, we are, in reality, Morse off 
than the animals, because, with our more complicated nervous system, 
it means for us a pathological condition. 



CHAPTER XXIII 


ON CONDITIONAL REACTIONS OF HIGHER ORDERS AND 
PSYCHIATRY 

In the dog two conditions were found to produce pathological distur- 
bances by functional interference, namely, an unusually acute clashing of 
the excitatory and inhibitory processes, and the influence of strong and 
extraordinary stimuli. In man precisely similar conditions constitute the 
usual causes of nervous and psj’chic disturbances i394) i p pavlov 

The fact that the maximum disturbance in the central nervous activity 
does not appear immediately on administration of the causative stimulus, 
but after one or more days has been observed in many animals (394) 

I. P PAVLOV 


Psychiatrists will readily understand the structurally false to facts 
and harmful implications of the term ‘inhibition’ on the neurological 
level, when they consider that often ‘pain’, ‘fright', and different ‘prohi- 
bitions’ and ‘inhibitions’ on the psycho-logical level result in nervous 
processes which are not passive, eliminated factors, but remain what they 
w ere originally — exciting semantic factors ‘repressed’ on human levels — 
and become very active and potent causative factors in many ‘mental’ 
and phjsical ailments 

If the non-el point of view and language are seriously applied, there 
seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the future physician, on 
perfectly scientific, structural, physico-chemical, and colloidal grounds, 
will never attempt to dnide the ‘physical’ from the ‘mental’, and different 
nervous processes now called ‘inhibition’ will come prominently to the 
fore as active, to be taken care of and never to be disregarded 

That the mechanism of conditional reactions in animals bears an 
astonishing resemblance to the mechanism of ‘mental’ ills in humans, 
because of the relative unconditionality of both, is exemplified practically 
throughout the whole work of Pavlov, although he did not point out this 
particular connection As soon as this is understood, we shall find that 
some of the experiments of Doctor Zavadzki, made in Pavlov’s labora- 
tory tzoenty-five years ago, disclose a neurological mechanism i\hich 
underlies practically all ps) chotlierapy, and which, therefore, appears 
very important and to deserve special discussion 

I do not know the percentage of the successful application of psy- 
chotherapy of any scientific school, or of extra-medical cults, because 
the many cases of failure are very seldom recorded We usually forget, 
or do not realize, that the successful cases teach us, structurally, less 
than the failures, because there is always an infinity of ways in which 
we can account for a positive result, which is structurally entirely invali- 

358 



CONDITIONAL REACTIONS AND PSYCHIATRY 359 


dated as such by a single failure, if the possibility of it is not foreseen 
by the structural flexibility of the general method 

From what I gather (though I may be mistaken) of every hundred 
patients who seek relief in psychotherapy, fifty fail completely The 
remaining fifty can, perhaps, be divided into two groups , the first one 
of, say, ten, who become entirely relieved, the other remaining forty, 
who improve in different degrees The analysis in the present work 
may, perhaps, explain why the percentage of failures is so high It seems 
that no school of psychotherapists has analysed ‘mental’ ills from the 
general non-el structural and semantic point of view , and, although the 
physicians struggle in every case to abolish the relative unconditionality 
of the reactions, their methods are neither neurological, nor physiological, 
nor fundamental enough 

The language used in these scientific theories includes such terms 
as ‘conscious’, ‘unconscious’, ‘repression’, ‘inhibition’, ‘transfer’, ‘com- 
plex’, There seems no doubt that some such terms cover a few of the 
facts we know from experience and observation, and that they may be 
structurally correct on the psycho-logical level The nervous mechanism 
involved, although discovered tv\enty-five years ago, has not generally 
attracted the attention of physicians, and the postulated theories, lacking 
neurological foundations, are often called ‘far-fetched speculations’, a 
fact which IS ultimately harmful to the whole psychotherapeutic and 
semantic hygiene movement 

The ‘psychologists’ and the psychiatrists are very much divided as 
to the role ‘introspection’ plays This is due to the confusion of the 
orders of abstractions Animals may ‘feel’, may ‘suffer’, but they cannot 
describe Humans differ in this respect, the given person may feel pain, 
the pain is very objective to the given individual, and it is not zvords 
(objective level), but we can describe it, this description being valid on 
the descriptive level, a higher order abstraction than the objective level 
(which is un-speakable for the given individual) If we asoibe this 
process to others, this is no longer a description but an inference, or a 
still higher order abstraction, which statements have to be verified by 
averaging Scientifically (1933), psj cho-logics are impossible without 
the description of internal processes, and, therefore, some ‘introspection’, 
so that the United States Behaviourism becomes a very naue discipline 
The Behaviourists mean well, methodologically, ivithout realizing fully 
what scientific methodology is They completely condemn ‘introspection’, 
yet they continually use it Consciousness of abstracting solves the rid- 
dles of pro- or anti-behaviouristic attitudes, because, when we are fully 



360 


VI. ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


conscious of abstracting', w e should never confuse description with infer- 
ence, neurologically processes of different order 

Any discipline, to be a ‘science’, must start with the lowest abstrac- 
tions available , iihich means descriptions of some objective, unspeakable 
level In hitman psycho-logics, ‘introsiiection’ is the only possible descrip- 
tive level, all other methods being inferential 

The experiments of Doctor Zaiadzki were conducted to investigate 
the mechanism of the so-called ‘dela>ed reflexes’ Speaking roughly, m 
experiments m which the interval between the conditional stimulus and 
the reinforcement by food or acid is short, saj , one to fi\ e seconds, the 
salivary secretion follows nearh immediatel) after the application of the 
conditional stimulus If the delay between the two is longer, say, several 
minutes, the appearance of sain ary secretions is also delayed, the length 
of this delay being proportional to the length of the inteiwal between 
the two stimuli 

In these experiments there were two phases’ the one in which the 
conditional stimulus has apparently no effect, the other in which the 
conditional stimulus becomes effective The investigation was continued 
to discover what becomes of the excitation due to the conditional stimu- 
lus during its ajiparent inactivity 

New experiments finallj disclosed an astonishing mechanism A 
tactile stimulation was used for three minutes as a conditional stimulus 
for acid, and reinforced, as usual, by the application of acid, and a 
stable, delayed conditional reaction was obtained But w’hen a perfectly 
neutral stimulus, say, the sound of a metronome or a noiselessly rotating 
object, never connected W’lth any alimentary stimulation, was superim- 
posed upon the original conditional stimulus, immediately a copious 
secretion of sain a, together with the motor reactions peculiar to a gnen 
stimulus, were obtained 

We see that the excitatory process in the nervous system existed all 
the time m a concealed, non-nianifest form and was released by an extra 
and neutral stimulus ^ 

Similar experiments show clearly that the structure and function 
of the central nervous system is such that some stimulations can be 
concealed and become macroscopically seemingly inactive, giving no 
obvious manifestation or response, yet preserving their active exciting 
characteristics which, by proper treatment, can be released at will In 
ph}sics, we have a similar phenomenon in the case of ‘frozen’ light, 
galvanic and storage batteries, pear-shaped drops of glass resulting from 
melting, which explode when the end is broken off, and many others, 
although probably the sub-microscopic mechanisms are different 



CONDITIONAL REACTIONS AND PSYCHIATRY 361 


It does not take much explanation to see that the nervous mechan- 
ism revealed m the experiments of Doctor Zavadzki accounts on human 
levels for a great many 'mental’ manifestations, including ‘recall’, ‘un- 
conscious’, ‘repression’, ‘complexes’ , and allowing a further generaliza- 
tion, that a slight nervous disturbance of ‘recall’, in the sense of negative 
unconditionality, may be closely connected with a pathological semantic 
‘complex’ 

Another experiment has close connection with the problems of the 
human ‘unconscious’, ‘repressions’, and ‘complexes’ The positive con- 
ditional reactions were usually obtained by combining under certain 
conditions a formerly neutral stimulus with food or with a mild defense 
reaction to acid. If the neutral stimulus is not reinforced, it loses its 
significance for the organism, no secretion is obtained, and it becomes 
from this point of view a negative stimulus If, with a given animal, a 
negative reaction is established, it can, under certain conditions, be 
transformed into a positive one by reinforcement In the experiment 
we are describing, a dog was used, with a well-established negative 
alimentary reaction to the beats of the metronome at the late of sixty 
beats per minute, while the rate of one hundred and twenty beats per 
minute was used as a positive stimulus Both reactions were constant and 
precise The process of transformation from negative to positive went 
slowly, after the seventeenth application with reinforcement, a small 
secretion of saliva was obtained , after the twenty-seventh reinforcement, 
the secretions of saliva were already considerable. No definite disturb- 
ances m other positive reactions w'ere observed except for a tendency to 
the equalization of strong and weak conditional stimuli 

But the secretory reaction to the transformed stimulus of sixty beats 
did not remain constant, in spite of reinforcement, it diminished, and 
after the thirtieth application fell to zero It was noticed, further, that 
immediately after the application of the metronome at the rate of sixty 
beats per minute, practically all the older positive reactions disappeared 
After further experimenting, some of the positive effects of the metro- 
nome at sixty returned, but its negative or depressing effect on the posi- 
tive reactions persisted In all cases where the metionome at sixty was 
not used, all the positive conditional reactions maintained their strength, 
except that the weaker stimuli had an inclination to produce lesser effects 
toward the end of the experiment Although the metronome at sixty or 
one hundred and twenty produced salivary secretions in varying quanti- 
ties when used alone, whenever the metronome was used there fol- 
lowed a disturbance of all conditional reactions, varying from complete 
extinction to a diminution of secretions. The formerly positive stimulus 



362 


VI ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


of one hundred and twenty beats of the metronome produced greater dis- 
turbances than the formerly negative of sixty Further experimentation 
disclosed that the disturbance of the cortex was profound, and that it 
could not w ithstand any kind of stronger stimuli without producing com- 
pletely negatne results It became, also, obvious that the maximum 
disturbance in the central nervous actnitj in animals (and in man) does 
not appear immediately after the application of the injurious factor but 
after a delay. 

Since other auditory stimuli acted during these experiments, Pavlov 
concludes that ‘the disturbance must be regarded as a result of a strictly 
localized functional interference in the acoustic analyser, a chronic func- 
tional lesion of some circumscribed part, the stimulation of which pro- 
duces an immediate effect upon the function of the whole cortex, and 
finally leads to a protracted pathological state’, and, that ‘it is obvious 
that the localized disturbance of the acoustic analyser is again the result 
of a clash between excitation and inhibition’, which this particular 
ner\ ous system finds difficult to adjust ® 

These experiments were conducted upon a dog which had seiwed 
in the laboratory for a long time and belonged to the tj'pe which has a 
very negati\ely excitable nen-ous sjstem Experiments on dogs with 
very positivelj excitable nervous systems, although different m details, 
led to similar general results, namclj, that a clashing of the tAvo 
antagonistic ner\ous processes led, usually, to a more or less protracted 
disturbance of the function of the cortex, in the form of a lasting 
predominance of one of the processes ® 

Experimenting on the conditional reactions in animals, such as a 
dog, by inducing pathological states of the nerA ous system, gives us, in a 
simplified form, a means to understand the mechanism Avhich underlies 
some of the human ‘mental’ illnesses, provided Ave realize the funda- 
I mental fact that these experiments on dogs correspond, in their simpler 
form, to ‘mental’ ills, and not to ‘mental’ health, in man The above 
experiments would be impossible Avith a healthy person , yet they depict 
exactly A\hat happens in the case of ‘mentally’ ill The experiments 
started Avith a healthy animal, and they ended AVith a pathological case 
If similar experiments Avere undertaken Avith a healthy person, no patho- 
logical results would folloAV, OAving to the larger conditionality of re- 
actions , but similar pathological results are produced in humans by 
different means, the confusion of orders of abstractions being a standard 
semantic mechanism to bring about the ‘clash’ between the positive and 
negative excitations w'hich the nervous system of man cannot resolve 
so easily 



CONDITIONAL REACTIONS AND PSYCHIATRY 363 


The experiments of Pavlov disclose, also, a fact which, on human 
levels, introduces serious complications , namely, that some animals have 
highly excitable nervous systems, and that some have less excitable ones. 
Experiments conducted on some individuals produce one effect, similar 
experiments performed on individuals with different nervous systems 
produce different results In some instances, the nervous systems are 
so sturdy that no disturbances appear at all 

To anticipate a little it appears that under the present linguistic, 
educational, social, economic , conditions, nearly all of us suffer from 
nervous and semantic disturbances, produced by copying animals in our 
nervous responses This last condition occurs because the larger con- 
ditionality of human responses has not been taken into consideration; 
its mechanism is unknown, and we do our best to teach and enforce the 
animalistic responses As yet, we have had no physiological and simple 
methods by which to tram in this larger conditionality This is a simple 
explanation of our failure Only a few of us have such sturdy nervous 
systems that they do not become semantically disturbed m any marked 
degree, and these are exceptions Obviously, even an attempt to build a 
general theory dealing with these semantic problems may be useful, 
for the very mistakes made may serve others as an incentive for further 
enquiries m a field which is practically unexplored and extremely large. 

In the formulation of the present general theory, theoretical con- 
siderations suggested necessary neurological mechanisms , yet the 
standard books on physiology and neurology did not give enough data 
In the recent work of Pavlov, I found sufficient experiments and data 
to illustrate the neurological mechanisms which underlie the present 
theory It seems likely that the work of Pavlov and the experiments 
described, together with the theoretical issues raised in the present sys- 
tem, will be of value to psycho-logicians and psychiatrists, provided 
that they pay attention to the semantic non-confusion of orders of 
abstractions, without u Inch it is practically impossible to translate experi- 
ments dealing with nervous responses of animals to the human le\ els and 
escape verbal fallacies The language of the structure, as introduced m 
the present work, is essential in this respect , in fact, the present writer 
could not have carried out his analysis without it 

Pavlov also suggests some applications to human pathological cases 
which are recognized as such, the average person being assumed ‘normal’ 
The present work is an independent theoretical enquiry, and the results 
are much more general, as they show that the general neurological 
mechanism allows an almost universal misuse of our nervous systems, 
because of the disregard of structural, linguistic, and semantic issues 



364 


VI. ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY 


In several chapters, Pavlov discusses a large number of experiments 
dealing with functionally induced pathological states of the nenmus 
system, and suggests. al.'O, some therapeutic measures. lie concludes* 
‘This . . and other observations suggest that a gradual development of 
internal inhibition in the cortex should be used for re-establishmentof the 
balance of normal conditions in cases of an unbalanced nervous system 
. I do not know whether similar therapeutic measures . . are applied 
in human neurotherapy ’* 

The above remark is vitally important , it is not only a result of a 
lifetime of scientific work, but it expresses a principle which is used, 
without being formulated explicitly, all through psychotherapy In the 
present volume, this principle is not only formulated in physiological 
terms, but is also made the foundation of a physiological method for its 
semantic application This method is found in the training and develop- 
ment of the consciousness of abstracting ("see Part \TI), which, when 
applied, not onij’ restores nervous balance as empirically shown, but also 
gives powerful preventive semantic means if used in early education 

Further consequences and conclusions are given in Part ^^I At this 
point, vv e shall merely state that the above explanations also show why a 
theory of universal agreement, in the broadest sense; namely, agreement 
with one’s self, eliminating internal 'conflict’, and with others, eliminat- 
ing family, social, and international conflicts is neurologically not only 
possible, but also a necessary semantic consequence of using the human 
nervous S3 Stem in its structurallj' appropriate way 

It IS well known that the use of the terms ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ 
is optional , but the opposing character of the issues involved is not 
optional, because these are experimental and structural In former dav's, 
we not only made our selection, and called some issues positiv'e and some 
negative, but we naturally had and have some semantic responses con- 
nected vv ith them Thus something ‘positive' implied certainty, ‘reality’, 
‘truth’, ‘absolute’ , something ‘negative’ implied the negation of these. 

In 1933. it appears likely that w'e shall have to revise in toto these 
semantic orientations, which obvuously we hav e been practicing since the 
days of savagery

2) The numbers which are the foundation of the most important

numbers. 



CONDITIONAL REACTIONS AND PSYCHIATRY 365 


3) The foundation of so-called ‘human mentality’ is the ‘negative’ 
reaction 

4) Because words are never the things we speak about, the sole 
link between languages and the objective world being structural, the only 
‘positive’ facts about this world are of the old ‘negative’ character 

5) Finally, the mam difficulty of the -system can be found m the 
positive ‘is’ of identity, involving us in false to fact evaluation and 
semantic disturbances, on the other hand, a ^-system is based on the 
complete elimination of identity formulated as a negative premise of the 
‘this ts not this’ type (see Part VII). 

Atr present, only in techmcal mathematics can people behave seman- 
tically like ‘gentlemen’ They analyse and agree , no quarrels are possible 
Linguistic and semantic researches show that the structure of all lan- 
guages can, and must, be made similar to empirical structures , and then, 
also, the rest of humans can, and probably will, behave in a less silly and 
futile way than they have done in the past and are doing in the present

Of all men, Aristotle is the one of whom his followers have worshipped 
his defects as well as his excellencies which is what he himself never did 
to any man living or dead, indeed, he has been accused of the contrary 
fault (354) AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN 

There is one very mportant fact on which we must be in no doubt, and 
that IS that for any given deductive theory there is not any one system 
of fundamental notions nor any one system of fundamental propositions; 
there are generally several equally possible, t e from which it is equally 
possible to deduce correctly all the theorems . This fact is very 
important, because it shows that there are in themselves no tindefinable 
notions nor indemonstrable propositions, they are only so relatively to a cer- 
tain adopted order, and they cease fat any rate partly) to be such if another 
order is adopted This destroys the traditional conception of fundamental 
ideas an fundamental truths, fundamental, that is to say, absolutely and 
essentially ( 12 (b louis couturat 

In this direction finality is not sought, for it is apparently unattainable

This long discussion brings us to the final conclusion that the concrete 
facts of nature are events exhibiting a certain structure in their mutual 
relations and certain characters of their own The aim of science is to ex- 
press the relations between their characters in terms of the mutual struc- 
tural relations between the events thus characterised (573)

Neither the authority of man alone nor the authority of fact alone is

This tides over his immediate difficulty, but he cannot make serious prog- 
ress with word-building so long as Archers, Butchers, Captains, dance 
round the letters. The letters are abstract, and sooner or later he has to 
realise it In physics we have outgrown archer and apple-pie definitions 
of the fundamental symbols To a request to explain what an electron

use of psychoanalysis we are dealing solely with a method for gaming data 
One occasionally hears the statement that psychoanalysis is nonsense A 
method, or a tool, is not nonsense (24i) smith ely jelliffe 

It IS by means of internal inhibition that the signalizing activity of the

We are dealing here with types of associative reaction peculiar to the 
cortical system, correctly opposed to the unqualified affective reactivity 
of the thalamus and usefully analysed by Head (4ii) henri piUron

of internal inhibition in the cortex should be used for re-establish ment of

Aristotle, in building his theories, had at his disposal, besides his 
personal gifts, a good education according to his day and the science 
current in 400-300 b c Even m those days, the Greek language was a 
very elaborate affair Aristotle and his followers simply took this lan- 
guage for granted The problems of the structure of language and its 
effect on j r had not yet arisen To them, the language they used was 
the (unique) language When I use the expression ‘the language’, I do 
not mean anything connected with the language, as Greek j I mean only 
the structure of it, which was much similar in the other national lan- 
guages of this group The language Aristotle inherited was of great 
antiquity, and originated m periods w'hen knowledge was still more 
scanty Being a keen observer, and scientifically and methodologically 
inclined, he took this language for granted and systematized the modes 
of speaking This systematization was called ‘logic’ The primitive 
structural metaphysics underlying this inherited language, and expressed 
in its structure, became also the ‘philosophical’ background of this sys- 
tem. The subject-predicate form, the ‘is’ of identity, and the elemental- 
ism of the ^-system are perhaps the main semantic factors in need of 
revision, as they are found to be the foundation of the insufficiency of 
this system and represent the mechanism of semantic disturbances, mak- 
ing general adjustment and sanity impossible These doctrines have 
come down to us, and through the mechanism of language the semantic 
disturbing factors are forced upon our children A whole procedure of 
training in delusional values was thus started for future generations 
As the work of Aristotle w'as, at his date, the most advanced and 
‘scientific’, quite naturally its influence was wide-spread In those days, 
no one spoke of this influence as ‘linguistic’, involving sr Aristotle’s 
work was, and still is, spoken of as ‘philosophy’, and we speak mostly 
of the influence of A ‘philosophy’ rather than of the A structure of 
language, and its semantic influence 

As we have already seen, when we make any proposition whatsoever 
we involve creeds, or metaphysics, which are embodied silently as struc- 
tural assumptions and in our undefined terms The use of terms not 

371 



372 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


definable m simpler terms at a given date is inherent and seemingly 
unavoidable 

When our primitive ancestors were building their language, quite 
naturally they started with the lowest orders of abstractions, which are 
the most immediately connected with the outside world They estab- 
lished a language of ‘sensations’. Like infants, they identified their feel- 
ings with the outside world and personified most of the outside events 

This pnmitive semantic tendency resulted in the building of a lan- 
guage m which the 'is' of identity was fundamental If we saw an animal 
and called it ‘dog’ and saiv another animal roughly resembling the first, 
we said, quite happily, ‘it is a dog’, forgetting or not knowing that the 
objective level is un-speakable and that we deal only with absolute indi- 
viduals, each one different from the other Thus the mechanism of 
identification or confusion of orders of abstractions, natural at a very 
primitive stage of human development, became systematized and struc- 
turally embodied in this most important tool of daily use called ‘lan- 
guage’ Having to deal with many objects, they had to have names for 
objects These names were ‘substantives’ They built ‘substantives’, 
grammatically speaking, for other feelings w'hich were not ‘substantives', 
(‘colour’, ‘heat’, ‘soul’, ) Judging by the lower order abstractions, they ' 
built adjectnes and made a completely anthropomorphised world-picture 
Speaking about speaking, let us be perfectly aware from the beginning 
that, when we make the simplest statement of any sort, this statement 
already presupposes some kind of structural metaphysics The ^arly 
vague feelings and savage speculations about the structure of this world, 
based on primitive insufficient scientific data, was influencing the building 
of the language Once the language was built, and, particularly, systema- 
tized, these primitive structural metaphysics and sr had to be projected 
or reflected on the outside world — ^a procedure which became habitual 
and automatic 

Was such a language structurally reliable and safe i* If we investigate, 
we can easily become convinced that it was not Let us take three pails 
of water , the first at the temperature of 10° centigrade, the second at 
30°, and the third at 50°. Let us put the left hand in the first pail and 
the right in the third If we presently withdraw the left hand from the 
first pail and put it in the second, we feel how nicely warm the w'ater in 
the second pail is But, if we wuthdraw the right hand from the third 
pail and put it in the second, we notice how cold the water is The 
temperature of the water in the second pail w'as practically not different 
m the two cases, yet our feelings registered a marked difference The 
difference in the ‘feel’ depended on the former conditions to which our 



ON ABSTRACTING 


373 


hands had been subjected Thus, we see that a language of ‘senses’ is 
not a very reliable language, and that we cannot depend on it for general 
purposes of evaluation. 

How about the term ‘dog’? The number of individuals with which 
any one is directly acquainted is, by necessity, liniited, and usually is 
small Let us imagine that someone had dealt only with good-natured 
‘dogs’, and had never been bitten by any of them Next he sees some ani- 
mal , he says, ‘This ts a dog’ , his associations (relations) do not suggest 
a bite, he approaches the animal and begins to play with him, and is 
bitten Was the statement ‘this ts a dog’ a safe statement? Obviously 
not He approached the animal with semantic expectations and evalua- 
tion of his verbal definition, but was bitten by the non-verbal, un-speakable 
objective level, which has diflPerent characteristics 

Judging by present standards, knowledge in the days of Aristotle 
was very meagre It was comparatively easy 2300 years ago to sum- 
marize the few facts knowm, and so to build generalizations which 
would cover those few facts 

If we attempt to build a J[-system, 1933, can we escape the difficul- 
ties which beset Aristotle ’ The answer is that some difficulties are avoid- 
able, but that some are inherent in the structure of human knowledge, 
and so cannot be entirely evadedi 'We can, however, invent new methods 
by which the harmful semantic effect of these limitations can be success- 
fully eliminated 

There is no escape from the fact that we must start with undefined 
terms which express silent, structural creeds or metaphysics If we state 
our undefined terms explicitly, we, at least, make our metaphysics con- 
scious and public, and so we facilitate criticism, co-operation , The mod- 
ern undefined scientific terms, such as ‘order’, for instance, underlie the 
exact sciences and our wider world-outlook We must start with these 
undefined terms as well as the modem structural world-outlook as given 
by science, 1933 That settles the important semantic point of our struc- 
tural metaphysics. It need hardly be emphasized that m a human class of 
life, where creeds are characterized by having dates, they should always 
be labelled with this date For sanity, the creeds utilized in 1933 should 
be of the issue of 1 933 

Now as to the structure of our language What structure shall we 
give to our language ? Shall we keep the old structure, with all its primi- 
tive implications and corresponding s r, or shall we deliberately build a 
language of new structure which will carry new modern implications 
and Jr? There seems to be only one reasonable choice For a -system, 
we must build a new language We must abandon the ‘is’ of identity, to 



374 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


say the least We have already seen that we have an excellent substitute 
in an actional, behaviouristic, operational, functional language This type 
of language involves modern asymmetrical implications of ‘order’, and 
eliminates the ‘is’ of identity, which always introduces false evaluation 

To these fundamental starting points, we must add the principle 
that our language should be of non-el structure With these minimum 
semantic requirements, we are ready to proceed 

Let us take any object of ordinary experience, let us say the one we 
usually call a ‘pencil’, and let us briefly analyse our nervous relationship 
to it We can see it, touch it, smell it, taste it , and use it m different 
ways Is any of the relationships just mentioned an ‘all-embracing’ one, 
or IS our acquaintance through any of them only partial^ Obviously, each 
of these means provides an acquaintance with this obj’ect which is not 
only partial, but is also specific for the nerve centres which are engaged 
Thus, when we look at the object, we do not get odor or taste stimuli, 
but only visual stimuli , . 

If the object we call ‘pencil’ were lying on the surface of this paper 
and we were to look at it along the surface of the paper m a perpendicu- 
lar direction to its length, it would generally be seen as an elongated 
object, pointed at one end But, if we were to observe it along the plane 
of the paper at right angles to our former direction, it would be seen as 
a disk This illustration is rough, but serves to show that the acquain- 
tance derived through any specific means (eg, vision) is also partial in 
another sense , it varies with the position , of any specified observer. 
Smith, or a camera 

Furthermore, any given means provides, for different observers, 
different acquaintances Thus, vision shows the pencil to one observer. 
Smith, as a pointed rod, and to another observer, Jones, as a disk Feel- 
ing, through other receptors, is just as dependent upon many conditions ; 
and different observers receive different impressions This is well illus- 
trated by the familiar tale of the five blind men and the elephant 

Because of differences in sensitivitv m the receptors of Smiths and 
Browns (partial colour-blindness, astigmatism, far-sightedness ,), any 
given means of acquaintance (e g , vision) gives to different observers 
different reports of the one object The acquaintance is thus personal 
and individual 

Again, the reports received through particular channels are influ- 
enced by the kind of reports that ha\e alieady come through that channel 
To one who has not seen trees frequently, a spruce and a balsam are not 
seen to be different They are just ‘evergreens’ With better educated 
seeing, this individual later differentiates, perhaps, four kinds of spruce 



ON ABSTRACTING 


375 


Because of this factor of experience, the response of each individual to 
similar external stimuli is individual We can only agree on colours, 
shapes, distances , by ignoring the fact that the effect of the ‘same’ 
stimulus is different m different individuals Besides that, we have no 
accurate means of comparing our impressions 

The ‘time’ factor enters, in that we cannot become acquainted with 
our pencil on all sides at once Nor can we observe the outer form and 
the inner structure at the ‘same time’ We may even neglect to examine 
the inner structure entirely. Even more important is the fact that all our 
means together give us only a partial and personal acquaintance with the 
‘pencil’. Continually we invent extra-neural means which reveal new 
characteristics and finer detail Nor is this process ever completed No 
one can ever acquire a ‘complete’ acquaintance with even so simple an 
object as a pencil The chemistry, the physics, the uses of the varieties , 
offer fields of acquaintance .that can be extended indefinitely Nature is 
inexhaustible; the events have infinite numbers of characteristics, and 
this accounts for the wealth and infinite numbers of possibilities in nature 
I used the word ‘acquaintance’ deliberately, because it seems vague, 
and, as yet, el gambling on words have not spoiled this term I had to 
avoid the el terms ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ as much as possible in this analysis 
If we recall the example of paper roses m the case of hay fever, we 
shall realize that the terms ‘senses’ and ‘mind’ are not reliable, particu- 
larly in humans As a further instance, we have but to remember the 
experiment with newspaper headlines, also cited earlier 

We become better acquainted with the object by exploring it in 
manifold ways, and building for ourselves different pictures, all partial, 
and supplied by direct or indirect contact with different nerve cen- 
tres In these explorations, different nerve centres supply their specific 
responses to the different stimuli Other higher nerve centres summarize 
them, eliminate weaker details, and so, gradually, our acquaintance 
becomes fuller while yet remaining specific and partial, and the semantic 
problems of evaluation, meanings, begin to be important 

If we try to select a term which would describe structurally the 
processes which are essential for our acquaintance with the object, wc 
should select a term which implies ‘non-allness’ and the specificity of 
the response to the stimuli 

If we pass from such a primitiv'^e level to a level of 1933, and 
enquire what we actually know about an object and the structure of its 
material, we find that in 1933 we know positively that the internal struc- 
ture of materials is very different from what we gather by our rough 
‘senses’ on the macroscopic level It appears of a dynamic character and 



376 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


of an extremely fine structure, which neither light, nor the nerve centres 
affected by light, can register 

What we see is structurally only a specific statistical mass-effect of 
happenings on a much finer grained level We see what we see because 
we miss all the finer details For our purpose, it is usually enough to 
deal only with sight; this simplifies writing, and the comments made 
apply to all other ‘senses’, though perhaps in different degrees 

In 1933, in our human economy, we have to take into account at 
least three levels The one is the sub-microscopic level of science, what 
science ‘knows’ about ‘it’ The second is the gross macroscopic, daily 
experience level of rough objects The third is the verbal level 

We must also evaluate an important semantic issue, namely, the 
relative importance of these three levels We know already that to 
become acquainted with an object, we must not only explore it from all 
possible points of view and put it in contact.with as many nerve centres 
as w'e can, as this is an essential condition of ‘knowing’, but we must 
also not forget that our nerve centres must summarize the different par- 
tial, abstracted, specific pictures In the human class of life, we find a 
new factor, non-existent in any other form of life , namely, that we have 
a capacity to collect all known experiences of different individuals Such 
a capacity increases enormously the number of observations a single 
individual can handle, and so our acquaintance with the world around, 
and 111 , us becomes much more refined and exact This capacity, which 
I call the time-binding capacity, is only possible because, in distinction 
from the animals, we have evolved, or perfected, extra-neural means by 
which, without altering our nervous system, we can refine its operation 
and expand its scope Our scientific instruments record what ordinarily 
we cannot see, hear, Our neural verbal centres allow us to exchange 
and accumulate experiences, although no one could live through all of 
them , and they would be soon forgotten if we had no neural and extra- 
neural means to record them 

Again the organism works as-a-whole. All forms of human activi- 
ties are interconnected It is impossible to select a special characteristic 
and treat it in a delusional el ‘isolation’ as the most important Science 
becomes an extra-neural extension of the human nervous system We 
might expect the structure of the nervous system to throw some light on 
the structure of science, and, vice versa, the structure of science might 
elucidate the working of the human nervous system 

This fact IS very important, semantically, and usually is not suffi- 
ciently emphasized or analysed enough When we take these undeniable 
facts into account, we find the results already reached to be quite natural 



ON ABSTRACTING 


377 


and necessary, and we understand better why an individual cannot be 
considered entirely sane if he is wholly ignorant of scientific method and 
structure, and so retains primitive s r 

For a theory of sanity, all three levels are important Our ‘senses’ 
react as they do because they are united as-a-whole in one living struc- 
ture, which has potentialities or capacities for language and science 
If we enquire what we do m science, we find that we ‘observe’ 
silently and then record our observations verbally From a neurological 
point of view, we abstract whatever we and the instruments can , then 
we summarize, and, finally, we generalize, by which we mean the 
processes of abstracting cairied further 

In our ‘acquaintance’ with daily objects, we do substantially a similar 
thing. We abstract whatever we can, and, according to the degree of 
intelligence and information we have, we summarize and generalize 
From the psychophysiological point of view, the ignorant is neiirologically 
deficient But to ‘know’ or to ‘believe’ something which is false to facts 
is still more dangerous and akin to delusions, as psychiatry and daily 
experience teach us ^ It is a neurological fallacy to treat science m 
‘isolation’ and disregard its psychophysiological role 

In the building of our language, a similar neurological process 
becomes evident. If we were to see a series of different individuals, 
whom we might call Smith, Brown, Jones , we could, by a process of 
abstracting the characteristics, segregate the individuals by sizes or 
colours , then, by concentration on one characteristic and disregarding 
the others, we could build classes or higher abstractions, such as ‘whites’, 
‘blacks’. Abstracting again, with rejection of the colour difference , we 
would finally reach the term ‘man’ This procedure is general 

Anthropological studies show clearly how the degree of ‘culture’ 
among primitive peoples can be measured by the orders of the abstrac- 
tions they have produced Primitive languages are characterized particu- 
larly by an enormous number of names for indnidual objects Some 
savage races have names for a pine or an oak , but have no ‘tree’, which 
IS a higher abstraction from ‘pines’, ‘oaks’. Some other tribes have the 
term ‘tree’, but do not have a still higher abstraction ‘woods’ It does 
not need much emphasis to see that higher abstractions are extremely 
expedient de\ices There is an enormous economy which facilitates 
mutual understanding in being able to be brief in a statement and yet 
cover wider subjects 

Let us consider a primitive statement ‘I have seen treei’, followed 
by a description of the individual characteristics ‘I have seen trees’, with 
minute individual description , where treei, trees , stand for names of 



378 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


the individual trees If an event of interest had happened in a place 
where there were a hundred trees, it would take a long while to observe 
fairly well the individual trees and still longer to give an approximate 
description of them Such a method is non-expedient, fundamentally 
endless, the mechanism is cumbersome, involves many irrelevant charac- 
teristics , and it IS impossible to express in a few words much that might 
be impoi taut Progress must be slow , the general level of development 
of a given race or individual must be low It should be noticed that the 
problem of evaluation enters, at once implying many most important 
ps) cho-logical and semantic processes Similar remarks apply to the 
abstracting of infants, ‘mentally’ deficient grown-ups, and some ‘men- 
tally’ ill 

Indeed, as the readers of my Manhood of Humanity already know, 
the ‘human class of life’ is chiefly differentiated from ‘animals' by its 
rapid rate of progress through the rapid rate of accumulation of past 
experiences This is possible only when expedient means of communi- 
cation are established , that is, when higher and higher orders of abstrac- 
tions are worked out 

All scientific ‘laws’, and other generalizations of higher order (even 
single words), are precisely such methods of expediency, and represent 
abstractions of very high order They are uniquely important because 
they accelerate progress and help the further summarizing and abstract- 
ing of results achieved by others Naturally, this process of abstracting 
has also unique practical consequences When chemical ‘elements’ were 
‘permanent’ and ‘immutable', our physics and chemistry were much 
undeveloped With the advent of higher abstractions, such as the monis- 
tic and general dynamic theories of all ‘matter’ and ‘electricity’, unitary 
field theories , the creative freedom of science and the control over 
‘nature’ have increased enormously and will increase still more 

Psychiatry also seems to give data indicating that ‘mental’ illnesses 
are connected either with arrested development or with regression to 
phylogenetically older and more primitive levels, all of w'hich, of course, 
involves lower order abstractions From the point of view of a theory of 
sanity, a sharp differentiation between ‘man’ and ‘animal’ becomes im- 
perative For with ‘man’, the lack of knowledge of this difference may 
lead to the copying of animals, which wmuld involve semantic regression 
and ultimately become a ‘mental’ illness 

Although organisms have had acquaintance with objects for many 
hundreds or thousands of millions of years, the higher abstractions 
which characterize ‘man’ are only a few hundreds of thousands of years 
old As a result, the nervous currents have a natural tendency to select 



ON ABSTRACTING 


379 


the older, more travelled, nervous paths Education should counteract 
this tendency which, from a human point of view, represents regression 
or under-development 

By now we know how important it is for a ^-system to abandon 
the older implications and adopt an actional, behaviouristic, operational, 
or functional language On the neurological level, what the nervous sys- 
tem does is abstracting, of which the summarization, integration , are 
only special aspects Hence, I select the term abstracting as fundamental 

The standard meaning of ‘abstract’, ‘abstracting’ implies ‘selecting’, 
‘picking out’, ‘separating’, ‘summarizing’, ‘deducting’, ‘removing’, ‘omit- 
ting’, ‘disengaging’, ‘taking away’, ‘stripping’, and, as an adjective, not 
‘concrete’ We see that the term ‘abstracting’ implies structurally and 
semantically the activities characteristic of the nervons system, and so 
serves as an excellent functional physiological term 

There are other reasons for making the term ‘abstracting’ funda- 
mental, which, from a practical point of view, are important A bad 
habit cannot be easily eliminated except by forming a new semantic 
counter-reaction All of us have some undesirable but thoroughly estab- 
lished linguistic habits and sr which have become almost automatic, 
overloaded with unconscious ‘emotional’ evaluation This is the reason 
why new ‘non-systems’ are, in the beginning, so extremely difficult to 
acquire We have to break down the old structural habits before we can 
acquire the new sr The E geometries or the N systems are not any 
more difficult than the older systems were Perhaps they are even simpler 
The mam semantic difficulty, for those accustomed to the old, consists 
in breaking the old structural linguistic habits, in becoming once more 
flexible and receptive m feelings, and m acquiring new sr Similar 
remarks apply in a more marked degree to a H-system The majority of 
us have very little to do directly with £ oriV systems (although indirectly 
we all have a good deal to do with them) But all of us In-e our imme- 
diate lives in a human world still desperately A Plence a H-system, no 
matter what benefits it may give, is much handicapped by the old semantic 
blockages 

In building such a system, this natural resistance or persistence of 
the old sr must be taken into consideration and, if possible, counter- 
acted One of the most pernicious bad habits which we have acquired 
‘emotionally’ from the old language is the feeling of ‘allness’, of ‘con- 
creteness’, in connection with the ‘is’ of identity and elementalism One 
of the mam points in the present ,,4-system is first to remove entirely 
from our sr this allness’ and ‘concreteness’, both of which are struc- 
turally unjustified and lead to identification, absolutism, dogmatism, and 



380 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


other semantic disturbances Usually, the term ‘abstract’ is contrasted 
with ‘concrete’, w'hich is connected w'lth some vague feeling of ‘allness’ 
By making the functional term abstracting fundamental, we establish a 
most efficient semantic counter-reaction to replace the older terms which 
had such vicious structural implications Indeed, it is comparatively easy 
to accept the term ‘abstractions of different orders’, and any one who 
does so w'lll see how much clarity and how much semantic balance he 
will automatically acquire 

From a non-el point of view, the term ‘abstracting’ is also very 
satisfactory The structure of the nervous system is in ordered levels, 
and all levels go through the process of abstracting from the other levels. 

The term implies a general activity, not only of the nervous system 
as-a-w hole, but e\ en of all living protoplasm, as already explained The 
characteristic actuities of the nervous system, such as summarizing, 
integrating , are also included by implication 

If we wish to use our terms m the strictly non-el way, we must 
abandon the older division of ‘physiological abstractions’, wdiich implies 
‘body’, and of ‘mental abstractions’, w'hich, m turn, implies ‘mind’, both 
taken m an el way We can easily do that by postulating abstractions of 
different orders We should notice that the above use of the term 
'abstracting' differs from the old usage The semantic difference is in 
uniting all the abstractions our nervous system performs under the one 
term, and m distinguishing between different abstractions by the order 
of them, which is functionally, as well as structural!}, justified 

The term ‘first order abstractions’ or ‘abstractions of lower order' 
does not distinguish between ‘body’ and ‘mind’. Practically, it corres- 
ponds roughly to ‘senses’ or immediate feelings, except that by implica- 
tion It does not eliminate 'mind’ Neither does the term ‘abstractions of 
higher orders’ eliminate ‘body’ or ‘senses’, although it corresponds 
roughly to ‘mental’ processes 

From the point of view of ‘order’, the term ‘abstracting’ has a great 
deal in its favor We have seen what serious structural and semantic 
importance the term ‘order’ has, and how the activity of the nervous 
system has to be spoken of m terms of order If we establish the term 
‘abstracting’ as fundamental for its general semantic implications, we can 
easil} make the meanings more definite and specific m each case by 
ha\ mg ‘abstractions of different orders’ 

We have seen also that the terms w'e select should involve environ- 
ment by implication : it is not difficult to see that the term ‘abstracting’ 
implies ‘abstracting from something’ and so involves the environment 
as an implication. 



ON ABSTRACTING 


381 


The term ‘abstractions of different orders’ is, in this work, as 
fundamental as the term ‘time-binding’ was in the author’s earlier 
Manhood of Humanity Hence, it is impossible to be comprehensive 
about It at this stage , more will be forthcoming as we pi occed 

But we have already come to some important semantic results We 
have selected our structural metaphjsics, and decided that m 1933 we 
should accept the metaphysics of 1933, which is given cxchisn'cly bi 
science. We have decided to abandon the false to facts ‘is’ of identity 
and to use, instead, the best available language, namely, an actinnal, 
behaviouristic, functional, operational language, based on ‘order’ And, 
finally, t\e have found a term which is functionally satisfactory and has 
the correct structural and neural implications, and which represents a 
non-el term, and of which the meanings can he expanded and rermed 
indefinitely by assigning to them different orders 

In passing on to the general scientific outlook, similar structural 
remarks upon a non-el point of view apply, and are semantically of 
importance Because of the non-el character of the work of the writers 
on the Einstein and new quantum theories, much use is marie of this 
material m the present work There is a marked structural, methodo- 
logical, and semantic parallelism between all modern non-el strivings, 
which are extremely effective psycho-logically More material on this 
subject IS given m Parts IX and X 

Now, returning to the analysis of the object which we called ‘pencil’, 
we observe that, m spite of all ‘similarities’, thii object is unique, is 
different from anything else, and has a unique relationship to the rest of 
the world Hence, we should give the object a unique name f''or- 
tunately, we have already become acquainted with the way mathema- 
ticians manufacture an endless array of individual names without unduly 
expanding the vocabulary If we call the given object ‘pencil,’, we 
could call another similar object ‘pencil^’. In this way, we produce 
individual names, and so cover the differences By keeping the main 
root word ‘pencil’, we keep the implications of daily life, and also of 
similarities The habitual use of such a device is strueturally and seman- 
tically of extreme importance It has already been emphasi/.f d rt]'eatcdly 
that our abstracting from physical objects or situations proceeds by miss- 
ing, neglecting, or forgetting, and that those disregarded charactcri-lics 
usually produce errors in evaluation, resulting in the disasters of life 
If we acquire this extensional mathematical habit of using special 
names for unique individuals, we become conscious, not only of the 
similarities, but also of the differences, which consciousness is one of the 



382 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


mechanisms for helping the proper evaluation and so preventing or 
eliminating semantic disturbances 

So we now have befoie us a unique object which we call by a 
unique name ‘pencili’. If we enquire what science 1933 has to say about 
this object, we find that this object represents structurally an extremely 
complex, dynamic process For our purpose, which is intuitive, it is of 
little importance whether we accept the object as made up of atoms and 
the atom as made up of whirling electrons , or whether we accept the 
newer quantum theory, as gi% en in Part X, according to which the atom 
is formulated in terms of ‘electrons’ but the ‘electron’ is the legion 
w'here some w'aves reinforce each other, instead of being a ‘bit’ of some- 
thing It IS of no importance from our point of view whether the atoms 
are of a finite size or whether they extend indefinitely and are noticeable 
to us only in the regions of reinforcement of the waves Naturally, this 
last hypothesis has a strong semantic appeal, since it ivould account, 
when worked out, for many other facts, such as ‘fulness’, in a non-el 
language , but probably it would necessitate a postulation of some sub- 
electronic structures. 

What is important for our sr is that w'e realize the fact that the’ 
gross macroscopic materials with which we are familiar are not simply 
what we see, feel , but consist of djmamic processes of some extremely 
fine structure, and that we realize further that our ‘senses’ are not 
adapted to register these processes without the help of extia-neural 
means and higher order abstractions 

Let us recall, in this connection, the familiar example of a rotary 
fan, which is made up of separate radial blades, but which, w'hen rotat- 
ing w'lth a ceitam velocity, gives the impression of a solid disk In this 

case the ‘disk’ is 



not ‘reality’, but a 
nervous integration, 
or abstraction from 
the rotating blades. 
We not only see the 
‘disk’ (&) where 
there is no disk, 
but, if the blades 
rotate fast enough, 


Fig la 


Fic lb w^e could not throw 


sand through them, 

as the sand would be too slow to get through before being struck by one 
of the blades. 



ON ABSTRACTING 


383 


The ‘disk’ represents a joint phenomenon of the rotating blades (a) 
and of the abstracting power of our neivous system, which registers 
only the gross macroscopic aspects and slow velocities, but not the finer 
activities on subtler levels VVe cannot blame ‘the finite mind’ for the 
failure to register the separate blades, because physical instruments may 
behave similarly For instance, the illustrations (a) and (6) are photo- 
graphs of a small fan which I use in lectures, and the photographic 
camera also missed the rotating blades and registered only a ‘disk’, in 
Fig lb 

Something roughly similar may be assumed for our purpose as 
vgoing on m what we usually call ‘materials’ These are composed of 
^ome dynamic, fine-grained processes, not unlike the ‘rotating blades’ of 
pur example , and what we register is the ‘disk’, be it a table or a chair 
pr ourselves 

For a similar reason, we may assume that we cannot put our finger 
through a table, as our finger is too thick and too slow, and that, for 
some materials, it takes X-rays to be agile enough to penetrate. 

The above analogies are helpful for our purpose only, but are over- 
simplified and should not be taken as a scientific explanation 

This neural process seems to be very general, and in all our daily 
experiences the dynamic fine structures are lost to our rough ‘senses’. 
We register ‘disks’, although investigation discovers not ‘disks’, but 
rotating ‘blades’ Our gross macroscopic experience is only a nervous 
abstraction of some definite order. 

As we need to speak about such problems, we must select the best 
language at our disposal This ought to be non-el and, structurally, the 
closest to facts Such a language has been built, and is to be found in 
the differential and four-dimensional language of space-time, and in the 
new quantum mechanics In practice, it is simple to ascribe to every 
‘point of space’ a date, but it takes some training to get this s r The 
language of space-time is non-el To the new notion of a ‘point’ m 
‘space-time’ such a ‘point’, always having a date associated with it and 
hence never identical with any other point, the name of ‘point-event’, or 
simply ‘event’, has been given 

How to pass from point-events to extended macroscopic events is a 
problem in mathematical ‘logic’ Several quite satisfactoiy schemes have 
been given, into the details of which we do not need to enter here As 
the non-el structure of the language of space-time appears different from 
the older el language of ‘space’ and ‘time’, quite obviously the old term 
‘matter’, which belonged to the descriptive apparatus of ‘space’ and 
‘time’, should be abandoned also, and the ‘bits’ of materials we dealt with 



384 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


should be referred to by structurally new terms. In fact, we know that 
the old term ‘matter’ can be displaced by some other term connected with 
the ‘curvature’ of ‘space-time’ 

There is on record a striking example of what the structure of a 
form of representation means In a paper printed m the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Science, February, 1926, Professor G Y. 
Raimcli, the mathematician, tried to introduce 'mass’ into space-time, 
the terms belonging to forms of representation of different structure 
He succeeded, but at the price of sphtting space-time into the original 
space and time This is, as far as my knowledge goes, the first proof of 
how intimately a form of representation is inwardly and structurally 
interconnected This fact is of extraordinary semantic importance for 
psycho-logicians and psychiatrists, who always study S 3 mibolism of some 
sort It would be of great interest to have such problems worked out 
by them 

As abstracting m many orders seems to be a general process found 
in all forms of life, but particularly in humans, it is of importance to be 
clear on this subject and to select a language of proper structure As 
we know already, we use one term, say ‘apple’, for at least four entirely 
different entities, namely, (1) the event, or scientific object, or the 
sub-microscopic physico-chemical processes, (2) the ordinary object manu- 
factured from the event by our lower nervous centres, (3) the psycho- 
logical picture probably manufactured by the higher centres, and (4) the 
verbal definition of the term If we use a language of adjectives and 
subject-predicate forms pertaining to ‘sense’ impressions, we are using 
a language which deals with entities inside our skin and characteristics 
entirely non-existent in the outside world Thus the events outside our 
skin are neither cold nor warm, green nor red, sweet nor bitter , but 
these characteristics are manufactured by our nervous system inside our 
skins, as responses only to different energy manifestations, physico- 
chemical processes , When we use such terms, we are dealing with char- 
acteristics which are absent in the external world, and build up an 
anthropomorphic and delusional world non-similar in structure to the 
world around us Not so if we use a language of order, relations, or 
structure, which can be applied to sub-microscopic events, to objective 
levels, to semantic levels, and which can also be expressed m words In 
using such language, we deal with characteristics found or discovered on 
all levels which give us structuial data uniquely important for knowledge. 
The ordering on semantic levels m the meantime abolishes identification 
It IS of extreme importance to realize that the relational , attitude is 
optional and can be applied everywhere and always, once the above- 



ON ABSTRACTING 


385 


mentioned benefits are realized Thus, any object can be considered as a ' 
set of relations of its parts , any ‘sense’ perception may be considered as 
a response to a stimulus , which again introduces relations , As relations 
are found in the scientific sub-microscopic world, the objective world, 
and also m the psycho-logical and verbal worlds, it is beneficial to use 
such a language because it is similar m structure to the external world 
and our nervous system , and it is applicable to all levels The use of 
such a language leads to the discovery of invariant relations usually 
called ‘laws of nature’, gives us structural data which make the only 
possible content of ‘knowledge’, and eliminates also anthropomorphic, 
primitive, and delusional speculations, identifications, and harmful s.r.

You cannot recognise an event, because when it is gone, it is gone . . 
But a character of an event can be recognised . Things which we thus 
recognise I call objects (S73) a n whitehead 

When there is a judgment of identity or difference, it is because a par- 
ticular associative reaction of the second order is occurring, conditioned 
by the primary reaction, whether the same or different, this is a gain in 
perceptive knowledge (4ii) henri PifeRON 

To some extent, the practice of thinking, deciding, feeling, appreciating, 
and sympathiring molds the personality of the thinker Presumably, the 
stable patterns of cortical association are changed by the performance of 
these acts just as on a lower plane muscles arc changed by systematic 
exercises (222) c judson herrick 

Experimental analysis of the memory of forms insusceptible of symbolic 
schematization has convinced me of the great importance of ocular kinaes- 
thesia and the small part played by visualization in nearly all individuals, 
with the general illusion of really visual representations, a very strong 
illusion, especially when symbolic and verbal schematization is possible. 
Ideas which are substituted for visual representation, and play the same 
part, are easily mistaken for it (4it) henri pi6ron 

The eyes of the dog give to him sometimes a more intelligent expression 
than that of his master, and there is no doubt that he uses them to very 
good advantage, but they are not our eyes (221) c judson herrick 


Before I recapitulate, in the form of a structural diagram, what 
has been said m the pretious chapter, I must explain briefly the use of 
the term ‘event’ The introduction of new terms in a language always 
represents initial difficulties to the student It is always advisable, if 
only possible, to introduce terms which are structurally close to our 
daily experience At present, m physics, we have a dual language , one 
of ‘space-time’, in which ‘matter’ is connected somehow with its ‘curva- 
ture’, the other of the quanta The structure of both languages is quite 
different, and at present scientists have not succeeded in translating one 
language into the other Einstein, m his latest unified field theory, has 
succeeded, by the introduction of new notions, in amalgamating the 
electiomagnetic phenomena with the general theory of relativitj , but 
even this new language does not include the quantum theory For my 
purpose, it IS important to amalgamate both languages as an intuitive pic- 
torial device, which, from a technical point of view, still awaits formula- 
tion As the ‘space-time’ continuum is the closest to our daily experience, 
I accept the language of ‘events’ as fundamental and add only a few 

386 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


387 


pictorial notions taken from the quantum theory There is no doubt that 
the day is not far off when the unified field theory will be extended to 
include the new quantum theory, and so this anticipation does not 
appear illegitimate 

If we take something, anything, let us say the object already re- 
ferred to, called ‘pencil’, and enquire what it represents, according to 
science 1933, we find that the ‘scientific object’ represents an ‘event’, a 
mad dance of ‘electrons’, which is different every instant, ivhich never 
repeats itself, which is known to consist of extremely complex dynamic 
processes of very fine structure, acted upon bj , and reacting upon, the 
rest of the universe, inextricably connected with everything else and 
dependent on everything else If we enquire Iwzv many characteristics 
(mo) we should ascribe to such an event, the only possible answer is 
that we should ascribe to an event infinite numbers of characteristics, as 
It represents a process which never stops m one form or another , 
neither, to the best of our knowledge, does it repeat itself 

In our diagram. Fig 1, we. indicate this by a parabola (A), which 
is supposed to extend indefinitely, which extension we indicate by a 
broken off line (B) We symbolize the characteristics by small circles 
(C), the number of which is obviously indefinitely great 

Underneath, we symbolize the ‘object’ by the circle (O), wduch has 
a finite size The characteristics of the object we also denote by similar 
little circles (C') The number of characteristics which an object has 
IS large but finite, and is denoted by the finite number of the small 
circles (C) 

Then we attach a label to the object, its name, let us sav ‘pencili’, 
which we indicate in our diagram by the label (L) We ascribe, also, 
characteristics to the labels, and we indicate these characteristics by the 
little circles (C") 

The number of characteristics which we ascribe by definition to the 
label IS still smaller than the number of characteristics the object has 
To the label ‘pencil’ we would ascribe, perhaps, its length, thickness, 
shape, colour, hardness , But we would mostly disregard the accidental 
characteristics, such as a scratch on its surface, or the kind of glue by 
which the two wooden parts of the objective ‘pencil’ are held together, 
If we want an objective ‘pencil’ and come to a shop to purchase one. 
we say so and specify verbally only these characteristics which are of 
particular immediate interest to us 

It is clear that the object is often of interest to us for some special 
characteristics of immediate usefulness or \alue If w'e enquire as to the 
neurological processes involved in registering the object, we find that the 





ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


389 


nervous system has absti acted, from the infinite numbers of sub-micro- 
scopic characteristics of the event, a large but finite number of macro- 
scopic characteristics In purchasing a ‘pencil’ we usually are not 
interested m its smell or taste But if we were interested in these 
abstractions, we would have to find the smell and the taste of our object 
by experiment 

But this is not all The object represents in this language a gross 
macroscopic abstraction, for our nervous system is not adapted for 
abstracting directly the infinite numbers of chaiacteristics which the end- 
lessly complex dynamic fine structure of the event represents We must 
consider the object as a 'first abstraction’ (with a finite number" of char- 
acteristics) from the infinite numbers of characteristics an event has 
The above considerations are m perfect accord not only with the func- 
tioning of the nervous system but also with its structure Our nervous 
system registers objects with its lower centres first, and each of these 
lower specific abstractions we call an object If we were to define an 
object, we should have to say that an object represents a first abstrac- 
tion with a finite number of in o characteristics from the infinite num- 
bers of m 0 characteristics an event has 

Obviously, if our inspection of the object is through the lower 
nervous centres, the number of characteristics which the object has is 
larger (taste, smell., of our pencili) than the number of characteristics 
which u e need to ascribe to the label The label, the importance of which 
lies in its meanings to vSj represents a still higher abstraction from the 
event, and usually labels, also, a semantic reaction 

We have come to some quite obvious and most important stiuctural 
conclusions of evaluation of the non-el tvpe We see that the object 
IS not the event but an abstraction from it, and that the label is not the 
object nor the event, but a still fuither abstraction The nervous piocess 
of abstracting we represent by the lines (N), (N') The characteristics 
left out, or not abstracted, are indicated bv' the lines (B'), (B") 

For our semantic purpose, the distinction between lower and higher 
abstractions seems fundamental , but, of course, we could call the object 
simply the first order abstraction, and the label, with its meanings, the 
second order abstraction, as indicated m the diagram 

If we were to enquire how this problem of abstracting in different 
orders appears as a limiting case among animals, we should select a defi- 
nite individual wuth which to carry on the analysis For our analysis, which 
IS deliberately of an extensional character, we select an animal with a 
definite, proper name, corresponding to ‘Smith’ among us. Such an 
animal suggests itself at once on purely verbal grounds 



390 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


It IS the one we call ‘Fido’ Practically all English speaking people 
are acquainted ith the name ‘Fido’. Besides, most of us like dogs and 
are aware of how ‘intelligent’ they are 

Investigations and experimenting have shown that the nervous 
system of a Fido presents, m structure and function, marked similarities 
to that of a Smith Accordingly, we may assume that, in a general way, 
it functions similarly We hare already spoken of the event in terms 
of recognition, namely, that w'e can never recognize an event, as it 
changes continually Whitehead points out the fundamental difference 
between an event and an object in terms of recognition, namely, that 
an event cannot be recognized, and that an object can be recognized 
He defines the object as the recognizable part of the event The use of 
this definition helps us to test whether Fido has ‘objects’ Since experi- 
ments show’ that Fido can recognize, w'e have to ascribe to Fido objects 
by definition If we enquire what the objects of Fido represent, the 
structure and function of his nervous system, which are very similar to 
ours, would suggest that Fido’s objects represent, also, abstractions of 
some low order, from the events Would his objects appear the ‘same’ 
as ours’ No First of all. the abstractions from e\ents which w'e call 
objects are not the ‘same’, even when abstracted by different individuals 
among humans An extreme example of this can be given m that lim- 
ited form of colour-blindness which is called Daltonism, when an object 
which appears green to most persons appears red to the certain few 
who suffer from this disease There is, at present, no doubt that the 
nervous abstractions of all organisms are indnidual, not only with each 
individual, but at different ‘times’ with one individual, and differ, also, 
for these higher groups (abstractions) which we call species ^\'e can 
infer how the world appears to a particular organism only if its nervous 
structure is quite similar to our own With species w'ldely separated 
neurologically, such inferences are entirely unjustified So, on general 
grounds, the ‘objects’ of Fido are not the ‘same’ as ours, on neurologi- 
cal grounds, they appear only similar In daily experience, we know that 
we should have difficulty in recognizing our owm glo\e among a thou- 
sand, but Fido could perform this detection for us much better So the 
‘same’ glove must ha^e been registered in the nervous system of Fido 
differently from the w ay it has been in ours 

We indicate this similarity of the human object (O*) and the ani- 
mal object (0„) by making the circle (Oa) smaller, and emphasize the 
difference between the objects by different!} spacing the holes represent- 
ing the characteristics Whether we call the objects (O;.) and (Oa) 
‘first order’ abstractions or ‘100th order’ abstractions, or simply ‘lower

order’ abstractions, is mainly optional There is no neurological doubt 
that all ‘objects’ represent low order absti actions and the use of a num- 
ber to indicate the order is simph' a matter of coinention and con- 
venience If we were to start with the simplest luing cell, we might 
ascribe to its abstractions the term 'first order’ abstractions If \vc were 
to survey m this way all known forms of life, we might ascribe to Fido 



392 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


and Smith very large numbers as their orders of abstractions But this 
IS unnecessary, as we shall presently see 

We note that Fido does abstract from events, at any rate, in lower 
orders, ‘has objects’ (Oa) which he can recognize The question is. 
does he abstract in higher orders ? We might answer that he does within 
certain limits Or, we might prefer to take the limits of his abstracting 
capacities for granted and to include them all as lower order abstractions 
For the sake of con\ enience and simplicity, we select the last method and 
say that he does not abstract in higher orders In our schematic repre- 
sentation, we shall discover some very important differences between 
the abstracting capacities of humans and animals, and so we introduce 
here onlj' as much complexity as we need As animals have no speech, 
111 the human sense, and as we have called the verbal labelling* of the 
object ‘second order abstraction’ we say that animals do not abstract in 
higher orders 

If we compare our diagram and what it represents with the w'ell- 
known facts of daily life, w'e see that Smith’s abstracting capacities are 
not limited to two orders, or to any ‘it’ orders of abstractions 

In our diagrams, the label (L) stands for the name which we 
assigned to the object But we can also consider the level of the first 
label (L) as a desciiptive lei el or statement We know very well that 
Smith can always say something about a statement (L), on record 
Neurologically considered, this next statement (Li) about a statement 
(L) would be the nervous response to the former statement (L) w^hicli 
he has seen or heard or even produced by himself inside his skin So his 
statement (Li), about the former statement (L), is a iiew abstraction 
from the former abstraction In my language, I call it an abstraction 
of a higher order In this case, we shall be helped by the use of num- 
bers If W'e call the level (L) an abstraction of second order, we must 
call an abstraction from this abstraction an abstraction of third order, 
(Li) Once an abstraction of third order has been produced, it becomes, 
in turn, a fact on recoid, potentially a stimulus, and can be abstracted 
further and a statement made about it, which becomes an abstraction of 
the fourth order (Lj) This process has no definite limits, for, when- 
ever statements of any order are made, we can ahvays make a statement 
about them and so produce an abstraction of still higher order. This 
capacity is practically universal among organisms which we call 
‘humans’ Here we reach a fundamental difference between ‘Smith’ 

*In the present system the terms 'label', ‘labelling’ , are always connected with 
their meanings, and so, for simplicity, from now on the reference to meanings 
will be omitted.

and ‘Fido’. Fido's power of abstracting stops somewhere^ although it 
may include a few orders Not so with ‘Smith’ , his power of abstracting 
has no known limit (see Part VI) 

Perhaps the reader is semantically perplexed by the unfamiliarity 
of the language of this analysis It must be granted that the introduction 
of any new language is generally perplexing, and it is justified only if 
the new language accomplishes something structurally and semantically 
which the old languages did not accomplish In this case, it has brought 
us to a new sharp distinction between ‘man’ and ‘animal’ The number 
of orders of abstractions an ‘animal’ can produce is limited The number 
of orders of abstractions a ‘man’ can produce is, in principle, unlimited 

Here is found the fundamental mechanism of the ‘time-binding’ 
power which characterizes man, and which allows him, m principle, to 
gather the experiences of all past generations A higher order abstrac- 
tion, let us say, of the ji -|-1 order, is made as a response to the stimulus 
of abstractions of the «th order Among ‘humans’ the abstractions of 
high orders produced by others, as well as those produced by oneself, 
are stimuli to abstracting in still higher orders Thus, in principle, we 
start where the former generation left off It should be noticed that, in 
the present anal} sis, we have abandoned the structurally el methods and 
language, and the w'hole analysis becomes simple, although non-familiar 
because it involves new noii-el s r 

The preceding explanation justifies my former statement that the 
ascribing of absolute numbers to the orders of abstractions of ‘animal’ 
and of ‘man’ is unnecessary In our diagram w'e could ascribe as many 
orders of abstractions to the animal as we please , yet we should have 
to admit, for the structural correctness of description of experimental 
facts, that the ‘animal’s’ power of abstracting has limits, while the num- 
ber of orders of abstractions a ‘man’ can produce has no known limits. 

From an epistemological and semantic point of view, there is an 
important benefit in this method In this language, we have discovered 
sharp verbal and analytical methods, in terms of the non-el ‘orders of 
abstractions’, by which these two ‘classes of life’, or these two high 
abstractions, can be differentiated The terms ‘animal’ and ‘man’ each 
represent a name for an abstraction of very high order, and not a name 
for an objective individual To formulate the difference between these 
‘classes’ becomes a problem of verbal structural ingenuity and methods, 
as in life w'e deal only with absolute individuals on the un-speakable, 
objective levels In our diagram, we could hang on the ‘animal’ object 
as many levels of labels, which stand for higher order abstractions, as 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


395 


we please, yet somewhere we woiild have to stop, hut with ‘man’ we 
could continue indefinitely. 

I This sharp difference between ‘man’ and ‘animal’ may be called the 
‘ho)isontal differenced The habitual use of our hands in showing these 
different horizontal levels is extremely useful in studying this woik, and 
It facilitates greatly the acquiring of the structurally new language and 
corresponding sr The solution of the majority of human semantic 
difficulties (evaluation), and the elimination of pathological identifica- 
tion, he precisely m the maintenance, without confusion, of the sharp 
differentiation between these horizontal levels of orders of abstractions 
Let us now investigate the possibility of a sharp ‘vertical diffcr- 
^ence’ We have already come to the conclusion that Fido abstracts 
'objects from events, and that, if his nervous system is similar to ours, 
his lower order abstractions are similar to ours Here we may ask the 
question Does Fido ‘know’, or can he ‘know’, that he abstracts'* It 
seems undeniable that Fido does not ‘know’ and cannot 'knoit/ that 
he abstracts, because tt takes science to ‘know’ that we abstract, and 
Fido has no science It is semantically important that we should be 
entirely convinced on this point We do not argue about the kind of 
‘knowledge’ animals may have or about the relative value of this ‘knowl- 
edge’ as compared with ours Science was made possible by the human 
nervous system and the invention of extra-neural means for investiga- 
tion and recording, which animals lack entirely Whoever claims that 
animals have science should, to say the least, show libraries and scientific 
laboratories and instruments produced by animals. 

We see that, although Fido has abstiactcd, he not only does not 
‘know’ but cannot ‘know’ that he abstracts, as this last ‘knowledge’ is 
given exclusively by science, which animals do not have In this con- 
sciousness of abstracting, we find a most important ‘vertical difference’ 
between Smith and Fido The difference is sharp again 

If, in our diagram. Fig 4, we asciibe to Fido more horizontal 
orders of abstractions, let us say two, (Hj) and (H 2 ), ne\ ertheless, the 
‘animal’ stops somewhere This extended diagram illustrates that ‘man’ 
IS capable of abstracting m higher and higher orders indefinitely In 
this diagram, we symbolize the fact that Fido does not and cannot 
‘know’ that he abstracts, by not connecting the characteristics of his 
object (Oa) by lines (A„) with the event (E) Without science, we 
have no event, Fido’s gross macroscopic object (Oa) repiesents ‘all 
that he ‘knows’ or cares about We see that the vertical difference (Vi) 
formulated as consciousness of abstracting for Smith appears sharp, and 
completely differentiates Fido from Smith In it, we find the semantic

mechanism of all pioper evaluation, based on non-identification or the 
differentiation between orders of abstractions, impossible with animals 
In this diagram we have introduced more objects, because each 
individual abstracts, in general, from an event different objects, in the 
sense that they are not identical in every respect We must be aware 
continuously that in life on the un-speakable objective level we deal 
only with absolute individuals, be they objects, situations, or jr The 
veitical stratification not only gives us lepreseiitation for the sharp 
difference between ‘man’ and ‘animal’, but also allows us to tram our 
jr in the absolute individuality of our objects and those of different 
observers, and for the differences between their individual abstractions 
What has been said here applies equally to all first order effects on the 
objective level, such as immediate feelings , 

The present theory can only be fully beneficial when the reader 
acquires in his system the habitual feeling of both the vertical and the 
horizontal stratifications with which identification becomes impossible.

In the experiments of Doctor Philip S Graven with the ‘mentally’ ill, 
training in the realization of this stratification has either resulted in 
complete recovery or has markedly improved the conditions of the 
patient 

The diagram is used m two distinct ways One is by showing the 
abstracting from the event to the object, and the applying of a name to 
the object The other is hy illustrating the level of statements uhich 
can be made about statements If we have different objects, and label 
them with different names, say, Ai, Aj, A 3 A„, we still have no 
proposition. To make a proposition, we have to accept some undefined 
relational term, by which we relate one object to the other The use of 
this diagram to illustrate the levels or orders of statements implies that 
we have selected some metaphysics as expressed in our undefined rela- 
tional terms We should be fully aware of the difference between these 
two uses of the one diagram for the structural illustration of two aspects 
of one process. 

If we enquire' What do the cliaracteristics of the event represent'* 
We find that they are given only by science and represent at each date 
the highest, most verified, most reliable abstractions ‘Smith’ has 
produced 

Theory and practice have shown that the points illustrated by the 
above structural diagrams have a crucial semantic significance, as, with- 
out using them, it is practically impossible to tram ourselves or others 
and to accomplish the psychophysiological re-education For this reason, 
the diagrams have been produced for home and school use, separately, 
m the simplified form illustrated in Fig 5 This structural diagram is 
called the ‘Anthropometer’ or the ‘Structural Differential’, as it illus- 
trates the fundamental structural difference between the woild, and so 
the environment, of the animal and man If we live m such a very 
complex human woild, but our sr, owing to wrong evaluation, are 
adjusted only to the simpler animal world, free, to say the least, from 
man-made complications, then adjustment and sanity for humans is 
impossible Our j r are bound to follow the simpler animalistic patterns, 
pathological for man. All human experience, scientific or otherwise, 
shows that we still copy animals in our nervous reactions, trjing to 
adjust ourselves to a world of fictitious, simple animal sfi uctiire, while 
actually we live m a world of very complex human structure which is 
quite different Naturally, under such conditions, which, ultimately, 
turn out to be delusional, human adjustment is impossible and results in 
false evaluations, animalistic sr, and the general state of un-sanity

The Structural Differential 





ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL

Any one who will work out the present analysis with the aid of the 
Differential will find clearly that the majority of human difficulties, the 
preventable or curable ‘mental’ or semantic disturbances included, are 
due to this fatal structural error, resulting in false evaluation due to 
identification or lack of differentiation 

The Structural Differentials are manufactured m two forms (1) 
in a printed map-likc scroll for hanging on the walls or black-board , (2) 
in relief form with detachable labels As the mam problem is to tram 
and re-educate the semantic psychophysiplogical reactions in non-iden- 
tity, the relief form is the most effective because of the freely hanging 
strings, detachable labels , which gi\e means to engage more nerve 
centres in the training I shall describe the latter type in some detail 

For the event we have a parabola in relief (E), broken off to indi- 
cate its limitless extension The disk (O;,) symbolizes the human object, 
the disk (Oa) represents the animal object The label (L) represents 
the higher abstraction called a name (with its meaning given by a defini- 
tion) The lines (A„) in the relief diagram aie hanging strings which 
are tied to pegs They indicate the process of abstracting The free 
hanging strings (B„) indicate the most important characteristics left out, 
neglected, or forgotten in the abstracting The Structural Differentials 
are provided with a number of separate labels attached to pegs These 
are hung, one to the other, in a scries, and the last one may be attached 
by a long peg to the event, to indicate that the chaiactenstics of the 
event represent the highest abstractions ive have produced at each date 
The objective level is not wordi, and cannot be reached by zvords alone 
We must point our Unger and be silent, or zee shall never reach this 
level Our personal feelings, also, ai e not ivorcls, and belong to the objec- 
tive level. 

The whole of the present theory can be illustrated on the Struc- 
tural Differential by the childishly simple operation of the teacher point- 
ing a finger to the event and then to the object, saying ‘This is not this’ 
and insisting on silence on the pupil’s part One should continue by 
showing with the finger the object and the label, saying again ‘This is not 
this’, insisting on silence on the objective level , then, showing the first 
and the second label, saying again ‘This is not this'. 

In a more complex language, one would say that the object is not 
the event, that the label is not the un-speakable object, and that a state- 
ment about a statement is not the ‘same’ statement, nor on one level We 
see and are made to visualize that the .(^-system is based on the denial 
of the ‘is’ of identity, which necessitates the differentiation of orders of 
abstractions

VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


The little word ‘to be’ appears as a very pertiliar word and is, per- 
haps, responsible for many human semantic difficulties If the anthro- 
pologists are correct, only a few of the primitive peoples have this verb. 
The majority do not haie it and do not need it, because all their j r and 
languages are practically based on, and involve, literal identiftcahon ^ In 
passing from the primitive stage of human society to the present slightly 
higher stage, which might be called the infantile stage, or infantile 
period, too crude identification was no longer possible Languages were 
built, based on slightly modified or limited identification, and, for flexibil- 
ity, the ‘is’ of identity was introduced explicitly Although very little 
has been done in the structural analysis of languages in general, and 
of those of primitive peoples in particular, we know that in the Indo- 
European languages the verb ‘to be’, among others, is used as an auxil- 
iary verb and also for the purpose of positing false to facts identity 
With the primitive prevalent lack of consciousness of abstracting, and 
the primitive belief in the magic of words, the sr were such that words 
were identified with the objective levels. Perhaps it is not too much to 
say that the primitive ‘psychology’ peculiarly required such a fundamen- 
tal identity Identity may be defined as ‘absolute sameness in all respects’ 
which, in a world of ever-changing processes and a human world of 
indefinitely many orders of abstractions, appears as a sti uctural impos- 
sibility Identity appears, then, as a primitive ‘over-emotional’ generaliza- 
tion of similarity, equality, equivalence, equipollence . , and, in no case, 
does It appear in fact as ‘absolute sameness in all respects’. As soon as 
the structurally delusional character of identity is pointed out, it becomes 
imperative for sanity to eliminate such delusional factors from our 
languages and s r With the ad\ent of ‘civilization’, the use of this word 
was enlarged, but some of the fundamental primitive implications and 
psycho-logical semantic effects were preserved If we use the ‘is’ at all, 
and It IS extremely difficult to avoid entirely this auxiliary verb when 
using languages w Inch, to a large extent, depend on it, we must be par- 
ticularly careful not to use ‘is’ as an identity term 

In 1933, the amount of knowledge w'e have about the primitive 
peoples IS considerable Anthropologists have gathered an enormous num- 
ber of descriptive facts, on which they practically all agree, but the 
several schools of anthropology differ widely as to the interpretation of 
these facts Roughly speaking, the British school tries to interpret the 
facts from the point of view of ascribing to the primitives the deficient 
‘psychology’ and ‘logic’ of the white man The French and Polish 
schools avoid these unjustified tendencies, and attempt to reconstruct the 
original primitive ‘psychologies’ and ‘logics’ which could be responsible 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


401 


for the developments, or the lack of developments, of the primitive 
peoples All schools accept, as yet, the existing el ‘psychologies’ and two- 
valued A ‘logic’ as the standard, normal, and, perhaps, even as the final 
disciplines for an adult human civilization No school suspects that an 
A stage of civilization appears to be built, to a large extent, on the 
slightly refined primitive identifications which produced only an infantile 
period of human development They do not suspect that a future A 
society may differ as greatly from the present A society as the latter 
differs from the primitive society. 

In my work, I prefer to follow the French and Polish schools of 
anthropology, as it seems to me that these schools are freer from seman- 
tic identification and aristoteliamsm than the others 

In 1933, it seems, beyond doubt, that if any single semantic charac- 
teristic could be selected to account for the pnmitne state of the indi- 
viduals and their societies, we could say, without making too great a 
mistake, that it would be found in identification, understood in the more 
general sense as it is used in the present work There is very little doubt, i 
at present, that different physico-chemical factors, environment, climate, 
kind of food, colloidal behaviour, endocrine secretions , are fundamental 
factors which condition the potentialities, as well as the behaviour, of an 
organism It is equally certain that, as an end-result, these physico- 
chemical factors are connected with definite t} pes oi sr It is known that 
the reverse is also true , namely, that j r affect colloidal behaviour, endo- 
crine secretions, and metabolism The exact type of dependence is not 
known, because too little experimenting on humans has been made The 
present analysis is conducted from the semantic point of \icw, and its 
results, no matter how far-reaching, are limited to this special aspect 

Simple analysis shows that identification is a necessary condition 
which underlies the reactions of animals, of infants, and of primitives. 
If found in ‘civilized’ grown-ups, it equally indicates some icmains of 
earlier periods of development, and can always be found in the analysis 
of any private or public difficulties which prevent any satisfactory solu- 
tion Identification m a slightly modified form represents, also, the very 
foundation of the .^^-system and those institutions which are founded 
on this system. 

Mathematics gives us practically the only linguistic system free 
from pathological identifications, although mathematicians use this term 
uncritically The more identification is eliminated from other sciences, 
the more the mathematical functional semantics and method are applied, 
and the further a given science progresses

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


The best we know in 1933 is that the general structure of the world 
was not different in prehistoric times from what we find it today We 
have no doubt that the materials in great antiquity consisted of mole- 
cules, molecules of atoms, and atoms of electrons and protons , or what- 
ever else we shall be able to discover some day We have no doubt that 
blood was circulating m the higher animals and humans, that vitamins 
exhibited very similar characteristics as today, that different forms of 
radiant energy influenced colloidal behaviour , , regardless of whether 
or not the given animal, primitive man or infant ‘knew’ or ‘knows’ about 
them. 

How about the primitive physical needs and uants of an animal, 
a primitive man, and an infant? Besides all mystical and m 3 rthological 
reasons for identification, the structural facts of life necessitated identi- 
''fication on this level of development Without modern knowledge, w'hat 
a hungry animal, primitive man, or an infant ‘wants’ ‘is’ an ‘object’, say, 
called an ‘apple’ He would ‘define’ his ‘apple’ the best he could as to 
shape, colour, smell, taste , Was this what his organism needed ? Ob- 
viously not We could, at present, produce an undigestible synthetic 
apple which would satisf> his eventual objective definitions; he might 
eat It, many such ‘apples’, and eventually die of hunger Is an abundant 
and pleasant diet free from unsuspected and unseen ‘vitamins’ satisfac- 
tory for surviv'al ’ Again, no * Thus, we see clearly that what the organ- 
ism needed for survival were the phj'sico-chemical processes, not found 
m the ‘ordinar} object’, but exclusiv'ely in the ‘scientific object’, or the 
event Here we find the age old and necessary, on this early level, 
identification of the ordinary object with the scientific object This form 
of identification is extremely common ev'en m 1933, and, to a large extent, 
responsible for our low development, because, no matter what we ‘think’ 
or feel about an object, an object represents only an abstraction of low 
order, only a general s'^iubol for the scientific object, which remains 
the only possible surviv al concern of the organism. But, obviously, such 
^ identification, being false to facts, can never be entirely reliable. If 
any one fancies that he deals with ‘ultimate reality’, yet that m o reality 
represents only a shadow cast by the scientific object, he begins, with 
experience, to distrust the object and populates his world with delusional 
mysticism and mythologies to account for the mysteries of the shadow 

As any organism represents an abstracting in different orders pro- 
cess, which, again, the animal, the primitive man, and the infant cannot 
know, they, by necessity, identify different orders of abstractions Thus, 
names are identified with the un-speakable objects, names for action 
with the un-speakable action itself, names for a feeling with the un- 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


403 


speakable feelings themselves , By confusing descriptions with inferences 
and descriptive words with inferential words, the ‘judgements’, ‘opinions’, 
‘beliefs’, and similar sr, which represent mostly, if not exclusively, 
inferential semantic end-products, are projected with varying pathologi- 
cal intensity on the outside world By this method pre-’logical’ primitive 
semantic attitudes were built Mere similarities were evaluated as iden- 
tities, primitive syllogisms were built of the type • ‘stags run fast, some 
Indians run fast, some Indians are stags’ It is common to find among 
j primitive peoples a kind of ‘logic’ based on the post hoc, ergo ptoptcr 
hoc (after this and, therefore, because of this) fallacy which obviously 
represents an identification of an ordinal description with an inference 
The ‘question begging epithets’, which exercise a tremendous semantic 
influence on primitive and immature peoples and represent a semantic 
factor in many primitive as well as modern taboos, are also based on 
such confusions of orders of abstractions 

Identification is one of the primitive characteristics which cannot 
be eliminated from the animal or the infant, because we have no means 
to communicate with them properly It cannot be eliminated from primi- 
tive peoples as long as they preserve their languages and environments 
Identification is extremely wide-spread among ourselves, embodied 
strongly in the structure of our inherited language and systems To 
change that primitive state of affairs, we need special simple means, such 
as a /4-system may offer, to combat effectively this serious menace to 
our sr. It should never be forgotten that identification is practically 
never dangerous in the animal world, because unaided nature plays no 
tricks on animals and the elimination by non-survival is very sharp It 
IS dangerous in the primitive stage of man, however, as it prevents the 
primitive man to become more civilized, but under his primitive condi- 
tions of life his dangers are not so acute It becomes only very danger- 
ous to the infant if not taken care of, and to the modern white man in 
the midst of a very far advanced industrial system which affects all 
phases of his life, when his j r are left unchanged from the ages gone 
by, and still remain on the infantile level 

The present H-system is not only based on the complete rejection 
of the ‘is’ of identity, but every important term which has been mtio- 
duced here, as well as the Structural Differential, is aimed at the elimina- 
tion of these relics of the animal, the primitive man, and the infant in us 
Thus, the primitive ‘mentality’ does not differentiate relations 
enough, to counteract this, I introduce the Striictwal Differential The 
primitive identifies , I introduce a system based on the denial of the ‘is’ 
of identity all through The primitive man pays most attention to what 



404 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


is conveyed to him through the eye and the ear , I introduce the Struc- 
tural Differential ivhich indicates to the eye the stratification of human 
knowledge, which represents to the eye the verbal denial of the ‘is’ of 
identity. If we identify, we do not differentiate. If we differentiate, 
we cannot identify ; hence, the Structural Differential. 

The terms used also convey similar processes. Once we have 
order, we differentiate and have orders of abstractions Once we 
abstract, w'e eliminate ‘allness’, the semantic foundation for identifica- 
tion. Once we abstract, we abstract m different orders, and so we 
order, abolishing fanciful infinities Once w'e differentiate, differen- 
tiation becomes the denial of identity Once we discriminate betiveen 
the objective and verbal levels, we learn ‘silence’ on the un-speak- 
able objective leiels, and so introduce a most beneficial neurological 
‘delay’ — engage the cortex to perform its natural function. Once 
we discriminate between the objectne and verbal levels, structure 
becomes the only link between the two worlds This results m search 
for similanty of structure and relations, which introduces the aggregate 
feeling, and the individual becomes a social being Once we differentiate, 
W'e discriminate between descnptions and inferences Once we discrimi- 
nate, we consider descriptions separately and so are led to observe the 
facts, and only from description of facts do we tentatively form infer- 
ences , . Finally, the consciousness of abstracting introduces the general 
and permanent differentiation between orders of abstractions, intro- 
duces the ordering, and so stratifications, and abolishes for good the 
pnmitive or infantile identifications The semantic passing from the 
primitive man or infantile state to the adult period becomes a semantic, 
accomplished fact It should be noticed that these results are accom- 
plished by starting with primitive means, the use of the simplest terras, 
such as ‘this is not this’, and by the direct appeal to the primitive main 
receptors — ^the eye and the ear. 

The elimination of the ‘is’ of identity appears as a serious task, 
because the /4-system and ‘logic’ by which we regulate our lives, and the 
influence of w'hich has been eliminated only partially from science, rep- 
resent only a very scholarly formulation of the restricted primitive iden- 
tification Thus, we usually assume, following A disciplines, that the ‘is’ 
of identity is fundamental for the ‘laws of thought’, which have been 
formulated as follows: 

1) The Law of Identity whatever is, is 

2) The Law of Contradiction nothing can both be and not be. 

3 ) The Law of Excluded Middle everything must either be or 
not be 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


405 


It is impossible, short of a volume, to revise this 'logic' and to 
formulate a A, oo-valued, non-elementahstic semantics which would be 
structurally similar to the world and our nervous system , but it must be 
mentioned, even here, that the ‘law of identity’ is never applicable to 
processes The 'law of excluded middle', or ‘excluded third’, as it is 
sometimes called, which gives the two-valued character to A ‘logic’, 
establishes, as a general principle, what represents only a limiting case 
and so, as a general principle, must be unsatisfactory As on the objec- 
tive, un-speakable levels, we deal exclusively with absolute individuals 
and individual situations, m the sense that they are not identical, all 
statements which, by necessity, represent higher order abstractions must 
only represent probable statements Thus, we are led to oo-valued 
semantics of probability, which introduces an inherent and general prin- 
ciple of uncertainty. 

It is true that the above given ‘laws of thought’ can and have been 
expressed in other terms with many scholarly interpretations, but fun- 
damentally the semantic state of affairs has not been altered. 

From a non-el point of view, it is more expedient to treat the 
^-system on a similar footing with the jE-system , namely, to consider 
the above ‘laws of thought’ as postulates which underlie that system and 
which express the ‘laws of thought’ of a given epoch and, eventually, 
of a race We know other systems among the primitive peoples which 
follow other ‘laws’, m which identity plays a still more integral part of 
the system. Such natives reason quite well , their systems are consistent 
with their postulates, although these are quite incomprehensible to those 
who try to apply A postulates to them From this point of view, we 
should not discuss how ‘true’ or ‘false’ the H-system appears, but we 
should simply say that, at a different epoch, other postulates seem 
structurally closer to our experience and appear more expedient Such 
an attitude would not retard so greatly the appearance of new systems 
which will supersede the present H-system 

In the present system, ‘identification’ represents a label for the 
semantic process of inappropriate evaluation on the un-speakable le\ els, 
or for such ‘feelings’, ‘impulses’, ‘tendencies’. As in human life, ive 
deal with many orders of abstractions, we could say in an ordinal lan- 
guage that identification originates or results in the confusion of orders 
of abstractions This conclusion may assume different forms' one repre- 
sented by the identification of the scientific object or the event with tlie 
ordinary object, which may be called ignorance, pathological to man; 
another, the identification of the objective levels with the verbal levels, 
which I call objectification, a third, the identification of descriptions with 



406 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


inferences, which I call confusion of higher order abstraetinns In the 
latter case, \\ e should notice that inferences involve usually more intense 
semantic components, such as ‘opinions’, ‘beliefs’, ‘wishes’. , than descrip- 
tions These inferences may have a definite, objective, un-speakable 
character and may represent, then, a semantic state which is not words, 
and so objectifications of higher order may be produced 

When we introduce the ordinal language, we should notice that under 
known conditions we deal w'lth an ordered natural series , namely, events 
first, object next; object first, label next, description first, inferences 
next, This order expresses the natural importance, giving us the 
natural base for evaluation and so for our natural human sr If we 
identify two different orders, by necessity, w'e evaluate them equally, 
which always involves errors, resulting potentially in semantic shocks 
As we deal in life with an established natural order of values which can 
be expressed, for my purpose, by a series decreasing in value : events or 
scientific objects, ordinary objects, labels, descriptions, inferences , 
identification results in a very curious semantic situation 

Let us assume that the scientifically established value of any level 
could be expressed as 100, and the value of the next as 1. With the con- 
sciousness of abstracting we could not disregard, nor identify, these 
values, nor forget that 100 >1 If we confuse the orders of abstrac- 
tions, this can be expressed as the identification m value and we have 
a semantic equation- (1) 100= 100, or (2) 1 = 1, or any other num- 
ber, say (3) 50 = SO 

As we deal fundamentally with a natural, directed inequality, say, 
100 > 1, and, under some semantic pressure, ‘want’, ‘wishful thinking’, 
or Ignorance, or lack of consciousness of abstracting, or ‘mental’ ill- 
ness , we identified the two in value, we produce m the first and third 
cases an owr-evaluation on the right-hand side, and, in the second and 
third cases, an Miider-evaluation on the left-hand side. Thus, on the 
semantic level, any identification of essentially different in value differ- 
ent orders of abstractions, appears as the reversal of the natural order 
of evaluation, with different degrees of intensity If the natural order 
of scientific e\aluation would be 100 > 1, and we would evaluate 
through identification as 2 = 2, or 3 = 3 , 50 = 50 . , 100 = 100, we 
would be ascribing twice, or three times, or fifty times, or a hundred 
times , more delusional values to the right-hand side and under-evaluate 
the left-hand side, than the natural order of evaluation would require 
Nature exhibits, in my language and in this field, an asymmetrical rela- 
tion of ‘more', or ‘less’ inaccessible to A procedure Under the influence 
of anstotelianism, when, through identification, we ascribe to nature 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


407 


delusional values, adjustment becomes very difficult, particularly under 
modern complex life-conditions 

The above example indicates the degrees of intensity which we find 
in life in the reversal of the natural order of evaluation through iden- 
tification, produced by, and resulting in, the lack of consciousness of 
abstracting Un-sanity, which affects practically all of us, represents the 
reversal of lesser intensity , the reversal of greater intensity — the more 
advanced ‘mental’ ills. 

We should realize that experimentally we find in this field a fun- 
damental difference in value, which, on semantic levels, can be expressed 
as an asymmetrical relation of ‘more’ or ‘less’, establishing some natural 
order. If any one should claim a natural ‘identity’, the burden of proof 
falls on him. If ‘absolute sameness in all respects’ cannot be found in 
this world, then such a notion appears as false to facts, and becomes a 
structural falsification, preventing sanity and adjustment If he accepts 
the fundamental, natural differences in value, but prefers to assume a 
different order of evaluation depending on his metaphysics, be it the 
elementahstic materialism, or equally elementalistic idealism, the seman- 
tic results are not changed, because identification in the second case 
would also ascribe delusional identity to essentially different orders of 
abstractions. It should be noticed that the A formulation applies equally 
to the older different, opposite doctrines and renders them illegitimate 
on similar grounds 

The status of the event, or the scientific object, is slightly more 
complex, because the event is described at each date by very reliable, 
constantly revised and tested, hypothetical, structural, inferential terms, 
exhibiting the peculiar circularity of human knowledge If we should 
treat these inferential structures, not as hypothetical, hut should identify 
them semantically with the eventual processes on the level of the su1> 
microscopic event, we would have semantic disturbances of identification 

I have selected the above given order, not only for convenience and 
simplicity, but because of its experimental character When we identify 
in values, we always exhibit in our s r the reversed natural order, intro- 
duced here on space-time structural and evaluational grounds 

The above analysis represents a very rough outline, but is sufficient 
for my purpose Any attentive and informed reader can cany it further 
as far as desired. The mam point appears that different orders of ab- 
stractions exhibit different characteristics, and so any identification of 
entities essentially different in one or more aspects must introduce delu- 
sional semantic factors I speak mostly about evaluation, because evalu- 
ation appears experimentally as an essential factor in all sr and can be 



408 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


applied even profitably in those cases of ‘mental’ illness where no definite 
evaluation appears, the absence of evaluation being a form of evaluation 
(i;i o) In training, it is of utmost importance to eliminate identification 
entirely, which mvariahly appears as a delusional semantic factor To 
achieve these ends, all and every available means should be employed. 

When one studies carefully the older disciplines, one is amazed 
to learn to what an extent the recorded 'thinkers' rebelled against the 
limitations and insufficiencies of anstotelianism, which system, naturally, 
became antiquated a short tune after its formulation. One is amazed 
to find that 'everything has already been said’, and that, to a large extent, 
these important, separated statements were inoperative. It is of little 
importance that some ‘wise statements’ had been made by some one, 
somewhere, if they had no influence on the great masses of the race. 
The reason for this tremendous public waste of private efforts is that 
anstotelianism, with its further elaborations and its delusional identi- 
fication, eleinentahsm . , represents a co-ordinated system which moulded 
our sr, languages, and institutions, and which influenced every phase 
of our lives Under such conditions, isolated doctrines, no matter how 
wise, become powerless in the face of such a system, or, more correctly, 
a system of interlocked systems Only a revision of the system and the 
tentative formulation of a H-system can make many older fundamental 
clarifications workable, which, although known to a few specialists, 
appear generally unknown to the great masses and unavailable m ele- 
mentary education, which alone can be generally effective One is also 
amazed at the power of structurally correct terminology, and feels full 
of sympathy toward the primitive interpretation as the ‘magic of 
words’' Happy, structural high abstractions really have a strong cre- 
ative character Since, for instance, the principle of ‘least action’, or the 
‘general principle of relativity’ (the theory of the absolute) , have been 
formulated, all of our structural knowledge has been recast, clarified, 
and we constantly hear of some remarkable applications of the new 
knowledge Similarly, if it is pointed out that our mam private and 
public difficulties are due to infantilism produced by ‘anstotelianism’, m 
general, and, in particular, by identification and eleinentahsm, w'e at 
once have practical means for a revision and applications In such a 
first and novel attempt over-subtlety is impossible and even not desir- 
able It IS preferable, as well as expedient, to formulate the general 
outline and, thereby, draw more men into the work for the details 

For thousands of years, millions upon millions of humans have 
used a great deal of their nervous energy in worrying upon delusional 
questions, forced upon them by the pernicious ‘is’ of identity, such as : 



ON THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIAL 


409 


‘What IS an object^’, ‘What is life?’, ‘What is hell?’, ‘What ts heaven?’, 
‘What ts space ?’ ‘What is time ?’, and an endless array of such irritants 
The answer, based on the human discrimination of orders of abstractions 
and so proper human evaluation, is definite, undeniable, simple, and 
unique ‘Whatever one might say something “is", it is not ’ Whatever 
we might say belongs to the verbal level and not to the un-speakable, 
objective levels. 

Let me repeat once more that the ‘is’ of identity forces us into 
semantic disturbances of wrong evaluation We establish, foi instance, 
the identity of the un-speakable objective level with words, which, once 
stated, becomes obviously false to facts The ‘is’ of identity, if used as 
indicating ‘identity’ (structurally impossible on the objective levels), 
says nothing Thus, the question, ‘What is an object ?’, may be answered, 
‘An object ts an object’ — a statement which says nothing If used in 
definitions or classifications, such as ‘Smith is a man’, a type of state- 
ment used even in the Principia Mathematica, or ‘A is B or not B’, as 
in the formulation of the law of ‘excluded third’ in the two-valued A 
‘logic’. It always establishes an identity, false to facts The first state- 
ment expresses the identity of a proper name with a class name which 
must lead to the confusion of classes (higher order abstractions) with 
individuals (lower order abstractions) This confusion leads automati- 
cally to disturbed evaluation m life, because the characteristics of a class 
are not the ‘same’ as, nor identical w'lth, the characteristics of the indi- 
vidual I shall not analjse m detail the ‘A is B’, because, obviously, it 
ts not. 

How about Fido? Fido has no science and, therefore, no ‘event’ 
For him, the object is not an abstraction of some older, but ‘is all' he 
‘knows’ and cares about Smith not only abstracts m indefinite numbers 
of different orders, and does it automatically and habitually, but if he 
^ enquires he may also become conscious of abstracting — 'is not all’, and 
'this IS not this' Now, Fido can never be conscious of abstracting, as 
his nervous system is incapable of being extended by extra-neural 
means, and this extension appears to be a necessary condition for the 
acquiring of consciousness of abstracting 

Although for Smith, ‘This ts not this’, as illustrated on the Struc- 
tural Differential, for Fido, that diagram would eventually mean ‘this is 
tins’, the structure of his world being represented by the single disk (0„) 
Fido cannot be conscious of abstracting, he must identify, because he 
‘knows’ nothing of this process, and there is no means of informing him 
of these relations and structure

THE MECH-\XISM OF TIME-BIXDIXG 


If we are not conscious of abstracting, we must identity — ^in other 
words, wheneter we contuse the different orders of abstractions, un- 
avoidable it 'Ae Uie the bs* of identity, we duplicate or copy the amma! 
way of ‘thinking’, v.dth similar ‘emotional’ responses. In the following 
chapters, this tragedy will be explained in detail, and it wilt be shown 
that firactically all human difficulties inv'jhe this semanuc factor of 
copi'ing animals in our nervous reactions and ei aluation as a component. 

A theoiy- which not only throws light on this serious problem, but 
which also gi'.es means of replacing the nld h.amiful j; b\- more bene- 
ficial ones, may be iL-eful. in spite of ’.-annus remporaiy- difficulties which 
are due to the old identiti -reactions and the lack of familiarits- with, 
the new. 

The old identitj. -reactions are e>.tremely ingrained, particularb with 
grown-ups Serious effort and permanent reminde’rs are necessary to 
overconie them. The Structural Differential represents such a structural 
visual reminder, which we shnuid keep constantly before cur eyes until 
the pemiaous diDturbances of evaluation have been overcome For 
Smith, the fundamental evaluation can be expressed in simple and quite 
primitive language — "This is not this’. 

The above most vital semantic factors of evaluation indispensable 
for adjustment and sanity are conveyed to him whenever he looks 
at the stratification indicated on the Differential The hanging free 
strings indicating the non-ahstracted characteristics tram his 5.r to be 
aware of the non-allness of. and the lack of identity between, his 
abstractions 

Our old s r were similar to Fido s , w e were never jully conscious 
of abstracting. Through wrong evaluation ve identified what is inher- 
ently different and longed for, or assumed some impossible ‘allness’ in 
our ‘knowings’ 

Practice has shown me. definitelv that to acquire these new reac- 
tions of consciousness of abstracting is difficult and requires ‘time’ and 
effort to accomplish, in spite of the exceptional, nearlv’ primitive, sim- 
plicity of the means employed The ‘silence on the objectiv-e levels’ 
sounds v-erv- innocent, )'et it is extremely difficult to acquire, as it in- 
volves a complete checking of all semantic disturbances, identifications, 
confusions of orders of abstractions, habitual ‘emotions’, ‘preconceived 
ideas’ , practically impossible without the use of the objective Differen- 
tial to which we can point our finger and be silent, to begin with In 
fact, to disregard this point, actually means failure m accomplishing the 
desired semantic results. At present, as far as experience has gone, the 
main results were achieved when a given individual had conquered this

first, simple, and obvious semantic obstacle If the simple rules and 
conditions given in the present system for abolishing identification are 
followed persistently in the tiaimng with the Differential, a complete 
and very beneficial structural and semantic change in the character and 
‘mental’ capacities of a given individual occurs, seemingly all out of pro- 
portion with the simplicity of the training But if we consider the con- 
tent of all knowledge as uniquely structural, and if the majority of us 
are semantically tied up, blocked, with antiquated, animalistic, primitn e, 
infant-like, ‘mentally’-ill and A structure and identity-reactions, owing 
to the lack of consciousness of abstracting, which ue renounce in toto 
by acquiring the consciousness of abstracting, such remarkable trans- 
formation becomes intelligible 

The publication of the Structural Differential in separate, con- 
veniently large copies has been forced upon me by e'qierience and by 
various difficulties found in the re-educating of our s r, without which 
a /?-system, adjustment, sanity, and all the desirable results which depend 
on them, are impossible

But a felt 'contrarj'’ is conscjousness in germ. . . . Consciousness re- 
quires more than the mere entertainment of theory. It is the feeling of

A language, to be most useful, should be similar in its structure to 
the structure of the events which it is supposed to represent The lan- 
guage of ‘abstractions of different orders’ appears to be satisfactory in 
point of structure It is a non-el language, since it does not discriminate 
between ‘senses' and ‘mind’, It is a functional language, since it de- 
scribes, by implication, what is going on in the nervous system when it 
reacts to stimuli It is a language which can be made as flexible and as 
sharp as desired, thus making it possible to establish sharp verbal differ- 
ences, of both horizontal and vertical type, between the tenns ‘man’ 
and ‘animal’ 

The last semantic characteristic of potential sharpness is extremely 
important for a theory of sanity Evidence of 1933 leads us to conclude 
that, under the influence of external stimuli, the most primitne and 
simplest forms of life were moulded, transformed, and influenced m the 
process of survival, and, therefore, of adjustment In this way, more 
and more complex structures evolved It should be emphasized that 
organisms represent functional units, and that an additive change in 
structure does not necessarily involve a simply additive change in func- 
tion By ph} sico-chemical, structural, colloidal necessity the organism 
w'orks as-a-wholc Being a relative w^hole, any additive structural factor 
becomes a reactive and functional factor which influences the working 
of the whole This is, perhaps, best illustrated by the boy who was born 
without a cortex, but with no other obvious defects He was incom- 
parably more helpless and unadjusted than animals who have no cortex, 
or even no nervous system at all Although we could speak in additive 
terms of the difference between this boy and a normal boy, as one having 
no cortex and the other ‘plus a cortex’, yet the functioning was so differ- 
ent as not to be expressible in a ‘plus’ language. 

Similar remarks could be generalized to all life We must be very 
careful in building sharp distinctions, since the anatomical differences 
alone are unreliable If we want to have more reliable differences, we 
should look for functional differences. 

412 



CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRACTING

We have already discovered functional differences that are ex- 
pressed by the horizontal and by the vertical differences between the 
abstracting capacities of Smith and Fido. The analysis of these differ- 
ences IS the subject of the present chapter. 

‘Thought’ represents a reaction of the organism-as-a- whole, pro- 
duced by the working of the whole, and influencing the whole From 
our daily experience, we are familiar with what we usually denote as 
being ‘conscious’, in other words, we are aware of something, be it an 
object, a process, an action, a ‘feeling’, or an ‘idea’ A reaction that is 
very habitual and semi-automatic is not necessarily ‘consaous’. The term 
‘consciousness’, taken separately, is not a complete symbol , it lacks con- 
tent, and one of the characteristics of ‘consciousness’ is to have some 
content Usually, the term ‘consciousness’ is taken as undefined and 
undefinablej because of its immediate character for every one of us 
Such a situation is not desirable, as it is always semantically useful to 
try to define a complex term by simpler terms We may limit the general 
and undefined term ‘consciousness’ and make it a definite symbol by the 
deliberate ascribing of some content to this term For this ‘consciousness 
of something’ I take ‘consciousness of abstracting’ as fundamental. Per- 
haps the only type of meanings the term ‘consciousness’ has is covered 
by the functional term ‘consciousness of abstracting’, which represents 
a general process going on in our nervous system Even if this is not 
the only type of meanings, the term ‘consciousness of abstracting’ ap- 
pears to be of such crucial semantic importance that its introduction is 
necessary 

The term ‘consciousness’, because of its hitherto undefined and 
traditionally undefinable character, did not allow us further analysis. 
Neither did we have any workable, educational, semantic means to handle 
the vast field of psycho-logical processes which this incomplete symbol 
indicated If we now select the term ‘consciousness of abstracting’ as 
fundamental, we not only make the last symbol complete by assigning 
functional content to it, but we also find means to define it more spe- 
cifically in simpler terms Through understanding of the processes we 
gam educational means of handling and influencing a large group of 
semantic psycho-logical reactions. 

Let us analyse this new term by aid of the diagram called the Struc- 
tural Differential referred to m the previous chapter Here the object 
(Oa) represents a nervous abstraction of a low order In this abstract- 
ing, some characteristics of the event were missed or not abstracted, 
these are indicated by the not connected lines (B') When we abstracted 
from our obj'ect further, by coming a definition or ascribing ‘meanings’ 



414 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


to the label (L), again we did not aLbUacl ‘all’ the characteristics of the 
object into the definition , but some characteristics were left out, as indi- 
cated by the lines (B") In other words, the number of characteristics 

which we ascribe to the 
label, by some process of 
‘knowing’, or ‘wanting’, or 
‘needing’, or ‘interest’ , 
does rot cover the number 
of characteristics the oh- 
j'ect has The ‘obj'ect’ has 
more characteristics than 
we can include in the ex- 
plicit or implicit definition 
of the label for the ‘ob- 
ject’ Besides, the defini- 
tion (implicit or e-vplicif) 
of the ‘object’ is not the 
object itself, which always 
holds many surprises for 
us The latter has the 'in- 
dividuality of the object’, 
as we may call it Every 
one who uses a car, or a 
gun, or a typewriter, or 
who has had a number of 
wives, or husbands, or 
children, knows that well 
In spite of the fact that 
these objects are, to a large 
extent, standardized, every 
individual object has indi- 
vidual peculiarities With 
modern methods of physi- 
cal, chemical, and astro- 
nomical investigation, scientists find that ei en their special materials and 
equipments have also peculiar individualities which must be taken into 
account in the more refined researches 

If we take any ordinary object and expect to find such and such 
characteristics, ascribed to the objects by definition, we may be disap- 
pointed As a rule, we find or can find, if our analysis is subtle enough, 
these peculiar individualities The reader can easily convince himself 




CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRACTING 


415 


by looking over a box of matches, and by noticing the peculiar individu- 
ality of each match But smca, by definition, we expect that when we 
strike a match it should ignite, we may disregard all other characteristics 
as irrelevant for our purpose A similar process is at woik m other 
phases of life We often live, feel happy or unhappy, by what actually 
amounts to a dcRmtion, and not by the empirical, individual facts less 
coloured by semantic factors When Smithi marries Smiths, they mostly 
do so by a kind of definition They have certain notions as to what ‘man’, 
‘woman’, and ‘marriage’ ‘are’ by dehnition They actually go through 
the performance and find that the Smithi and his wife. Smiths, have 
unexpected likes, dislikes, and particularities — m general, characteristic 
and semantic reactions not uicliided in their definition of the terms ‘man’, 
‘woman’, ‘husband’, ‘wife’, or ‘marriage’ Characteristics ‘left out’ m the 
definitions make their appearance ‘Disappointments’ accumulate, and a 
more or less unhappy life begins 

The above analysis applies to all phases of human life, and appears 
entirely general because of the structure of ‘human knowledge’ Charac- 
teristics are discovered when it is loo late The not knoivmg or the for- 
getting of the relations explained above does the semantic havoc On 
verbal, ‘definitional’, or doctrinal semantic grounds, we expect something 
else than what the experiences of life give us The non-fulfillment of 
expectation produces a serious affective and semantic shock If such 
shocks are repeated again and again, they disorganize the normal work- 
ing of the nervous system, and often lead to pathological states An 
indefinitely large number of experimental facts fully supports the above 
conclusions Many of them have been supplied during the World War. 
Curiously enough, when the soldier did expect horrors, and later experi- 
enced them, he seldom became deranged ‘mentally’ If he did not fully 
expect them, and yet had to experience them, he often broke down 
nervously 

The attack of hay fever at the sight of paper roses, referred to 
already, gives a similar semantic example The attack followed from the 
semantic 'definition' of ‘roses’, of ‘hay fever’, and from the situation 
as-a-whole, and was not due to inspection of the objective ‘roses’, or to 
the physico-chemical action of the ‘roses’ If the patient had been blind- 
folded when the paper ‘roses’ were brought into his presence, no attack 
would have occurred 

' We are now ready to define ‘consciousness of abstracting’ in simpler 
terms j namely, in terms of ‘memory’ The term ‘memory’ is structurally 
a physico-chemical term It implies that the events are interconnected. 



416 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


that everything in this world influences everything else, and that hap- 
penings leave some traces somewhere 

A similar analysis can be carried on in connection with the object 
and the event Briefly, the object represents structurally an abstraction 
of some order, does not, and cannot, include all the characteristics of the 
event , and so, again, we have some characteristics left out as indicated 
by the lines (B') 

Here we have the possibility of making a series of most general, 
and yet entirely true, negative statements of great semantic importance , 
that the label is not the object, and that the object ts not the event , For 
the number of mo characteristics which we ascribe to the label by 
definition does not cover all the characteristics we recognize in the ob- 
ject, and the number of characteristics which we perceive in the object 
IS also not equal to the infinite numbers of characteristics the event has 
The differences are still more profound Not only do the numbers of 
J7i o characteristics differ, but also the character of these abstractions 
differs from level to level of the successive abstractions 

We can now define 'consciousness of abstracting’ as 'awareness that 
in our process of abstracting we have left out characteristics’ Or, con- 
sciousness of abstracting can be defined as 'remembering the "is not”, 
and that some characteristics have been left out’ It should be noticed 
that in this formulation, with the aid of the Structural Differential, we 
have succeeded m translating a negative process of forgetting into a 
positive process of remembering the denial of identity and that charac- 
teristics are left out Such a positive formulation makes the whole sys- 
tem workable and available for the semantic training and education 

The use of the Structural Differential becomes a necessity for any 
one who wants to receive full semantic benefit from the present work 
A book IS, by necessity, verbal Whatever any author can say is verbal, 
and nothing whatsoever can be said which is not verbal It seems entirely 
obvious that m life we deal with an enormous number of things and 
situations, ‘feelings’ , which are not verbal These belong to the ‘objec- 
tive level'. The crucial difficulty is found in the fact that whatever can 
be said is not and cannot be on the objective level, but belongs only to 
the verbal levels This difference, being inexpressible by words, cannot 
be expressed by w'ords We must have other means to indicate this dif- 
ference We must show with our hand, by pointing our finger to the 
object, and by being silent outwardly as well as inwardly, which silence 
we may indicate by closing our lips with the other hand The verbal 
denial of the ‘is’ of identity covers this point also when shown on the 
Differential If we burst into speech based on the ‘is’ of identity, as we 



CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRACTING 


417 


usually do, we find ourselves obviously on the verbal levels indicated 
by the labels L, Li, Lz, L,„ but never on the objective level (Oj) 
On this last level, we can look, handle , but must be silent. The reason 
that we nearly all identify the two levels is that it is impossible to train 
an individual in this semantic difference by verbal means alone, as all 
verbal means belong to the levels of labels and never to the objective un- 
speakable levels With a visual and tactile actual object and labels on 
the Structural Differential, to point our finger at, handle , we now have 
simple means to convey the tremendously important semantic difference 
and tram m non-identity 

We should notice that the consciousness of abstracting, or the 
remembering that we abstract in different orders with omission of char- 
acteristics, depends on the denial of the 'is’ of identity and is connected 
with limitations or ‘non-allness’, so characteristic of the new non-systems 

The consciousness of abstracting eliminates automatically identifica- 
tion or ‘confusion of the orders of abstractions’, both applying to the 
semantic confusion on all levels If we are not conscious of abstracting, 
we are bound to identify or confuse the object with its finite number 
of characteristics, with the event, with its infinite numbers of different 
characteristics Confusion of these levels may misguide us into semantic 
situations ending in unpleasant shocks If we acquire the consciousness 
of abstracting, and remember that the object is not the event and that 
we have abstracted characteristics fewer than, and different from, those 
the event has, we should expect many unforeseen happenings to occur 
Consequently, when the unexpected happens, we are saved from painful 
and harmfureemantic shocks 

If, through lack of consciousness of abstracting, we identify or con- 
fuse words with objects and feelings, or memories and ‘ideas’ with 
experiences which belong to the un-speakable objective level, we iden- 
tify higher order abstractions with lower Since this special type of 
semantic identification or confusion is extremely general, it deserves a 
special name I call it objectification, because it is generally the confusion 
of words or verbal issues (memories, ‘ideas’ ,) with objective, un-speak- 
able levels, such as objects, or experiences, or feelings , If we objectify, 
we forget, or we do not remember that words are not the objects or 
feelings themselves, that the verbal levels are always different from the 
objective levels When we identify them, we disregard the inherent 
differences, and so proper evaluation and full adjustment become im- 
possible 

Similar semantic difficulties arise from the confusion of higher 
order abstractions, for instance, the identification of inferences with

descriptions This may be made clearer by examples In studying these 
examples, it should be remembered that the organism acts as-a-whole, 
and that ‘emotional’ factors are, therefore, always present and should 
not be disregarded In this study, the reader should try to put himself 
‘emotionally’ m the place of the Smith we speak about, then he cannot 
fail to understand the serious semantic disturbances these identifications 
create m everybody’s life 

Let us begin with a Smith who knows nothing of what has been 
said here, and who is not conscious of abstracting For him, as well as 
for Fido, there is, in principle, no realization of the ‘characteristics left 
out’ He IS ‘emotionally’ convinced that his words entirely cover the 
‘object’ which ‘is so and so’ He identifies his lower abstractions with 
characteristics left out, with higher abstractions which have all char- 
acteristics included He ascribes to words an entirely false value 
and certitude which they cannot have He does not realize that his 
words may have different meanings for the other fellow He ascribes 
to words ‘emotional’ objectivity and value, and the verbal, A ‘perma- 
nence’, ‘definiteness’, ‘one-value’ , to objects. When he hears something 
that he does not like, he does not ask ‘what do you mean^’, but, under 
the semantic pressure of identification, he ascribes his own meanings 
to the other fellow’s words For him, words ‘are’ ‘emotionally’ over- 
loaded, objectified semantic fetishes, even as to the piimitive man who 
believed in the ‘magic of words’ Upon hearing anything strange, his s r 
IS undelayed and may appear as, ‘I disagree w'lth you’, or ‘I don’t believe 
you’. There is no reason to be dramatic about any unwelcome statement 
One needs definitions and interpretations of such stateifienls, which 
probably are correct from the speaker’s point of view, if we grant him 
his informations, his undefined terms, the structure of his language and 
premises which build up his j r But our Smith, innocent of the ‘struc- 
ture of human knowledge’, has mostly a semantic belief in the one-value, 
absoluteness , of things, and thmghood of words, and does not know, 
or does not remember, that words arc not the events themselves Words 
represent higher order abstractions manufactured by higher nerve cen- 
tres, and objects represent lower order abstractions manufactured by 
lower nerve centres Under such ideiility-delustons, he becomes an abso- 
lutist, a dogmatist, a finalist, He seeks to establish ‘ultimate truths’, 
‘eternal verities’ , and is willing to fight for them, never knowing or 
remembering, otherwise forgetting, the ‘characteristics left out’ , never 
recognizing that the noises he makes aie not the objective actualities we 
deal with If somebody contradicts him, he is much disturbed Forgetting 
characteristics left out, he is always ‘right’ For him his statement is not 



CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRACTING 


419 


only the only statement possible, but he actually attributes some cosmic 
objective evaluation to it 

The above description is unsatisfactory, but cannot be much im- 
proved upon, since the situation involves unspeakable affective com- 
ponents which are not words We must simply try to put ourselves m 
his place, and to live through his experiences when he identifies and 
believes without question that his -words ‘are’ the things they only stand 
for To give the full consequences of such identification resulting m 
wrong evaluation, I might add most tedious descriptions of the interplay 
of situations, evaluations , m quarrels, unhappinesses, disagreements , 
leading to dramas and tragedies, as well as to many forms of ‘mental’ 
illness effectively described only in the belles-lettres Thus, Smithi, who 
IS not conscious of abstracting, makes the statement, 'A circle is not 
square’ Let us suppose that Browni contradicts him Smithi is angered , 
for his jr, his statement ‘is’ the ‘plain truth’, and Brownj must be a fool. 
He objectifies it, ascribes to it undue value For him, it ‘is’ ‘experience’, 
a ‘fact’ , and he bursts into speech, denouncing Browni and showing 
how wrong he ‘is’ From this semantic attitude, many difficulties and 
tragedies arise 

But if Smiths (conscious of abstracting) makes the statement, ‘A 
circle IS not square’, and Browns contradicts him, what would Smiths do? 
He would smile, would not burst into speech to defend Ins statement, 
but would ask Browns, ‘What do you mean ? I do not quite understand 
you’ After receiving some answer. Smiths w ould explain to Brow ns that 
his statement is not anything to quarrel about, as it is verbal and is true 
only by deh.'iitwn He would also grant the right of Browns not to 
accept Ins definition, but to use another one to satisfy himself The 
problem would then, naturally, arise as to what definition both could 
accept, or which would be generally acceptable And the problem w'ould 
then be solved by purely pragmatic considerations Words appear as 
creatures of definitions, and optional , but this attitude mvoh es important 
and new j r 

This fact seems of tremendous semantic importance, as it provides 
the working foundation for a theory of ‘universal agreement’ In the 
first part of the above example. Smith,, according to the accepted stan- 
dards, w'as ‘right’ (‘a circle is not square’) Is he ‘more right’ than 
Brown,, for whom the ‘circle is square’’ Not at all Both statements 
belong to the verbal level, and represent only forms of representation 
for j r inside their skin Either may be ‘right’ by some explicit or im- 
plicit ‘definitions’ Are the two statements equally valid ? This we do not 
knoiv a priori, we must investigate to find out if the noises uttered have 



420 VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


meanings outside of patholng}', or which statement structurally covers 
the situation better, carries us structurally further in describing and 
anal> sing this u orld , . Only scientific structural analysis can give the 
preference to one fonn oier another Smith and Brown can only pro- 
duce their ‘definitions’ according to their jr, but they are not judges as to 
which ‘definitions’ will ultimately stand the test of structure 

The moment ue eliminate identification we become conscious of 
abstracting, and permanently and instinctively remember that the object 
IS not the eient that the label is not the object, and that a statement 
about a statement is not the first statement, thus, we reach a semantic 
state, uhere we recognize that e\er\body ‘is right’ by his own ‘defini- 
tions’ But any indmdual or unenlightened public opinion is not the 
sole judge as to what ‘definitions’ and what language should prevail. 
Only structural in\ estigation (science) can decide which appears as the 
structurally more similar form of representation on the verbal levels 
for what is going on on the un-speakable, objective levels 

When It comes to ‘description of facts’, the situation is not funda- 
mentally altered Mistakes seem always possible and often occur Be- 
sides. the semantic impressions which ‘facts’ make on us are also indi- 
vidual, and often in conflict, as comparison of the testimonies of 
eye-witnesses shows But there is no need for permanent disagreement , 
more structural investigation of the objective and verbal levels will pro- 
vide a solution Once such an investigation is carried far enough, we 
can always reach a semantic basis where all may agree, provided we do 
not identify, do not objectify, and do not confuse description and infer- 
ence, descriptive and inferential words , 

As our anal} sis is carried out from the structural and non-el point 
of view, we should not miss the fact that semantic components asso- 
ciated with words and statements are, outside of very pathological cases, 
never entirely absent, and become of paramount importance In the older 
days, we had no simple and effective means by which we could affect 
painful, misplaced, or disproportionate evaluations, meanings , through 
a semantic re-education, which are supplied by the present analysis and 
the use of the Structural Differential The means to eliminate identifica- 
tion consist of first, an objective relief diagram to which we can point 
our Unger, and second, a convincing explanation (pointing the finger to 
the labels) that the verbal levels, with their distressing and disastrous 
older sr, are not, and differ entirely from, the levels of objects and 
events Whatever we may say or feel, the objects and events remain on 
the un-speakable levels and cannot be reached by words Under such 
natural structural conditions, we can only reach the objective level by 



CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRACTING 


421 


seeing, handling, actually feeling , and, therefore, by pointing our finger 
to the object on the Structural Differential and being silent — all of which 
cannot be conveyed by words alone 

In experiments with the ‘mentally’ ill m whom the semantic disturb- 
ances were very strong, it took several months to tram the patients in 
non-identity and in silence on the objective levels But, as soon as this 
was achieved, either complete or partial relief followed 

The mam disturbances m daily life, as well as in ‘mental’ illness, 
are found m the affective field We find an internal pressure of identi- 
fications, expressed by bursting into speech, and unjustified semantic 
over-evaluation of words, the ascribing of objectivity to words,. In 
such cases, suppression or repression of words does not accomplish much, 
but often does considerable harm and must be avoided by all means 
Under such conditions, the use of the relief diagram becomes a neces- 
sity m pointing to the difference between different orders of abstractions 
and inducing the semantically beneficial silence on the ‘objectne level' 
without repression or suppression 

With the use of the Structural Differential, we can eliminate iden- 
tification, and so attain the benefits, avoiding the dangers If any one 
identifies, and his s r drive him into an outburst of speech, we do not 
repress or suppress him, we say, instead ‘At your pleasure [since it 
makes him feel better], but remember that your woids occur on the 
verbal levels [showing with a gesture of the hands the hanging labels], 
and that they are not the objective level, which remains untouched and 
unchanged’ Such a procedure, when repeated again and again, gives 
him the proper semantic evaluation of otdcrs of abstractions, frees him 
from identification, yet without repression or suppression It teaches 
him, also, to enquire into alleged ‘facts’, and then to try to find struc- 
turally better forms of representation If such results are not forth- 
coming, we may use the older forms, but by proper evaluation we do 
not semantically put ‘belief’ m these forms of repi escntation Such 
beliefs always appear as the result of identification somewhere 

The technique of training is simple We live on the ‘objective’ or 
lower order of abstraction levels, where we must see, feel, touch, per- 
form , but never speak In training, we must use our hands , It is very 
useful, after the Structural Differential has been repeatedly explained, 
stressing, in particular, the rejection of the ‘is’ of identity, not to inter- 
rupt the other fellow Let him speak, but wave the hand, indicating the 
verbal levels, then point the finger to the objective level, and, with the 
other hand, close your own lips, to show that on the objective level one 
can only be silent When performed repeatedly, this pantomime has a

most beneficial, semantic, pacifying effect upon the ‘o\er-emotionalized’ 
identification-conditions The neurological mechanism of this action is 
not fully know n, but some aspects are quite clear 

The more elaborate a nervous system becomes, the further some 
parts of the brain are removed from immediate experience Nerve cur- 
rents, having finite \ elocity, eventually have longer and more numerous 
paths to trai el , different possibilities and complications arise, resulting in 
‘delayed action’ It is known that the thalamus (roughly) appears con- 
nected with affective and ‘emotional’ life, and that the cortex, farther 
removed and isolated from the external world, has the effect of inducing 
this delay in action' In unbalanced and ‘emotional’ ‘thinking’, w'hich is 
so prevalent, the thalamus seems overworked, the cortex seems not 
w'orked enough The results take on the form of a low' kind of animal- 
istic, primitive, or infantile behaviour, often of a pathological character 
111 a supposedly civilized adult It appears that the ‘silence on objectiie 
levels’ introduces this ‘delayed action’, unloading the thalamic material 
on the cortex This psvchoplnsiological method is very simple, scientific, 
and entirely general The standard ‘mental’ therapy of today applies 
also a method of re-cducafion of sr, as if relieving the thalamus, and 
putting more of the nene currents through the cortex, or eventualh 
furnishing the cortex with different material, so that the thalamic ma- 
terial returning from the cortex could be properly influenced 

If we succeed in such a semantic re-education, the difficulties vanish 
The older experimental data show that in many instances we have suc- 
ceeded, and that in many w'e have failed The successful cases show that 
w'e actually know' the essential semantic points involved, the failures 
show' that we do not know enough, and that our older theories are not 
sufficiently general At present, only the more pronounced and morbid 
semantic disturbances come to the attention of physicians, and ver}’ little 
IS done by way of picveiitive measures Besides the pronounced disturb- 
ances in daily life, we see an enormous number of semantic disturbances 
which we disregard, and call ‘peculiarities’ In the majority of cases, 
these ‘peculiarities' are undesirable, and, under unfavorable conditions, 
may lead to more serious consequences of a morbid character They 
usually iniolve a great deal of unhappiness for all concerned, and un- 
happiness appears as a sign of some semantic maladjustment somewhere, 
and so may be destructive to ‘mental' and nervous health 

In advanced ‘mental’ illnesses, such as usually come to the attention 
of psychiatrists, there are certain psycho-logical sj'inptoms which are 
generally present The s> mptoms of interest to us in this work are called 
‘delusions’, ‘illusions’, and ‘hallucinations’ All of them involve the

semantic identification or confiiswns of the orders of abstractions, the 
evaluation of lower orders of abstraction as higher, or higher as lower 
It was explained already that some components of identification are in- 
variably present there, and so identification may be considered as an 
elementary type of semantic disturbances from which all the other states 
differ only in intensity. 

The mam point is to find psychophysiological preventive means 
whereby this identification can be forestalled or eliminated To date, 
experience and anal} sis show' that all forms of identification may be suc- 
cessfully eliminated by training m visualisation, if this semantic state 
can be produced For this purpose the Structural Differential is uniquely 
useful and necessary With its help we tram all centres The lower 
centres are involved, as we see, feel, hear , the higher centres are equally 
involved, as we ‘remember’, ‘understand’ , with the result that all centres 
work together without conflict The ‘consciousness of abstracting’ is 
inculcated, replacing vicious jr of confusion of orders of absti actions 
and identification 

This harmonious working of all centres on their proper levels has 
extremely far-reaching, practical consequences in ‘mental’ and ph}sical 
hygiene We become co-ordinated, adjusted, and difficulties which might 
otherwise occur in the future are eliminated in a preventive way It 
ijiust be remembered that, at present, it is impossible to foresee to how 
great an extent the elimination of identification on all levels will have a 
beneficial effect At this stage we know even experimentally that the 
benefits are very large, but w'e may expect that they wnll become still 
more numerous when more experimenting has been done Delusions, 
illusions, and hallucinations represent manifestations which occur in prac- 
tically all ‘mental’ difficulties, and they only represent a semantic identi- 
fication of orders of abstractions of diffei ent degrees of intensity When 
this confusion is eliminated, we may expect general changes in the symp- 
toms But as the correspondence is probably not one-to-one, it is im- 
possible to foretell theoretically what improvements may be expected in 
pronounced illness In the slighter disturbances, which affect us in daily 
life, the results are much easier to foresee, and are akoays beneficial 

To how great an extent the consciousness of absti acting benefits 
semantically the whole organism, I may illustrate by one of my own 
expenences Once I was travelling on a ship A gentleman visited my 
cabin, and, seeing the Structural Differential, asked questions about it 
After a short explanation, he asked about practical applications 

My guest was sitting on my berth , I was sitting on a small folding 
chair I got up, went to the door, then pretended that I was coming in. 



424 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


and, at my suggestion, he said, ‘Please ha\ e a seat’ I remained standing 
while explaining how, if I were not ‘consaous of abstracting', to me his 
word ‘seat’ would be identified with the chair (objectification) and mi' 
ST would be such that I would sit down with great confidence If the 
chair were to collapse I would haie, besides the bump, an affective 
shock, ‘fright’ , which might do harm to my neiwous sisteni But if I 
w ere conscious of abstracting, mi’ s r would be different. I i\ ould re- 
member that the mord, the lohcl ‘seat is not the thing on which I am 
supposed to sit I would remember that I am to sit on this individual, 
unique, un-speakable object, which might be strong or weak,. Accord- 
ingly I would sit carefully In case the chair should collapse, ana I 
should hurt mi self pliysicall}-, I would still have been saved an affectiie 
nervous shock 

During all these explanations I was handling the little chair and 
shaking it I did not notice that the legs were falling out, and that the 
chair was becoming unfit for use Then, when I actually sat on the relic, 
it gave way under me HQW'e\er I did r.of fall on the floor. I caught 
myself in the air. so to say, and saved myself from a painful experience 
It IS important to notice that such physical readiness requires a very 
elaborate, nervous, unconscious cn-ordination. which was accomplished 
by the semantic state of non-identificaUon or consciousness of abstract- 
ing. When such a consciousness of abstracting is acquired it works 
instinctnely and automatically and does not require continual effort Its 
operation invohes a fraction of a second's delay in action, but this small 
delay is not harmful in practice . on the contrary it has veiw- important 
ps_t cho-logical and neurological ‘delaved action’ effects 

It seems that ‘silence’ on the objective levels involves this psycho- 
phj'siological delay No matter how small, it serves to unload the thal- 
amic material on the cortex In a number of clinical cases. Dr Philip S. 
Graven has demonstrated that the moment such a delay can actually be 
produced in the patient, he either improves or is entirely relieved The 
precise neurological mechanism of this process is not known, but there is 
no doubt that this ‘delayed action' has many very beneficial effects upon 
the whole w orking of the nert ous s> stem It somehow balances harmful 
s r, and also somehow stimulates the higher nervous centres to more 
physiological control oter the lower centres 

A very vital point in this connection should be noticed That this 
‘delayed action’ is beneficial is acknowledged by the majority of nor- 
mally de% eloped adults m the form of delay in action and finds its 
expression in such statements as ‘think twice’, ‘keep your head’, ‘hold 
your horses’, ‘keep cool’, ‘steady’, ‘wait a minute’. , and such functional

recipes as ‘when angry, count ten’. In daily life, such wisdom is ac- 
quired either by painful experience, or is taught to children in an A 
language, which, as practice shows, is rarely effective because of its 
inadequacy It is seldom realized that the mechanism of these functional 
observations and familiar advices have very powerful and workable 
underlying neurological processes, which can be reached and directly 
affected by psychophysiological, ordinal, non-el methods m connection 
with the structure of the language we use Thus, under an infantile, 
A, and prevailing system we use and teach our children a language 
involving the ‘is’ of identity, and so we must confuse orders of abstrac- 
tions, preparing for ourselves and the children the harmful semantic 
predispositions for ‘bursting into speech’, instead of ‘wait a minute’, 
which, neurologically, means abusing our thalamus and keeping our cor- 
tex ‘unemployed’. In a oo-valued system we reject the ‘is’ of identity , 
we cannot confuse orders of abstractions, we cannot identify words with 
the un-speakable objective levels or inferences with descriptions, and we 
cannot identify the different abstractions of different individuals , This 
semantic state of proper evaluation results in discrimination between the 
different orders of abstractions, an automatic delay is introduced — the 
cortex is switched completely into the nervous circuit The semantic 
foundation is laid for ‘higher mentality’ and ‘emotional balance’ 

We have already had occasion to mention the mechanism of pro- 
jection in connection with identification, as a semantic state of affective 
ascribing of lower centre characteristics to higher order abstractions and 
vice versa, and in connection with the introverted or extroverted attitudes 
Likewise, we have already reached the conclusion that a well-adjusted 
and, therefore, well-balanced individual should be neither of the extremes, 
but a balanced extroverted introvert By training with the Differential 
this important semantic result may be brought about By training with 
the ‘object’ on its level, we become extroverted, and we learn to observe , 
this results in semantic freedom from ‘preconceived ideas’, such as we 
have when we start with the evaluation, label first and object next, in- 
stead of the natural order, object first and label next By passing to 
higher order abstractions and evaluating the successive ranks of labels, 
we tram in introversion The result, as a whole, is that we may achieve 
the desirable and balanced semantic state of the extroverted introvert 
That m the training with the Differential we use all available nerve 
centres is beneficial, because the lower centres are in closer connection 
with the vegetative nervous system than are the others.

The characters tihich science discerns in nature are subtle characters,

In this connection one should particularly remember that the human 
language permits the construction of sentences which do not involve any 
consequences and which therefore have no content at all — in spite of the 
fact that these sentences produce some kind of picture in our imagination , 
e g , the statement that besides our world there evists another w'orld, with 
wmch any connection is impossible in principle, does not lead to any ex- 
perimental consequence, but does produce a kind of picture in the mind. 
Obviously such a statement can neither be proved nor disproved. One 
should be especially careful in using the words “reality," “actually," etc , 
since these words very often lead to statements of the type just mentioned 
(213) W HEISENBERG 


Section A General 

In the previous chapters I demonstrated that there is a short cut 
which enables us to grasp, acquire, and apply what has been adtanced 
in the present work This semantic short cut is 'consciousness of ab- 
stracting’ It IS a psycho-logical attitude toward all our absti acting on 
all levels, and so involves the co-ordinated working of the organism- 
as-a-whole. 

The use of the Structural Differential is necessary, because some 
levels are un-speakable We can see them, handle them, feel them , but 
under no circumstances can we reach those levels by speech alone We 
must, therefore, have a diagram, by preference m relief form, w'hich 
represents the empirical structural conditions, and which indicates the 
un-speakable level by some other means than speech We must, in the 
simplest case, either point our finger to the object, insisting upon silence, 
or must perform bodily some activity and similarly insist upon silence, 
as the performing and feelings are also not words 

In such semantic training it is enough to insist upon the non- 
identity or the difference between the objectne, un-speakable levels of 
lower order abstractions, (O/,), and the verbal or higher order abstrac- 
tions, (L„) When this habit and feeling are acquired, no one should 
have difficulties in extending the non-idcntity method to daih -life occur- 
rences To achieve these semantic aims, we must first emphasize the 
common-sense fact that an object w not the event To do this, we start 
with the 1933 scientific structural ‘metaphysics’ about the event and

stress the fact that the ob- 
ject, being a nervous ab- 
straction of lower order, 
has fewer and different 
m o characteristics than 
the event has This is best 
accomplished by stressing 
the fact that in abstract- 
ing from the event to the 
object we left out some 
characteristics. We did not 
abstract 'all' characteris- 
tics, this would be a self- 
contradiction in terms, an 
impossibility 

We do not even need 
to stress a full understand- 
ing of the event Common- 
sense examples, showing 
that what we recognize as 
a ‘pencil’ is not ‘all’, often 
suffice No one will have 
difficulties, provided he 
trams himself in this di- 
rection, in remembering 
continually and instinc- 
tively the free hanging 
strings (B'), (B"), which 

indicate the non-abstracted „ „

or left-out characteristics 

and which help to tram in non-td entity W ith the relief diagram, the s r 
of the student are trained through all nervous centres He sees, he 
handles , the hanging strings, and he also hears about them This gives 
the maximum probability that the organism-as-a-whole will be affected 
In this way an ‘intellectual’ theory engages the ‘senses’, feelings and 
reflex mechanisms To affect the organism-as-a-whole, organism-as-a- 
whole methods must be employed 

A similar structural situation is found when w'e deal wnth higher 
order abstractions A word, or a name, or a statement is conveyed m 
spoken form or by writing, and affects first the lower centres and then 
IS abstracted, and again transformed, by the higher centres The order

IS generally not changed when the verbal issues are neither seen nor 
heard but originate in oursehes Most ‘impulses’, ‘interests', ‘meanings’, 
‘evaluations’ , originate in lower centres and follow the usual course, 
from lower centres to higher When ‘experience’ (reaction of lower 
centres) is transformed into ‘memories’ (higher centres) , the order is 
similar. Difficulties begin when the order is pathologically reversed and 
‘ideas’ are evaluated as expenence, words as objects , In the building of 
language a similar process can be observed We observe the absolute 
individuals with which we actually deal, w'e label them with individual 
names, say. A,, A.. , A,i, A12, . . jAji, A22, . , A31, A32, , By 

a process of abstracting and disregarding, for instance, the characteristic 
subscripts ‘1’, we would have only the ones which have the character- 
istic subscripts 2, 3, , 9, 22, 23 , 29 , Disregarding the charac- 

teristic subscripts ‘2’, w'e w'ould ha\e the ones with the characteristics 
3, 4, , 9, 33, 34, , 39 , Fmall}-, if we should eliminate all indi- 

vidml characteristic subscripts, we would have a ‘general’ name A for 
the w hole group without singling out individual characteristics. 

All words of the type of ‘man’, ‘animal’, ‘house’, ‘chair’, ‘pencil’ , 
have been built by a similar process of abstraction, or disregard for 
individual differences. In each case of disregard of individual charac- 
teristics a iiczv neurological process was in\ olved 

Similarly, with ‘statements about a statement’. When we hear a 
statement, or see it in a W'ritten form, such a statement becomes a stimu- 
lus entering through the low'er centres, and a statement about it repre- 
sents, in general, a new process of abstraction, or an abstraction of 
higher order 

It becomes obvious that the introduction of a language of ‘different 
order of abstractions’, although it is not familiar, yet structurally it 
represents very closely, in terms of order, most fundamental neuro- 
logical processes going on in us As we already know, a natural order 
has been established by evolution , namely, lower order abstractions first, 
higher next, the identifications of orders or the reversal of orders ap- 
pears pathological for man and appears as a confusion of orders of 
abstractions, resulting in false evaluation identification, illusions, delu- 
sions, and hallucinations 

Historically, the first to pay serious attention to the above problems 
in a consistent, yet very limited, w-ay were mathematicians In the 
investigation of the problems of the foundation of mathematics, mathe- 
matical ‘logic’, and the theory of aggregates, w'e came across self-con- 
tradictions which would make mathematics impossible To avoid such 
a disaster, Russell invented w’hat is called the ‘theory of mathematical

t)pes'. The status of this theory is a very interesting and instructive 
one The theory soh es the mathematical difficulties, thus saving mathe- 
matics, but has no application to life Practically all mathematicians, if I 
am not mistaken, the author of the theory included, somehidv ‘dislike’ 
the theory and make efforts to solve the problems in a different way and 
possibly to abandon the theory altogether 

We have already shown that the introduction of a language of 
‘different orders of abstractions’ is structurally entirely justified and 
physiologically natural, as it describes, in terms of order, the activities 
of the nervous system Such facts are important, but if, in addition the 
introduction of a language of a new A structure would give us further 
demonstrable advantages, then the introduction of such a language would 
become increasingly desirable 

Although the majority of mathematicians ‘dislike’ the theory of 
tj,pes, yet, at present, this theory is unconditionally necessary for non- 
self-contradictory mathematics The author was pleasantly surprised to 
find that after his y?-system was formulated, this simple and natural, 
actional, functional, operational, non-el theory covers the theory of 
mathematical types and generalizes it, making the theory applicable not 
onjly to the solution of mathematical paradoxes but to the solution of the 
majority of purely human and scientific difficulties One general rule of 
‘non-coiifusion of orders of absti actions’, and the acquiring of the simple 
and workable ‘consciousness of abstracting’ based on the denial of the 
‘is’ of identity, offers a full structural and semantic solution The dis- 
regard of the issues involved leads fatalistically to the manufacture of 
endless and unnecessary human sufferings and unhappiness, the elimina- 
tion of which IS one of the mam points in a theoiy of sanitv There is 
no mystery in 1933 that continuous small painful shocks may lead to 
serious semantic and physical distui bailees Psycho-logicians and psychi- 
atrists will find it increasingly difficult to work at their problems if they 
disregard these semantic issues Parents and teachers uill find simple 
yet effective structural means for training the reactions of children in 
sanity, with all the ensuing semantic benefits to the individuals and to 
society 

When Whitehead and Russell were working at the foundations of 
mathematics, they came across endless paradoxes and self-contiadictions, 
which, of course, would make mathematics impossible After many 
efforts they found that all these paradoxes had one general source, in 
the rough, in the expressions which involve the word ‘all’, and the solu- 
tion was found by introducing ‘non-allness’, a semantic forerunner of 
non-identity Consider, for example, ‘a proposition about all proposi- 



430 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


tions’ They found that such totalities, or such 'all’ statements, were not 
legitimate, as they involved a self-contradiction to start with A 'propo- 
sition cannot be made legitimately about ‘all’ propositions without some 
restriction, since it would have to include the new proposition which is 
being made If we consider a m a term like ‘propositions’, which v rt can 
manufacture without known limits, and remember that any stat ;ment 
about propositions takes the form of a proposition, then obviousDy we 
cannot make statements about all propositions In such a case the state- 
ment must be limited , such a set has no total, and a statement aboult ‘all 
its members’ cannot be made legitimately Similarly, we cannot sjpeak 
about all numbers 

Statements such as ‘a proposition about all propositions’ have be“’" 

called by Russell ‘illegitimate totalities' In such cases, it is neces® 

*' ° istics 

to break up the set into smaller sets, each of which is capable of ha 

a totality This represents, m the mam, what the theory of types a 
to accomplish In the language of the Prtncipia Matheinatica, the pri 
ciple w'hich ct ables us to aioid the illegitimate totalities may be express', 
as follows ‘M hatever mvoh es all of a collection must not be one of t 
collection’, or, ‘if, provided a certain collection had a total, it would ha]^^ 
members only di finable in tenns of that total, then the said collectic 
has no total’ ^ The above principle is called the ‘vicious-circle principle^ 
because it allows us to evade the vicious circles which the introductioi_ 
of illegitimate totalities iniolve Russell calls the arguments which in- 
volve the vicious-circle principle, ‘\ icious-circle fallacies’ 

As an example, Russell gnes the two-valued law of ‘excluded 
third', formulated in the form that ‘all propositions are true or false’ 
We involve a Mcious-cncle fallacy if we argue that the law of excluded 
third takes the form of a iiroposition, and. therefore, may be evaluated 
as true or false Before wc 'an make any statement about ‘all proposi- 
tions’ legitimate, we mast limn it in some way so that a statement about 
this totality must fall oulside this totality 

Another example of a s icious-circle fallacy may be given as that of 
the imaginary sceptic who asserts that he knows nothing, but is refuted 
by the question — does he knozv that he knozvs nothing^ Before the state- 
ment of the sceptic becomes significant, he must limit, somehow, the 
number of facts concerning which he asserts his ignorance, which repre- 
sent an illegitimate totality When such a limitation is imposed, and he 
asserts that he is ignorant of an extensional series of propositions, of 
which the proposition about his ignorance is not a member, then sudf 
scepticism cannot be refuted in the above way

431 


We do not need to enter into further details concerning the elabo- 
rate and difficult theory of types In my A psvchophvsiological formula- 
tion, the theory becomes striictiiialK extremely simple and natural, and 
applies to mathematics at \\ ell as to a r crj large number of daily experi- 
ences, eliminating an nnbelievablj' laigc numbei of misunderstandings, 
VICIOUS circles, and other semantic sources of human disagreements and 
unhappiness 

It should be noticed that, in the given examples, we always made a 
statement about another stateiiieiil, and that the vicious circle arose 
from identif3ing or fiom the toiifiision of the orders of statements 
The way out is found in the consciousness of abstraiting, which leads to 
the semantic discriniinatinn between o> tiers of abstiaitions If we have 
certain propositions, pi, p2, P , . p», and make a new proposition about 

these propositions, say P. then, according to the present theory, the 
statement P about the statements pi, p2 , must be considered as an 
abstraction of higher order and so different, and must not be identified 
as to order with the propositions pi, p2, • pn 

The above psychophysiological foimulalion is entirely general, yet 
simple and natural in a ,,d-system To make this clearer, I shall take sev- 
eral statements concerning the theory of tjpes fiom the Pnncipm 
Mathemahca, shall designate them by (Pr ), shall icfoimiilate them in 
my language of oi ders of abstractions, and shall designate them as gen- 
eral semantics (G S ) 

Thus, ‘The vicious circles in question aiise from supposing that a 
collection of objects may contain mcmbeis nhich can uiih be defined

ments or objects or elements, or the like, and a statement about them 
belong to different ordeis of abstractions and should not be confused 
(G S ) In the language of Wittgenstein ‘No proposition can say any- 
thing about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in 
itself (that IS the ‘‘whole theory of types’’).’^ 



432 


VII. THE MECH-\XISiI OF TIME-BINDING 


In the language of the present general semantics a statement about 
a statement is not the ‘same’ statement, but represents, by structural and 
neurological necessity, a higher order of abstraction, and should not be 
confused ivith the original statement 

Similar reformulations apply to all cases given in the Pnnctpia 
Mathematical and so it becomes evident that the present theory covers 
a similar ground as the theory of types, and also covers an endless list 
of daily-life applications which are of crucial semantic importance in a 
theory of sanity We must stress here a simple, natural, and single 
semantic law of non-identity which covers all confusions of orders of 
abstraction This one rule and training teach us not to confuse the higher 
orders with the lower, not to identify words with objects (not to ob- 
jectif} ), as well as not to confuse higher abstractions of different orders 
Tins generality and structural simplicity constitute an argument m favor 
of the present y?-system. It is easier to teach a single, simple, and natural 
rule which covers a vast field of semantic sources of human difficulties 
For when the rule is explained, and the learner is trained with the 
Structural Differential, the semantic problem resolves itself simply into 
the showing with one’s finger different orders of abstractions, and insist- 
ing that ‘this IS not this’. 

If we consider the natural, structural, and empirical fact that our 
lives are lived in a world of non-identical abstractions of different 
orders, the discrimination between different orders becomes of para- 
mount semantic importance for evaluation Under such conditions we 
should become thoroughly acquainted with the mechanism of these dif- 
feient orders of abstractions We should notice, first, that the language 
of the Pniicipia Matheinatica is A, and involves the ‘is’ of identity. 
Such a language leads to identifications and to confusions, and makes 
simple issues difficult and perplexing The term ‘class’ is very confusing 
What do we mean by this term^ In life we have, and deal with, indi- 
viduals on objective, unspeakable levels If we take a number of indi- 
viduals, we have a number of them, yet they all remain individual If 
we produce an abstraction of higher order, so that the individuality of 
each member is lost, then we have an abstraction of a higher order 
(‘idea’ in the old language), but no more the absolute individuals of our 
collection The term ‘class’ in this respect is seriously confusing, as it 
tends to conceal a simple experimental fact, and leads to confusion of 
the orders of abstractions if the multiordinality of the term ‘class’ is not 
formulated 

Many critics and reviewers of the Prmcipia Matheinatica somehow 
feel this to be so, but their criticisms are not bold enough, and do not

go to the roots of the A semantic difficulty They do not pay attention 
to the A, ‘logical’, ‘philosophical’, and ‘psychological’ elementalistic 
method and language involving the ‘is’ of identity, in which the Intro- 
duction of the Principia is written Doctor Alonzo Church is the first, 
as far as my knowledge goes, to suggest that, following Peano, numbers 
should be defined in the language of abstractions He does not carry his 
analysis further, however, and does not state that it involves a language 
of entirely different A structure® If we abandon the term ‘class’ and 
accept the language of 'abstractions of different orders’, then we are led 
to the rejection of the ‘is’ of identity and to the present system, of which 
the theory of mathematical types becomes a necessary part The prob- 
lems of ‘class’ cease to be an ‘assumption’, as the different orders of 
abstractions are descriptions of experimental facts , and so the ‘axiom 
of reducibility’ becomes unnecessarv'. In my language, this axiom is 
also an aristotelian description of the experimental fact that we can 
abstract m different orders 

Section B Multiordinal terms 

In the examples given in Section A, we used words such as ‘propo- 
sition’, which were applied to all higher order abstractions We have al- 
ready seen that such terms may have different uses or meanings if 
applied to different orders of abstractions Thus originates what I call 
the multwrdmality of terms The words ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘true’, ‘false’, ‘func- 
tion’, ‘property’, ‘relation’, ‘number’, ‘difference’, ‘name’, ‘definition’, 
‘abstraction’, ‘proposition’, ‘fact’, ‘reality’, ‘structure’, ‘characteristic’, 
‘problem’, ‘to know’, ‘to think’, ‘to speak’, ‘to hate’, ‘to love’, ‘to doubt’, 
‘cause’, ‘effect’, ‘meaning’, ‘evaluation’, and an endless array of the most 
important terms we have, must be considered as multiordinal terms 
There is a most important semantic characteristic of these in o terms , 
namely, that they are ambiguous, or oo-valued, in general, and that each 
has a definite meaning, or one value, only and exclusively in a given 
context, when the order of abstraction can be definitely indicated 

These issues appear extremely simple and general, a part and parcel 
of the structure of ‘human knowledge’ and of our language We cannot 
avoid these semantic issues, and, therefore, the only way left is to face 
them explicitly The test for the multiordinahty of a term is simple Let 
us make any statement and see if a giien term applies to it (‘true’, 
‘false’, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘fact’, ‘reality’, ‘to think’, ‘to love’, ) If it does, let 
us deliberately make another statement about the former statement and 
test if the given term may be used again If so, it is a safe assertion 
that this term should be considered as m o Any one can test such a m o

term by himself without any difficulty The mam point about all such 
m 0 terms is that, tn general, they are ambiguous, and that all arguments 
about them, ‘in general’, lead only to identification of orders of abstrac- 
tions and semantic disturbances, and nowhere else Multiordinal terms 
have only definite meanings on a given level and in a given context 
Before we can argue about them, we must fix their orders, whereupon 
the issues become simple and lead to agreement As to ‘orders of ab- 
straction’, we have no possibility of ascertaining the ‘absolute’ order of 
an abstraction , besides, we never need it In human semantic difficulties, 
in science, as well as in private life, usually no more than three, perhaps 
even two, neighbouring levels require consideration When it comes to 
a serious discussion of some problem, errors, ambiguity, confusion, and 
disagreement follow from confusing or identifying the neighbouring 
levels In practice, it becomes extremely simple to settle these three (or 
two) levels and to keep them separated, provided we are conscious of 
abstracting, but not otherwise 

For a theory of sanity, these issues seem important and structurally 
essential In identifications, delusions, illusions, and hallucinations, we 
have found a confusion between the orders of abstractions or a false 
evaluation expressed as a reversal of the natural order 

One of the symptoms of this confusion manifests itself as ‘false 
beliefs’, which again imply comparison of statements about ‘facts’ and 
‘reality’, and involve such terms as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘true’, ‘false’, , As all these 
terms are multiordinal, and, therefore, ambiguous, ‘general’ ‘philosophi- 
cal’ rigmaroles should be avoided With the consciousness of abstracting, 
and, therefore, with a feel for this peculiar stratification of ‘human 
knowdedge’, all semantic problems involved can be settled simply 

The avoidance of m o terms is impossible and undesirable Sys- 
tematic ambiguity of the most important terms follows systematic 
analogy They appear as a direct result and condition of our powers 
of abstracting m different orders, and allow us to apply one chain of 
00-valued reasoning to an endless array of different one-valued facts, all 
of which are different and become manageable only through our ab- 
stracting powders 

For further details about the theory of types, the reader is referred 
to the literature on the subject and Supplement II*, here I shall give 
only a few examples of the complexities and difficulties inherent m lan- 
guage, and show how simply they become solved by the aid of A gen- 
eral semantics and the resulting ‘consciousness of abstracting’ 

As an example, I quote Russell’s analysis of the ‘simple’ statement 
‘I am lying’, as given m the Principia. ‘The oldest contradiction of the

kind in question is the Rpimemdes Epimenides the Cretan said that all 
Cretans were liars, and all other statements made by Cretans were cer- 
tainly lies Was this a lie^ The simplest form of this contradiction is 
afforded by the man who says “I am lying” , if he is lying, he is speaking 
the truth, and vice versa 

‘\\’hen a man says “I am lying”, we may interpret his statement 
as. “There is a proposition which I am affirming and which is false ” 
That IS to say, he is asserting the truth of some value of the function 
“I assert p, and p is false ” But we saw that the word “false” is ambigu- 
ous, and that, in order to make it unambiguous, we must specify the 
order of falsehood, or, what comes to the same thing, the order of the 
proposition to which falsehood is ascribed We saw also that, if /> is a 
proposition of the nth order, a proposition in which p occurs as an 
apparent variable is not of the nth order, but of a higher order Hence 
the kind of truth or falsehood which can belong to the statement “there 
IS a proposition p which I am affirming and which has falsehood of the 
nth order” is truth or falsehood of a higher order than the nth Hence 
the statement of Epimenides does not fall within its own scope, and 
therefore no contradiction emerges 

Tf we regard the statement “I am lying” as a compact way of 
simultaneously making all the following statements “I am asserting a 
false proposition of the first order,” “I am asserting a false proposition 
of the second order,” and so on, we find the following curious state of 
things As no proposition of the first order is being asseited, the state- 
ment “I am asserting a false proposition of the first order” is false 
This statement is of the second order, hence the statement “I am mak- 
ing a false statement of the second order” is true This is a statement 
of the third order, and is the only statement of the third order which is 
being made Hence the statement “I am making a false statement of the 
third order” is false Thus W'e see that the statement “I am making a 
false statement of order 2n -(- 1 ” is false, while the statement “I am 
making a false statement of order 2n” is true. But m this state of things 
there is no contradiction 

Clearly, if we should apply the language of orders of abstractions 
to the above case, a similar outcome is reached more generally and more 
simply. If we should confuse the orders of abstractions, we might 
naturally have an endless argument at hand This example shows how 
a confusion of orders of abstractions might lead to insoluble verbal 
problems, and how semantically important it is that we should not iden- 
tify, and that we should be conscious of abstracting, with the resulting 
instinctive feeling for this peculiar structural stratification of ‘human

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


knowledge’ We should notice that with the confusion of orders of 
abstractions, and by the use of m o terms, without realizing their 
a^-valued character, we may always construct an endless array of such 
verbal arguments to befog the issues, but that as soon as we assign a 
definite order to the m o terms, and so settle a specific single meaning m 
a given context for the many meanings any m o term may have, the dif- 
ficulties vanish 

As the above analysis applies to all m o terms, and these terms hap- 
pen to be most important in our lives, there is no use m trying to avoid 
these terms and the consequences of using them Quite the contrary, 
often It is structurally necessary to build a nt o term — for instance, 
‘abstracting’ — we must take for granted that it has many meanings, and 
indicate these meanings by assigning to the term the definite order of 
abstraction Thus, such a term as ‘abstracting’ or ‘characteristic’ , 
might be confusing and troublesome, but ‘abstracting in different 
orders’ , is not, as in a given context we may always assign the definite 
order and single meaning to the term 

It has been repeatedly said that a m o term has, by structural neces- 
sity, many meanings No matter how we define it, its definition is again 
based on other m o terms If we try to give a general ‘meaning’ to a 
m 0 term, i\hich it cannot have, further and deeper analysis would dis- 
close the multiordmahty of the terms by which it is defined, restoring 
once more its multiordmahty As there is no possibility of avoiding the 
above structural issue, it is more correct and also more expedient to 
recognize at once the fundamental multiordmahty of a term If we do 
so, we shall not get confused as to the meaning of such a term m a given 
context, because, in principle, m a context its meaning is single and fixed 
by that context 

The semantic benefits of such a recognition of niultiordinahty are, 
m the mam, sevenfold (1) we gam an enormous economy of ‘time’ and 
effort, as we stop ‘the hunting of the snark’, usually called ‘philosophy’, 
or for a one-valued general definition of a m o term, which would not 
be formulated m other m o terms , (2) we acquire great versatility m 
expression, as our most important vocabulary consists of in o terms, 
which can be extended indefinitely by assigning many different orders 
and, therefore, meanings, (3) we recognize that a definition of a mo 
term must, by necessity, represent not a proposition but a propositional 
function involving variables , (4) we do not need to bother much about 
formal definitions of a m o term outside of mathematics, but may use 
the term freely, realizing that its unique, m principle, meaning m a gnen 
context IS structurally indicated by the context, (5) under such struc-

tural conditions, the freedom of the writer or speaker becomes very 
much accentuated , his vocabularj' consists potentially of infinite numbers 
of words, and psycho-logical, semantic blockages are eliminated, (6) 
he knows that a reader who understands that oo-valued mechanism will 
never be confused as to the meaning intended, and (7) the nhole 
linguistic process becomes extremely flexible, yet it preserves its essen- 
tial extensional one-valued character, in a given case 

In a certain sense, such a use of m o terms is to be found in poetry, 
and it IS well known that many scientists, particularly the creative ones, 
like poetrj Moreover, poetry often conveys m a few sentences more of 
lasting values than a whole volume of scientific analysis The free use 
of m 0 terms without the bother of a structurally impossible formalism 
outside of mathematics accomplishes this, provided ive are couscwns of 
abstracting j otherwise only confusion results 

It should be understood that I have no intention of condemning 
formalism Formalism of the most rigorous character is an extremely 
important and valuable discipline (mathematics at present) , but for- 
malism, as such, in experimental science and life appears often as a 
handicap and not as a benefit, because, m empirical science and life, we 
are engaged in exploring and discovering the unknown structuie of the 
w'orld as a means for structural adjustment The formal elaboration of 
some language is only the consistent elaboration of its structure, w'hich 
must be accomplished independently if we are to have means to compare 
verbal with empirical structures From a A point of view', both issues 
are equally important in the search for structure 

Under such structural empirical conditions the ni o terms acquire 
great semantic importance, and perhaps, without them, language, mathe- 
matics, and science would be impossible As soon as we understand this, 
we are forced to realize the profound structural and semantic diflercnce 
between the A and A systems What m the old days w'ere considered 
propositions, become piopositional functions, and most of our doctrines 
become the doctrinal functions of Keyscr, or system-functions, allow mg 
multiple interpretations 

Terms belong to verbal levels and their meanings must be given by 
definitions, these definitions depending on undefined terms, w Inch consist 
always, as far as my knowledge goes, of m o terms Perhaps it is neces- 
sary for them to have this character, to be useful at all When these 
structural empirical conditions are taken into account, we must conclude 
that the postulational method which gives the structure of a given doc- 
trine lies at the foundation of all human linguistic performances, in 
daily life as well as in mathematics and science The study of these prob-

lems throws a most important light on all mysteries of language, and on 
the proper use of this most important human neurological and semantic 
function, without which sanity is impossible 

From a structural point of view, postulates or definitions or assump- 
tions must be considered as those relational or multi-dimensional order 
structural assumptions which establish, conjointly with the undefined 
terms, the structure of a given language Obviously, to find the struc- 
ture of a language we must work out the given language to a system of 
postulates and find the minimum of its (never unique) undefined terms 
This done, i\e should have the structure of such a system fully dis- 
closed, and, with the structure of the language thoroughly known, we 
should have a most valuable tool for investigating empirical structure by 
predicting verbally, and then verifying empirically 

To pacify the non-specialist, let me say at once that this work is 
very tedious and difficult, although a crying need, nevertheless, it may 
be accomplished by a single individual Because of the character of the 
problem, however, when this work is done, the semantic results have 
always proved thus far — ^and probably will continue so — quite simple 
and comprehensible to the common sense, even of a child 

One very important point should be noted Since language was first 
used by the human race, the structural and related semantic conditions 
disclosed by the present analysis have not been changed, as they are 
inherent in the structure of ‘human knowledge’ and language Histori- 
cally, we were always most interested in the immediacy of our daily 
lives We began with grunts symbolizing this immediacy, and we never 
realize, even now, that these historically first grunts were the most com- 
plex and difficult of them all Besides these grunts, we have also devel- 
oped others, which we call mathematics, dealing with, and elaborating, 
a language of numbers, or (as I define it semantically) a language of 
two symmetrical and tufimtely many asymmetrical unique, specific rela- 
tions for exploring the structure of the world, which is, at present, the 
most effective and the simplest language yet formed Only in 1933, after 
many hundreds of thousands of years, have the last mentioned grunts 
become sufficiently elaborate to give us a sidelight on structure We 
must revise the whole linguistic procedure and structure, and gam the 
means by which to disclose the structure of ‘human knowledge’ Such 
semantic means will provide for the proper handling of our neurological 
structure, which, in turn, is the foundation for the structurally proper 
use of the human nervous system, and will lead to human nervous adjust- 
ment, appropriate sr, and, therefore, to sanity

Human beings are quite accustomed to the fact that words have 
different meanings, and by making use of this fact have produced some 
rather detrimental speculations, but, to the best of my knowledge, the 
structural discovery of the multiordinality of terms and of the psycho- 
physiological importance of the treatment of orders of abstractions 
resulting from the rejection of the ‘is’ of identity — as formulated m the 
present system — is novel In this mechanism of multiordinality, we 
shall find an unusually important structural problem of human psycho- 
logies, responsible for a great many fundamental, desirable, undesirable, 
and even morbid, human characteristics The full mastery of this 
mechanism is only possible when it is formulated, and leads automati- 
cally to a possibility of a complete psychophysiological adjustment This 
adjustment often reverses the psycho-logical process prevailing at a 
given date, and this is the foundation, among others, of what we call 
‘culture’ and ‘sublimation’ in psychiatry 

Let me recall that one of the most fundamental functional differ- 
ences between animal and man consists m the fact that no matter in how 
many orders the animal may abstract, its abstractions stop on some level 
beyond which the animal cannot proceed Not so with man Structurally 
and potentially, man can abstract in indefinitely many orders, and no 
one can say legitimately that he has reached the ‘final’ order of abstrac- 
tions beyond which no one can go In the older day s, when this semantic 
mechanism was not made structurally obvious, the majority of us copied 
animals, and stopped abstracting on some level, as if this were the 
‘final’ level In our semantic training in language and the ‘is’ of identity 
given to us by our parents or teachers or in school, the multiordinality 
of terms was never suspected, and, although the human physiological 
mechanism was operating all the while, w e used it on the conscious level 
m the animalistic way, which means ceasing to abstract at some level 
Instead of being told of the mechanism, and of being trained consciously 
in the fluid and dynamic j r of passing to higher and higher abstractions 
as normal, for Smith, we preserved a sub-normal, animalistic semantic 
blockage, and ‘emotionally’ stopped abstracting on some le\ el 

Thus, for instance, if, as a result of life, we come to a psycho- 
logical state of hate or doubt, and stop at that level, then, as we know 
from experience, the lives of the given indmdual and of those close to 
him are not so happy But a hate or doubt of a higher order reverses 
or annuls the first order semantic effect Thus, hate of hate, or doubt 
of doubt — a second order effect — ^has reversed or annulled the first order 
effect, which w'as detrimental to all concerned because it remained a 
structurally-stopped or an animahstic first order effect

VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


The whole subject of our human capacity for higher abstracting 
without discernible limits appears extremely broad, novel, and unana- 
lysed It will take many years and volumes to work it out , so, of neces- 
sity, the examples given below will be only suggestive and will serve to 
illustrate roughly the enormous power of the A methods and structure, 
aiming to make them workable as an educational, powerful, semantic 
device. 

Let us take some terms which may be considered as of a positue 
character and represent the structure of ‘culture’, science, and what is 
known in psychiatry as ‘sublimation’ , such as curiosity, attention, 
analysis, reasoning, choice, consideration, know'ing, evaluation. The 
first order effects are well known, and we do not need to analyse them 
But if we transform them into second order effects, we then have 
curiosity of curiosity, attention of attention, analjsis of analysis, reasoning 
about reasoning (which represents science, psycho-logics, epistemology , ) , 
choice of choice (which represents freedom, lack of psycho-logical 
blockages, and shows, also, the semantic mechanism of eliminat- 
ing those blocks) , consideration of consideration gives an important 
cultural achievement, knowing of knowing involves abstracting and 
structure, becomes ‘consciousness’, at least in its limited aspect, taken as 
consciousness of abstracting, evaluation of evaluation becomes a theory 
of sanity, . 

Another group represents morbid semantic reactions Thus the 
first order worry, nervousness, fear, pity , may be quite legitimate and 
comparatively harmless But when these are of a higher order and iden- 
tified with the first order as in worry about worry, fear of fear , they 
become morbid Pity of pity is dangerously near to self-pity Second 
order effects, such as belief in belief, makes fanaticism To know that 
W'e know, to have conviction of conviction, ignorance of ignorance , 
show's the mechanism of dogmatism , while such effects as free will of 
free will, or cause of cause , often become delusions and illusions 

A third group is represented by such first order effects as inhibi- 
tion, hate, doubt, contempt, disgust, anger, and similar semantic states , 
the second order reverses and anmds the first order effects Thus an 
inhibition of an inhibition becomes a positue excitation or release (see 
Part VI) , hate of hate is close to ‘love’, doubt of doubt becomes scien- 
tific criticism and imparts the scientific tendency, the others obviously 
reverse or annul the first order undesirable s r 

In this connection the pernicious effect of identification becomes 
quite obvious In the first and third cases beneficial effects were pre- 
vented, because identification of orders of abstractions, as a semantic

state, produced a semantic blockage which did not allow us to pass to 
higher order abstractions . m the second case, it actually produced mor- 
bid manifestations 

The consciousness of abstracting, which invoh-es. among others, 
the full instinctive semantic realization of non-identit_\ and the stratihca- 
tion of human knowledge, and so the niultiordinalit\ of the most im- 
portant terms we use solves these weighty and complex problems 
because it gives us structural methods for semantic evaluation, for 
orientation, and for handling them By passing to higher orders these 
states which involve inhibition or negative excitation become reversed 
Some of them on higher lev els become culturallv important : and some 
of them become morbid Now consciousness of abstracting in all cases 
gives us the semantic freedom of all levels and so helps cvoluatton and 
selection, thus removing the possibility of remaining animalisticallv fixed 
or blocked on any one level Here we find the mechamstn of the ‘change 
of human nature’ and an assistance for persons m morbid stares to 
revise by themselves their own afflictions by the simide realization that 
the svmptoms are due to identifying levels which are essentialh tiitTerent, 
an unconscious jumping of a level or of otherwise confusing the orders 
of abstractions Even at present all psv chotherapy is unconsciously 
using this mechanism, although, as far as I know’, it has never before 
been structurally formulated in a general way. 

It should be added that the moment vve eliminate identification and 
acquire the consciousness of abstracting, as explained in the present 
system, vve have already acquired the permanent semantic feeling of this 
peculiar structural st]atifiiafion of hmiian knowledge which is found m 
the psycho-logics of the differential and integral calculus and mathe- 
matics, similar m structure to the world around us, without an_\ ditficult 
mathematical technique Psv cho-logically, both mathematics and the 
present system appear structiiralh similar, not onlv to themselves, but 
also to the world and our nerv'ous system, and at this point it departs 
v'ery widely from the older sv'stems 

Let me give another example of how the recognition of order of 
abstractions clears up semantic difficulties 

I recall vividly an argument I had with a young and verv gifted 
mathematician Our conversation was about the geometries of Euclid 
and Lobatchevski, and we were discussing the drop f mg and mtrodui tlon 
of assumptions I maintained that Lobatclievski mtroduced an assump- 
tion, he maintained that Lobatchevski dropped an assumption On the 
surface, it might have appeared that this is a problem of ‘fact’ and not 
of preference The famous fifth postulate of Euclid reads, ‘If a straiglit 



442 


MI. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


line falling nn two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same 
side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced 
indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than two 
right angles’ W'e should note, in passing, that a straight line is assitiiicd 
to be of ‘infinite’ length, which involves a definite type of structural 
metaphysics of ‘space’, common to the A and older systems This pos- 
tulate of Euclid can be expressed in one of its equivalent forms, as, for 
instance, ‘Through a point outside a straight line one, and only one, 
parallel to it can be draw n’. Lobatchevski and others deaded to build up 
a geometry iL-ithoiit this postulate, and in this they were successful 
Let us consider what Lobatchevski did. For this, we go to a deeper 
level — otherwise, to a higher order abstraction — where we discover that 
what on his level had been the dropping of an assumption becomes on 
our deeper level or higher order abstraction the introduction of an 
assumption, namelj, the assumption that through a point outside a 
straight line there passes more than one parallel line 

Now such a process is structurally inherent in all human knoidedge 
More than this, it is a unique characteristic of the structure of human 
knowledge We can alwa>s do this If we pass to higher orders of 
abstractions, situations seemingly ‘insoluble’, 'matters of fact’, quite 
often become problems of preference This problem is of extreme 
semantic importance, and of indefinitely extended consequences for all 
science, ps} chiatry, and education in particular 

The examples I have given show' a most astonishing semantic 
situation , namely, that one question can sometimes be answered ‘yes' or 
‘no’, ‘true’ or ‘false’, depending on the order of abstractions the answerer 
IS considering The above facts alter considerabh the former sup- 
posedly sharply defined fields of 'yes’ and ‘no’, true’ and ‘false’, and, 
in general, of all multiordmal terms ilany problems of ‘fact’ on one 
level of abstraction become problems of ‘preference’ on another, thereby 
helping to dimmish the semantic field of disagreement 

It is interesting to throw some light on the problem of ‘preference’ 
Which statement or attitude is preferable’ The one claiming that 
Lobatchevski dropped a postulate, or the one claiming that Lobatchevski 
introduced a new' postulate’ Both are ‘facts’, but on different levels, or of 
different orders The dropping appears as an historical fact , the intro- 
ducing as a psycho-logical fact inherent m the structure of human 
knowledge The preference is fairly indicated, the psycho-logical fact 
IS of the utmost generality (as all psycho-logical facts are) and, there- 
fore, more useful, since it applies to all human endeavours and not merely 
to what a certain mathematician did under certain circumstances

Section C Confusion of higher orders of abstractions 

We have already seen that Fido’s power of abstracting stops some- 
where If we are finalists of any kind, w’e also assume that our power 
of abstracting stops soniewdiere In some such way the finahstic, dog- 
matic and absolutistic semantic attitudes are built 

If, however, by the aid of the Structural Differential we tram the 
j r of our children in A non-identity and the inherent stratification of 
human knowledge and power of abstracting, we facilitate the passing to 
higher order abstractions and establish flexible sr ol full conditionality 
w'hich are unique for Smith and of great preventive and therapeutic 
value We thus build up ‘human mind’ for efficiency and sanity by 
eliminating the factors of semantic blockages, while, by engaging the 
activity of the higher nerve centres, we diminish the vicious overflow 
of nervous energy upon the lower nerve centres, which, if allowed, must, 
of necessity, make itself manifest in arrested or regressive symptoms 
The above issues are of serious semantic importance m our daily 
lives and in sanity All semantic disturbances involve evaluation, doc- 
trines, creeds, speculations , and vice versa Under circumstances such 
as described above, which appear inherent with us, it is dangerous not 
to have means to see one’s w'ay clear in the maze of verbal difficulties 
with all their dangerous and ever-present semantic components 

By disregarding the orders of abstractions, we can manufacture any 
kind of verbal difficulties , and, without the consciousness of abstracting, 
we all become nearly helpless and hopeless semantic victims of a primi- 
tive-made language and its underlying structural metaphysics Yet the 
way out IS simple, non-identity leads to ‘consciousness of abstracting’ 
and gives us a new working sense for values, new sr, to guide us in the 
verbal labynnth 

Outside of ‘objectification’, w'hich is defined as the evaluation of 
higher order abstractions as lower , namely, words, memories , as objects, 
experiences, feelings , the most usual identification of different higher 
order abstractions appears as the confusion of inferences and inferential 
terms with descriptions and descriptive terms 

Obviously, if we consider a description as of the nth order, then 
an inference from such a description (or others) should be considered 
as an abstraction of a higher order (n 1 ) Before we make a deci- 
sion, we usually make a more or less hasty survey of happenings, this 
survey establishing a foundation for our judgements, which become the 
basis of our action This statement is fairly general, as the components

of It can be found liy analysis practically everywhere. Our problem is to 
analyse the peiiei al case Let us follow up roughly' the process. 

We assume, fur instance, an hypothetical case of an ideal obsm-er 
who observes correctly and gives an impersonal, unbiased account of 
what he has observed Let us assume that the happenings he has obsers-ed 
appeared as : |t, , and then a new hapijenimg occurred. 

At this level of ob^ervalion, no speaking can be done. and. therefore. 
I use various fanciful symbols, and not words. The observer then 
gives a description of the above happenings, let us say a.h, c, i, . . . . .r 
then he makes an inference from these descriptions and reaches a cen- 
clusion or forms a judgement A about these facts We assume that facts 
unknown to him, which always exist, are not important in this case. 
Let us assume, also, that his conclusion seems correct and that the action 
A" which this conclusion motivates is appropriate Obviourly. we deal 
with at least three different let els of abstractions . the seen, experienced . 
lower order abstractions ( un-speakable ) , then the descriptive level, and. 
finally, the inferential levels 

Let us assume now another mdnidual, Smithi. ignorant of smic- 
ture or the orders of abstractions, of consciousness of abstracting, of 
j r , a politician or a preacher, let us say, a person who habitually iden- 
tifies, confuses his orders, uses inferential language for descriptions and 
rather makes a business out of it Let us assume that Simthi observes the 
‘same happenings’ He would witness the happenings 9,-^. Ji. - • •

formed opinion B, and so his description of the happening ^ is eoiouted 
by his older j r and no longer the x of the ideal observer hut B I xj = y 
His description of ‘facts’ would not appear as the a, b. c, d, . . . .r, of

to explain this by words alone On the Structural Differential it is show'n

Let us illustrate the foregoing with two clinical examples In one

both cases, the actions were undesirable In both cases, the parents 
unconsciously identified the levels, x was identified with B(x), and con- 
fused their orders of abstractions In the first case, they concluded that 
the boy was lazy, in the second, that the boy was a thief The parents, 
through semantic identification, read these inferences into every new 
‘description’ of forthcoming facts, so that the parents’ new ‘facts’ became 
more and more semantically distorted and coloured in evaluation, and 
their actions more and more detrimental to all concerned The general 
conditions in both families became continually worse, until the reading 
of inferences into descriptions by the ignorant parents produced a 
semantic background in the bojs of driving them to murderous intents 
A psychiatrist dealt with the problem as shown in the diagram of 
the ideal observer. The net result ivas that the one boy was not ‘lazy’, 
nor the other a ‘thief’, but that both were ill After medical attention, 
of which the first step was to clanfy the symbolic semantic situation, 
though not in such a general way as given here, all went smoothly. Two 
families w'ere saved from crime and wreck 

I may give another example out of a long list which it is unnecessary 
for our purpose to analyse, because as soon as the ‘consciousness of 
abstracting’ is acquired, the avoidance of these inherent semantic dif- 
ficulties becomes automatic In a common fallacy of 'Pehtio Pnncipu’,

or 'Begging the Question’ fallacy, we, by self-deceptive semantic evalu- 
ation, assume the conclusion to be proved In other words, we confuse 
the orders of abstractions Beside the wilful use of this fallacy by law- 
yers in courts to influence juries of low intelligence , a similar fallacy is 
widely committed in the reasonings of daily life and leads to many 
unnecessary semantic difficulties Particularly vicious is the use of the 
so-called ‘question-begging epithets’ We postulate the fact which we 
wish to prove, label it by another name, and then use the new higher 
order name in our premise It represents clearly a confusion of orders 
of abstractions 

All such terms as ‘un-patriotic’, ‘un-christian’, ‘un-amencan’, ‘pro- 
german’ (during the World War), ‘wet’, ‘dry’ , fall into this group It 
IS probably no secret that a large part of the population of this world 
was swayed by such methods during the w’ar. In times of peace, large 
countries are continually swai’ed by such use of terms which play upon 
the pathological jr of the population, thereby facilitating the ‘putting 
over’ of different propagandas Similar procedures lead to many seman- 
tic difficulties in daily life It is easy to see that the difficulty is general , 
namely, ‘the confusion of orders of abstractions’ The antidote is 
equally general, and is found in the elimination of the ‘is’ of identity, 
resulting in the ‘consciousness of abstracting’ It should be noticed that 
these pathological reactions have long been known, and that they are 
extremely general We are told about them m schools under the name 
of ‘logical fallacies’, disregarding their semantic character, and so it is 
practically impossible to eliminate them or to apply the wisdom we are 
taught It IS not difficult to see why this should occur In the older days, 
all the ‘wisdom’ was taught to us by purely ‘intellectual’, ‘verbal’, classi- 
cal A and cl methods We had no simple psychophyswlogical method of 
complete generalit} , which could be taught m a non-el w'ay affecting all 
nerve centres It is knowm how difficult it is to ‘change human nature’, 
which simply means that the older verbal educational methods could not 
properly affect the lower centres It seems that the first step m develop- 
ing a method to accomplish these ends is to use the Structural Differen- 
tial, without which it IS practically impossible to teach ‘silence on the 
objective level’ and ‘delayed action’ and to tram through all centres in 
non-identity, ‘stratification’, natural order, and so m appropriate sr It 
appears that now, to begin with, we have acquired a workable and 
simple psychophysiological method for changing identification into vis- 
ualization, and, in general, for the prevention or elimination of identi- 
fication or confusion of orders of abstractions We have now discovered 
a mechanism which involves and deals directly with the reactions of the

447 


lower centres, ‘senses’, affects, ‘emotions’ , . The older, difficult ‘change 
in human nature’ becomes an easily accomplished fact in a structural, A 
semantic education ‘Human nature’ can best be described, perhaps, as a 
complex of s r, which can be educated and ‘changed’ to a large extent 

It seems unnecessary to enlarge further upon this subject Every 
attentive reader can supply endless examples of this kind of semantic 
disturbances from his own observation or experience Naturally, the 
generality, simplicity, and physiological character of the method proposed 
in this work become powerful assets, and instruction m the A methods 
can easily be given to, or acquired by. e\erybody It can be taught in 
homes and schools It gives a preventive psychophysiological method of 
training the jr in the millions and millions of cases m which human life 
becomes wrecked through the lack of a zvorking structural educational 
theory concerned with these reactions But it is not enough to preach 
these ‘platitudes’, they must be practised as well If the parents and 
the boys mentioned above had been trained as children with the Struc- 
tural Differential, it would have been an impossibility for the situation to 
have become so acute 

Let us follow our daily experiences by the aid of the Structural 
Differential. We find ourselves on at least five levels The first repre- 
sents the un-speakable event, or the scientific object, or the unseen 
physico-chemical processes on the sub-microscopic levels w’liich constitute 
stimuli registered by our nervous system as objects The second con- 
sists of the external, objective, also un-speakable, levels on wdiich we 
see with our eyes. On this level, we could make a moving picture, 
including actions , (writing a book is also behaviour) The third level 
represents the equally un-speakable psycho-logical ‘pictures’ and s r On 
the fourth level of abstractions we describe verbally our facts, that 
humans (a) eat, sleep , (fc) cheat, murder , (c) moralize, philosophize, 
legislate ; (d) scientize, mathematize. Finally, in the present context, 
our inferences belong to the fifth level 

Unfortunately, we usually abstract facts (o), identify the levels, 
and form a conclusion ‘man is an animal’. From this conclusion we con- 
fuse the levels again and colour the description of the facts (b), (c), 
(d) , jump again to higher levels and build conclusions from descrip- 
tions (o) and from distorted, colouied descriptions (b), (c), (d), and 
so obtain the prevailing doctrines in all fields These again lead us, in 
the field of action, to the mess Ave all find ourselves in In this dervish 
dance between the levels we entirely disregarded uncoloured facts (d) 

The ideal observer would observe all forms of human behaviour at 
a given date, not leaving out facts (d) , then, without confusing his 



448 


YII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


levels, and also without confusing descriptions with inferences, he would 
reach his higher order of abstractions properly, with very different 
resultant doctrines, which would produce entirely different semantic 
evaluation, and motivate equally different action 

We may understand now why we must constantly revise our doc- 
trines, for the above analysis throws a considerable light on the fact that 
scientists need training with the Differential as much as other mortals 
(the author included) History shows that they have not officially 
checked themselves up sufficiently to become aware of this fatal habit 
of confusion of orders of abstractions through identification 

It might appear, at first glance, that all that has been said here is 
simple and easy On the contrary, it is not for the grown-ups , it is easy 
only for children and the young In all my studies and experimenting I 
have found that, for the reasons already given, the use of the Differen- 
tial appears essential, and that it requires a long while and training to 
accomplish new semantic results As a rule, unless they are very un- 
happy, people try to trust their ‘understanding’, and dislike to tram 
repeatedly with the Differential For some reason or other, they usually 
forget that they cannot acquire structural familiarity with, or reflex- 
reactions in, spelling, or typewriting, or driving a car , by verbal means 
alone Similar considerations apply in this case Without the actual 
training with the Differential, certainly the best results cannot be 
expected 

To gam the full benefit involves the uprooting of old habits, taboos, 
‘philosophies’, and private doctrines, the worst being the structure of 
our primitive A language with the ‘is’ of identity, all of which are deeply 
rooted and work unconsciously Only the semantic training with the 
Differential m non-identity can affect the ‘habitual’ and the ‘uncon- 
scious’ Rationalization, hp-service to the ‘understanding’ of it, will be 
of no use whatsoever Persistent training seems the only way to acquire 
this special structural sense for proper evaluation, and the habit of 
feeling when identification, or the confusion of orders of abstractions 
becomes particularly dangerous This feeling, as it involves most im- 
portant factors of evaluation, is difficult to acquire, as difficult, perhaps, 
as reflex-learning to spell or to typewrite But, when acquired, it makes 
us aware of the continuous, necessary utilization of many levels of 
abstractions, which becomes dangerous only when we identify them or 
are not conscious of this fact We can then utilize the different orders 
of abstractions consciously, without identification, and thus keep out of 
danger. Most of the important terms appear as multiordinal, and, al- 
though they belong to verbal levels, they apply often to all levels, an 



HIGHER ORDER ABSTRACTIONS 


449 


important structural fact impossible to avoid, and one which makes this 
special semantic sense uniquely necessary to acquire 

It seems unnecessary to repeat that everything that has been said 
above applies m the fullest extent to our ethical, social, political, eco- 
nomic, and international relations Before any sanity can be brought into 
the analysis of these relations, before they can be rationally analysed, 
the investigators would have to be trained to observe correctly and to 
avoid verbal structural pitfalls For the lack of such semantic training 
and re-education, the ‘time-honoured’ ‘Fido’ debates involving the ‘is’ of 
identity, continue on all sides, and lead to naught else but a waste of 
‘time’ and effort 

I say waste of ‘time’, simply because there seems no end to the 
paradoxes which, with a little ingenuity, we can build up when we begin 
to gamble with confusion of orders of abstractions and disregard multi- 
ordiiiality Any doctrine, no matter how structurally true or beneficial, 
can be defeated, confused, or dela 3 ’ed, by the use of such methods These 
problems appear of crucial semantic importance, because our lives are 
lived in a permanent structural interplay between different orders of 
abstractions All our achievements depend upon this interplay, yet the 
most acute and painful dangers also have their sources m the non- 
realization of this dervish dance between different orders of abstractions 

Since we cannot evade the passing from level to level, or the use of 
multiordinal terms, our wisdom should consist only in not abusing these 
semantic conditions of human life As we must do that, let us do it, 
but let us not identify the orders, and thus let us evade the dangers 
Consciousness of abstracting gives us the complete psychophysiological 
solution of this complex situation, as it allows us to have the psycho- 
logical benefits and to avoid the dangers by the use of physiological 
means 

In conclusion, I must stress once more the importance of the struc- 
ture of the language in which we analyse any given problem In the 
/i-system I am proposing, the terra order is accepted as one of its very 
foundations In 1933, we know that as words are not the things spoken 
about , structure, and structure alone, becomes the only possible content 
of knowledge, and the search for structure, the only possible aim of 
science If we trj^ to define structure, we can do so m terms of relations 
and multi-dimensional order The recent advances of science show, 
bejond doubt, that the day will come when all science will be formu- 
lated in terms of structure and, therefore, of physics, and physics 
formulated as a form of multi-dimensional geometry, based on multi- 
dimensional order, giving us, ultimately, multiordinal structure

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


The application of the term order, which involves physiological, as 
well as semantic, mechanisms of evaluation, to the analysis of human 
behaviour, has led me to the present ^-system and the investigation of 
the structure of language The discovery that some of the most im- 
portant terms we use appear multiordinal, a character concealed by the 
‘is’ of identity, has disclosed to us a most vital and inherent ps}cho- 
logical mechanism, responsible in humans for many most desirable, many 
undesirable, and many morbid human characteristics It disclosed, also, 
the psycho-logical structure of these characteristics, and so we have 
obtained physiological means by nhich to enhance the development of 
desirable characteristics, and to prevent or transform the others 

Further analysis lias disclosed a natural survival order in evaluation 
the event first, the object next, the object first, the label next, descrip- 
tion first, inferences next , in inherent importance We have also found 
that the majority of human difficulties, ‘mental’ ills included, involve 
semantic disturbances and exhibit, not the natural survival order, but 
the identification of different orders, resulting in a reversed (patho- 
logical) order 

It is impossible in this book to review the data of psychiatry from 
the A point of view, as this would require a separate large volume 
which, I hope, will be written some day, but any one can verify the 
statements made above by himself from clinical literature, and also by 
analysing his own or other persons’ life-difficiilties, quarrels, disagree- 
ments , which generally involve quite unnecessary sufferings Psjeho- 
therapeutic literature shows abundantly that the success of the physicians 
depends mostly on reversing the pathological reversed order in a given 
field, and so restoring the natural order in the sr It is easily verified 
that, in most cases, when ‘mental’ illness originated through different life 
experiences, these would have affected very little, if at all, a child or 
an adult who was conscious of abstracting, and whose nervous processes 
and corresponding semantic states followed the natural order 

With the aid of the Structural Differential and a A language of 
new structure, it is easy to tram the sr oi an infant, a child, or a young 
person, and possible, although much more difficult, to tram a grown-up 
m the natural order Such a training becomes a potent preventive struc- 
tural physiological method, as it eliminates the psycho-logical states of 
identification or reversed order, both of which represent the raw seman- 
tic material out of which future nervous disorders are produced 

The non-el term ‘order’ is equally applicable m life and science , 
gives us, in 1933, the simplest structural common base, and allows us to 



HIGHER ORDER ABSTRACTIONS 


451 


attempt the formulation of a science of man, which ultimately becomes 
a theory of sanity, a consequence of a non-anstotehan system 

It should be recalled that order is accepted in the present system as 
undefined and fundamental ; yet its use is easily explained by the aid of 
the term ‘between', and can be shown and applied in reference to em- 
pirical structures 

If we can formulate a method which, through the application of a 
psychophysiological term such as order, and a simple device such as the 
training of sr m the natural survival order, or reversing the pathologi- 
cal reversed order, includes the mechanism of non-identity and one of 
the most important human nervous functionings, such a method, because 
of its structural simplicity and physiological character, may be expected 
to prove very workable I desire to stress most emphatically the very 
important general, impersonal, preventive, semantic, reflex-character of 
such a method 

In actual life, we deal, for the most part, with persons who are 
‘mentally’ or nervously disturbed in different degrees We could, even- 
tually, divide them for our purpose into two groups (1) those who 
do not want to improve or get well, but wdio somehow like their ficti- 
tious worlds and the maladjustments connected with them, (2) those 
who genuinely w'ant to get over their difficulties 

In general, it is extremely difficult or impossible to achieve any- 
thing at all with the first group The second group is greatly helped 
if we give them means to w’ork by themsehes at their problems Very 
often It IS most effective to explain to them this simple ‘natural order’, 
‘identification’, and ‘reversed order’ mechanism, the inultiordmahty of 
terms , and so give them a definite psychophysiological symptom to 
struggle against These symptoms of identification or reversed order, in 
their generality and structural neurological fundamentahty, underlie the 
process of formation of practically all known semantic difficulties of 
evaluation 

The reader should not assume that it is ahvaj s possible to eliminate 
identification and so achieve this coveted natural order, or the reversal 
of the revel sed pathological order, but, wdieneier this is possible, the 
person is relieved in a great many psycho-logical fields The simplicity 
and generality, the physiological and slructural character of this method 
seems its main recommendation, particular!}^ as a preventu e measure or 
semantic training for sanity The training is a laborious process, requir- 
ing great persistence , but, to my knowledge, very few trainings are easy, 
and, perhaps, none leads to more important results than does this one.

order), which can be easily visualized It shniild be recalled that struc- 
ture, relations, and multi-dimensional order supply us with a language 
which completely bridges daily-hfe experiences with all science, leading 
toward a general theory of values Mathematics and mathematical 
physics then become the representatives and the foundation of all 
science, and m the human field a general theory of values will lead to 
adjustment or sanity and will some day include ethics, economics , 

For these reasons, the Structural Differential is uniquely useful, as, 
at a glance, it conveys to the eye structural differences between the world 
of the animal, the primitive man, and the infant, which, no matter how 
complex, IS extremely simple m comparison with the world of the 
‘civilized’ adult The first involves a one-valued orientation which, if ap- 
plied to the oo-valued facts of life, gives extremely inadequate, wasteful, 
and ultimately painful adjustment, where only the few strongest sur- 
vive The second involves oo-valued orientation, similar in structure to the 
actual, empirical, oo-valued facts of life, allowing a one-to-one adjust- 
ment in evaluation with the facts in each individual case, and producing 
’ a semantic flexibility , necessary for adjustment This flexibility is known 
to be the foundation for balanced semantic states, ‘higher intelligence’, 
Visualization requires a definite elimination, through differentiation, 
of harmful identification, which, as usual, is based on incorrect evalua- 
tion of structural issues Thus, we have had endless, bitter, and futile 
arguments as to whether or not the ‘mechanistic’ point of view' of the 
world and ourselves is legitimate, adequate , The average person, as 
well as the maj'ority of ‘philosophers’, identifies ‘mechanistic’ with ‘iiia- 
chmistic’ Roughly, mechanics is a name for a science which deals w'lth 
dynamic manifestations on all levels , thus, we have macroscopic classical 
mechanics, colloidal mechanics now being formulated, and the sub- 
microscopic quantum mechanics already being well-developed disciplines 
In the rough, ‘machine’ is a label applied to a man-made apparatus for 
the application or transformation of pow'er But even machines differ 
greatly , thus, a dynamo is entirely different m principle, m theory, and 
in applications from a lathe or an automobile 

If we ask ‘Is the i/iachmistic point of view of the world justified^’, 
the answer is simple and undeniable , namely, that this point of view is 
, grossly inadequate and should be entiiely abandoned But it is not so with 
the mechanistic point of mcw', understood m its modern sense and in- 
cluding the quantum mechanics point of view, which is entirely struc- 
, tural In 1933, we know positively that even the gross macroscopic 
' physico-chemical characteristics of everything we are dealing w'lth 
depend on the sub-microscopic structure (see Part X) The details are

VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


not yet fully known, but the pnnaplcs arc firmly established With a 
A understanding and evaluation of the unique importance of structure 
as the only possible content of ‘knowledge’, these ‘firmly established’ 
principles become ‘irreversibly established' We may go further and say 
that the quantum mechanics point of view becomes the first structurallj 
correct point of iieu and, as such, should be accepted fully in anj sane 
orientation If we stop identification, then we mil differentiate between 
some simple facts For instance, we mil understand that any semantic 
state, reaction, or process has its corresponding sub-microscopic, struc- 
tural, colloidal, and ultimately quantum mechanical processes going on 
m the ner\ ous s} stem ; however, the j r, or feelings of pain or pleasure , 
are not the sub-microscopic processes These belong to different levels, 
but with ac-valued semantics we can establish in principle a one-to-one 
correspondence between them Thus, when we differentiate adequately, 
the older mac/iimstic objections disappear entireh ; and, in its proper 
field, for structural reasons, we must preserve the mechanistic, and en- 
tirely abandon the too crude iiiac/iinistic attitudes The mechanistic 
(1933) attitude is based on structure and so is indispensable for visual- 
ization, and training in visualization automatically abolishes objectifica- 
tion, which represents an important special case of all identification 
From the point of view of a ^-system, adjustment and sanity in humans 
depend, to a large extent, on their ‘understanding’, which is entirely 
structural in character, therefore, we must accept a mechanistic (1933) 
attitude, which, in the meantime, can be visualized 

The finding of structural means of representation facilitate': viiual- 
ization, imagining, picturing. In the adjustment trend we start with 
lower nerve-impressions, ‘senses’, ‘feelings’ , lower abstractions, and 
these are abstracted again by the higher centres The higher centres 
produce the ‘very abstract’ theories, which cannot be visualized for a 
W'hile The lower centres, wdiich are involved m i isualization, can deal 
only with structures which can be ‘concretely pictured’ So we always 
tr> to invent mechanistic or geometrical theories, such as can be handled 
bj the low cr centres 

Individual ‘experiences’, supplied by the lower centres of different 
individuals, do not blend directly They are blended m the higher cen- 
tres In them manifold experiences, whether individual or accumulated 
by the race ( time-binding), are abstracted further, integrated, and sum- 
marized Once this has been accomplished, structural means are sought 
and discovered to translate these higher abstractions into low'er, the only 
ones w'lth which the lower centres can deal Then w’e can ‘visualize’ our 
theories, and the higher centres not only influence the low er centres, but 



IDENTIFICATION AND VISUALIZATION 


455 


' the lower centres have appropriate means by which to co-operate with 
the higher centres in their new non-el quests 

The lack of explicitly structural forms of representations is respon- 
sible, also, for the difficulties which arise when the higher order abstrac- 
tions are translated into the reflex-reactions of the lower centres, which 
^ can deal with ‘intuitions’, ‘orientations’, ‘visualization’. The so-called 
‘geniuses’ have a very subtle nervous system in which the translation of 

■ higher order abstractions into lower and vice versa is easily accomplished 
From the point of view of forms or representations, we can have two 
issues . ( 1 ) we may have el forms of representations which are not 
based on structure, visualization , and cannot efficiently affect the activi- 
jties of the lower centres, (2) we may have a non-el sjstem based on 

■ structure, visualization , which can be translated simply, easily, and 
efficiently into the terms of the lower centres These problems are of 
educational importance and should be worked out more fullj' 

In my experience with grown-ups who have had only a short con- 
tact with my work, I find, in many cases, that, although they may have 
even given their complete verbal approval of the mam point of the sys- 
tem, yet, invariably, in practice, the full application is lacking Obn- 
ously, the semantic importance of the present findings is not m the verbal 
approval alone, when that approval is not applied, but m the consistent 
and permanent instinctive acquisition of the new semantic attitude which 
involves a complete elimination of identification, allness, elementahsni , 

We can teach any one to repeat verbally, by heart, instructions for 
operating an automobile, a piano, or a typewriter, but no one could 
operate them satisfactorily by reflex-action after such verbal training 
alone To operate effectively and skilfully any structural complex, we 
must become intimately familiar with its structural working through actual 
reflex-training, and only then can we expect the best results In my ex- 
perience, this IS true with language, and, without the visual Structural 
Differential on which we can point our finger to the objective level and uige 
silence , such basic semantic reflex-trauung cannot properly be given 

If we ask a man ‘Do you know how to drive a cari”, and he an- 
sw'ers ‘Yes’, we assume that he has acquired the proper reflexes If he 
answers ‘No, but I know about it’, he means that he has not acquired 
the proper reflexes, but that his ‘knowledge’ is on purely verbal levels, 
non-effective in application on non-verbal reflex-levels This applies fully 
to Jr, we may ‘know’ about them, but we may never apply successfully 
what w^e supposedly ‘know’ To ‘know’ represents a multiordinal process 
which involves equally the activities of the lower nerve centres and of 
the higher. In our el systems we had no such distinction, and so we

confused them The older ‘knowledge’, when presented m el language, 
could not have been absorbed easil}’ by the non-el organisms-as-a-w hole 
As the main task, at present, is to unlearn the older j »■, the new reactions 
need a persistent training, particularly by the grown-ups The non-el, 
A language and method prove to have psychophysiological importance 
Although the neurological mechanism underlying identification, ob- 
jectification, visualization., is not well known (1933), neurology gi\es 
us evidence that in these states, as well as in delusions and hallucina- 
tions, the actual lower nene centres are somehow engaged We may 
assume that different ‘resistances’, ‘blockages’ , in some parts of the 
nervous system make the passage of nervous impulses more difficult, 
and It seems reasonable to suppose that, in such cases, the paths travelled 
b} the nervous currents are different 

In Fig 1, an hipothetical and over-simplified scheme of the different 
tjpes of distribution of nervous currents, as is known functionally, is 
suggested The ordering is not anatomical but functional in terms of 
degrees of intensity In this scheme, we may consider that the nervous 
impulse (A) reaches the lower nerve centres, the 
bram-stem and the thalamus, passes through the 
sub-cortical layers and the cortex, continuously 
being transformed Finally, in returning, it may 
take either the beneficial and adaptive semantic 
form of visualization (V), free from identifica- 
tion and semantic disturbances, or may in\olve 
identification, with semantic disturbances, such 
as objectifications of different orders (O). delu- 
sions (D), illusions (I), or, finally hallucinations 
(H) 

Identification, or confusion of orders of ab- 
stractions, consists of erroneous evaluation that 
which is going on inside of our skin has objective existence outside of 
our skins , the ascribing of external objectivity to words , the identifica- 
tion in value of ‘memories of experiences’ with experience , the identi- 
fication of our sr and states with words, the identification of infer- 
ences Avith descriptions , Identification is greatly facilitated, if not 
actually induced, by the A structure of language in which we have one 
name for at least four entirelj different entities Thus, the A ‘apple’ 
(without subscripts and date) is used as a label for the physico-chemical 
process , for an object, say, ‘apple, rtb23i933’ , for a ‘mental’ picture on the 
un-speakable semantic level, and for the verbal definition Under such 
linguistic conditions, it is practically impossible, without special trauiing,

not to identify the four entirely different abstractions into one , with all 
the following sinister consequences 

Delusions represent incorrect notions and inappropriate j r formed, 
not by insufficient knowledge or ‘logic’, but by affective pressure in a 
definite evaluational direction; as, for instance, delusions of grandeur; 
delusions of persecution , delusions of ‘sin’ , delusions of reference , 

Illusions appear more like real perceptions, but pathologically 
changed For instance, anything may be semantically coloured or inter- 
preted, or evaluated as an offense, or a threat, or a promise , . 

Hallucinations consist of ‘perceptions’, with all their vividness, but 
without any external stimuli Patients hear voices , see visions , feel 
pricks or burnings , when there is nothing to hear, or see, or to be 
pricked by 

In visualisation, identification does not occur, orders of abstractions 
are not confused, semantic disturbances do not appear, the evaluation 
IS correct, a ‘picture’ is evaluated as a picture and not as the events , . In 
other words, because of the consciousness of abstracting, the natural 
order of evaluation is preserved But once, through identification, this 
natural order is reversed, it marks a pathological condition more or less 
morbid, and often of a non-adaptive character 

Identification represents, in affective tension, the mildest semantic 
disturbance, consisting of an error in meanings and evaluation Objects 
are evaluated as events , 'ideas’, or higher order abstractions, are evalu- 
ated as objects, as experience, as the un-speakable semantic states or 
reactions , otherwise, as lower order abstractions The confusion m the 
field of higher order abstractions follows a similar rule Inferences 
obviously represent higher order abstractions than descriptions , so, when 
they are not differentiated, higher order abstractions arc again identified 
with the lower We all know from daily-hfe experience the fantastic 
amount of suffering we can, and do, actually produce for ourselves and 
others with such identifications. 

In delusions, a similar but more intense identification occurs, result- 
ing in erroneous semantic evaluation, wishes, feelings, and other 
semantic states inside of our skins are projected into the external world, 
gumg delusionally strong objective evaluation 

In illusions, we also ascribe to, or identify our complex semantic 
states with, different perceptions and evaluate our higher order abstrac- 
tions as lower 

In hallucinations, this process of reversing the natural order comes 
to a culminating point higher order abstractions are translated into, and 
have the full vividness and ‘reality’ of, lower order abstractions.

VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


We see that the pathological processes of ‘mental’ illnesses involve 
identification as a generalised symptom, vehich means the reversal, in 
different degrees, of the natural order of evaluation based on the inten- 
sified confusion of orders of abstractions The more intense this process 
of reversal becomes, the more non-adaptue and morbid the manifesta- 
tions It should be noticed that this analysis becomes a necessity once 
we decide to accept a non-el language This analysis is far from exhaus- 
tive, but an anal) sis in new non-el, structurally correct terms, throws a 
new light on old problems 

Hallucinations which result from ‘ph)sicar illness do not represent 
a permanent danger, but when a patient seems ‘physically’ well, and his 
confusions of orders of abstractions, delusions, illusions, and hallucina- 
tions become completely ‘rationalized’, then these are unmistakable signs 
of serious ‘mental’ illness, suggesting sub-microscopic colloidal lesions 
Now this ‘rationalization’ represents nothing else but a nervous disturb- 
ance and involves identification somewhere In ‘physical’ ills the nervous 
system may be disturbed, but the illness does not usually originate in 
nervous disturbances, and so, as such, is not dangerous 

The distinction between visualization and objectification based on a 
H-system seems new , the difference is subtle, but when it is formulated 
W'e can discover a simple means w’hereby to control the situation If w'e 
were to take a ‘bone’ made of papier-mache and smear it w'lth fat or 
meat, Fido w'ould, perhaps, objectify (identify) such a ‘bone’ from the 
smell and the form of the papier-mache w'lth an edible one, and would 
fight for it We do a similar sort of thing when we objectify Religious 
wars, the ‘holy inquisition’, the persecution of science, which w'e are 
witnessing e\en at the present day in some countries and communities, 
are excellent examples 

We should notice that Fido was able to trust his natural, even 
‘objectified’, instinct, for nature does not play such tricks on him, such 
as producing ‘bones’ of papier-mache If nature did, dogs that objectifi 
and persist in their liking for such ‘food’ wmuld soon be eliminated. 
These particular objectifications would be dangerous and painful to 
those particular kinds of dogs with that particular nervous system, and 
would ultimately prove of no sunival value Thus identification, which 
represents an inappropriate evaluation, is harmful to all life, but is little 
noticed at present, because the mam periods of the animal racial adjust- 
ment have been accomplished long ago Experiments on flies show that 
the number of mutants which may be produced in a laboratory is large, 
but very few would survive outside of a laboratory In unaided nature, 
these mutants probably occur, but seldom leave observable traces '

However, even today, as Pavlov has shown m his laboratories, we can 
impose, by an interplay of a four-dimensional order of stimuli, such con- 
ditions upon animals for which their nervous survival structure i\as not 
naturally adapted, and so induce nervous pathological states Wrong 
evaluation is, indeed, harmful to all life and accounts for such rigid 
survival laws m nature, which science teaches humans how to make more 
flexible Practically word for word, this applies to ourselves We are 
constantly producing more and more complex conditions of life, man- 
made, man-invented, and deceptive for the non-prepared These new 
conditions are usually due to the application of the work of some genius, 
and the nervous system and s r of most of us are not prepared for such 
eventualities. In spite of inventions and discoveries of science, which 
are human achievements, we still preserve ammahsUc systems and doc- 
trines which shape our sr Hence, life becomes more strained and in- 
creasingly more unhappy, thereby multiplying the number of nervous 
break-downs 

It is known that not all people are able to visualize equally well In 
the older days this fact was taken for granted, and did not suggest 
further analysis Under present conditions in many human beings and 
also m animals, as shown in the experiments of Pavlov, the visual 
stimuli are physiologically weaker than the auditory ones , in man, how- 
ever, the visual stimuli should be physiologically stronger than the audi- 
tory This difference does not affect the general mechanism of the cyclic 
nerve currents and orders of abstractions In the auditory type the mam 
returning currents are deviated into different paths The division be- 
tween ‘visual’ and ‘auditory’ types is not sharp In life we deal mainly 
with individuals who have no more than a special inclination for one 
or the other types of reaction 

In the case of ‘mental’ processes, human adjustment has to be 
managed on higher, more numerous, and more complex levels Obvi- 
ously, then, the auditory types are more enmeshed by words, further 
removed from life than the visual ones, and so cannot be equally well 
adjusted This fact should not be neglected, and on the human levels 
we should have educational methods to tram m visualization, which au- 
tomatically eliminates identification 

The auditory channels which connect us with the external world 
are much less subtle and effective than the visual ones The eye is not > 
merely a ‘sense-organ’ Embryology shows that the eje is a part of the 
brain itself, and what is called the ‘optic nerve’ must be considered not 
a nerve but as a genuine nervous tract This fact, of course, would 
assign to the eye a special semantic importance, not shared with other 



460 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


'sense-organs’ or receptors We ought not to be surprised to find that 
the visual types are better adjusted to this world than the auditor}' types 
In pathological states, such as identifications, delusions, illusions, and 
hallucinations, there seems to be involved a translation of auditory 
semantic stimuli into visual images In these pathological cases the order 
of e\aluation appears as label first and object next, while the adaptive 
order seems to require object first and label next. There seems little 
doubt that visualization is very useful, and that identification is espe- 
cially harmful The most effective means to transform the s r of iden- 
tification IS found III visualucation, which indicates its special semantic 
importance 

The semantic disturbance of identification may have many sources, 
auditory' included, hut the only' adaptive trend is in visualization, w hich 
involves in some way the optical neural structure Some structural light 
is thrown on this subject when w'e realize that, physiologically, the eye 
IS more closely related to the vegetative nervous sy'stem, w'hich regu- 
lates our vital organs, than the ear is In man the optic thalamus is 
greatly enlarged, so that the whole thalamus is often called the ‘optic 
thalamus’ Actually, the thalamus has many functions, other than visual, 
and IS connected w'lth affective manifestations 

As most of our observations are accomplished by the aid of the ey e, 
W'e should expect auditory types to be poor observers, and so racially, 
in the long run, not so w'ell adjusted semantically Observation shows 
that the auditory types often have infantile reactions — a serious handi- 
cap From an adaptne point of view the ‘normal’, non-mfantile, best- 
adjusted mdiiidual ought to be a wsual type Auditory ty'pes must 
also be further detached from actualities than the visual types, as audi- 
tory stimuli involve more inferences than descriptions, which is the 
opposite of the functioning of the visual types If inferences, rather 
than descriptions, are involved, vve naturally deal with higher abstrac- 
tions first, and with the lower next, and so there is always a danger of 
the semantic confusion of orders of abstractions, w'hich necessarily in- 
volves inappropriate evaluation, of which objectification is only a par- 
ticular case 

Ev'en to common sense it seems clear that there is a significant dif- 
ference between ‘knowing’ this world by hearing and ‘knowing’ it by 
seeing There is, likewise, a difference between the translation of higher 
abstractions into lower terms by the visual path, and the corresponding 
translation by the auditory path In daily life vve never say ‘I hear’ 
when vve wish to convey that w e understand , but vve say ‘I see’ When 
we say ‘I hear’, we usually wish to convey that we have heard some-

thing which we did not fully grasp or approve The above relation is 
rather important, but has not been sufficiently analysed The problems of 
introversion and extroversion are connected with it 

The relation between the problems of identification and the mnnber 
of values found in the empirical world in connection with the number 
of values ascribed, or assumed , by our semantic processes, is most 
important 

The following analysis is, by necessity, one-sided, over-simplified , 
as a fuller analysis would require a separate volume I consider many 
problems ‘in principle’ only , this allows me a briefer treatment necessary 
for my purpose, but it must be realized that our language and general 
semantics, which, in practice, we use unconsciously, are extremely com- 
plex and involve one-, two-, three-, and oo-valued components, never, as 
yet, sharply differentiated nor formulated Investigation shows that the 
Qo-valued semantics is the most general and includes the one-, two- , and 
few-valued semantics as particular cases The one-valued semantics of 
literal identifications are found only among animals, primitive people, 
infants, and the ‘mentally’ ill, although more or less serious traces of 
some identification are found in practically all of us, because these are 
embodied in the structure of our language and prevent the acquisition 
of the 03-valued systems necessary for sanity For my purpose, it is 
enough to formulate the problems for the complete elimination of primi- 
tive identification, and then modern, oo-valued, A semantics follow 
automatically Under such conditions, 1 must concentrate on the vital 
problem of one-valued identification and treat the two- , and few-valued 
systems sketchily, ‘in principle’, although we must realize that the last 
systems have been made more flexible by the use of many ingenious 
verbal devices which I do not even mention in the present work 

Let me repeat that the attitudes, flexibility, or fixity , of our j r de- 
pend to a large extent on the structure of language used, which involves 
also its appropriate general semantics The ‘logic’ of our schooldajs 
represents a composite affair, in the mam A, and we call it by this last 
name This ‘logic’ can be considered as a two-valued ‘logic’ because of 
the fundamental ‘law of the excluded third’, expressed as ‘A is B or not 
B’, by wffiich a third possibility is excluded But even the traditional 
‘logic’ had to admit in its scheme what was called ‘modality’ , namely, 
some degrees of certainty or uncertainty with w'hich a given statement 
is made Lately, Lukasiew'icz has shown that a three-valued ‘logic’ can 
be so formulated as to include modality Later, he and Tarski general- 
ized it to an «-valued ‘logic’ When n tends toward infinity, this ‘logic’ 
becomes the ‘logic’ of probability If these disciplines are made non-el.

we have what I call one-, two-, three- , and x-^alued general semantics 
Theoretically, and in practice, we are interested mostly in the one-, two-, 
three-, few-valued, and co-valued general semantics For my purpose, 
and for simplicity, I shall deal only with identification; that is, the 
primitive one-valued semantics, the influence of which is found in both 
the two- and three-valued semantics, and may only be completely elimi- 
nated m an co-valued semantics 

We live in a four-dimensional space-time manifold which, on all 
levels, consists of absolutely individual events, objects, situations, ab- 
stractions , and we must conclude that structurally we live m an indefi- 
nitely many-valued or oo-valued world, the possibilities of which follow 
in principle the laws of combinations of higher orders The above 
statement represents a description of a structural observation about the 
empirical world, independent of our pleasure, and can be contradicted 
only by exhibiting empirically, actual ‘identity’ or ‘absolute sameness’ , 
of different e\ents, objects, or situations , which exhibiting becomes an 
impossibility if we decide to investigate facts more fully 

Under such empirical conditions, for adjustment and so for sanit\, 
we must have on semantic levels such theories, systems, methods 
which would allow us in a given case, under given conditions, at a given 
date , to evaluate the individual happenings uniquely, or which w'ould 
allow us to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the essen- 
tially x-valued facts of experience and our semantic states It becomes 
obvious that this can be accomplished only if w'e ha\e x-valued and 
non-el general semantics We see that the tw'o-, or three-valued, el A 
‘logic’, ‘psjchology’ , and, in general, the A-system, being structurally 
different from the empirical w'orld, will prevent, in principle, such an 
adjustment and, therefore, sanity 

Identification may be considered as the remains of pre-human, or 
primitive, or infantile, one-valued semantics, which establishes, or results 
from, semantic states, by w hich the essentially »-valued facts of experi- 
ence are not differentiated or etaluated properly, and so the indefinitely 
many values of these facts are identified into a single value Such 
identification is always structurally unjustified and dangerous, and may 
be the result of a great many factors, such as low development, ignor- 
ance, insufficient observation, ‘wishful thinking’, fears, pathological 
states of our nervous system, different semantic disturbances, ‘mental’ 
ills, infantilism in the grown-ups , . But among humans we cannot avoid 
training, through the mechanism of language and its structure, in some, 
most often unconscious, general semantics, and so a great deal depends

on what kind of semantics or inelhods of evaluation wc impose on our 
children 

We should notice an important fact which is usually disregarded, 
namely, that a language, and often one word, involves a definite type of 
semantics. Thus, m primitive 'polysynthetic' languages, it is not a ques- 
tion of associations or superstitions, the mystic characteristics and the 
thing simply are not differentiated, but literally identified into one whole 
Thus, we have one-valued semantics where the ‘good’ and ‘evil spirits’ 
actually participate in everything considered as a synthetic whole ^ 

A language of ‘true’ and ‘false’ involves two-valued semantics , the 
introduction of adverbs or their equivalents introduces modality and so 
three-valued semantics The introduction of indefinitely many degrees 
between the ‘true’ and ‘false’ leads finally to oo-valued semantics

If we tram our children in one-, two-, three-, and more generally 
few-valued el, A reactions based on corresponding languages, ‘logics , 
the result must be that they will hate great difficultj- in adjusting them- 
selves to a world of non-el oo-valued facts, and that, even if they suc- 
ceed, this would ultimately happen onh after a great waste of efforts and 
unnecessary sufferings If we approach the x-valued facts of life with 
one-, two-, or e\en few-valued semantic attitudes, we must identify 
some of the indefinitely mant values into one or a few values, and so 
approach the x-valued world with an orientation which projects ignor- 
antl) or pathologically our restricted, few -valued semantic evaluations 
on the x-valued individual facts of experience. 

The abote explanations apply in the fullest extent to the structure 
of language The daih language, as well as our attitudes toward it. still 
reflects pnmitne structural jr of the period before it W'as known that 
on the objective lete's we deal cxclusncly with ■x-vahicd, four-dinicn- 
sional processes The language in the H-system represents, tii principle, 
what may be called a three-dimensional and one-, two- , more generally 
few'-valued linguistic sjstem structurally non-similar to the x-valued, 
four-dimensional et ent-process conditions Let us analyse, for instance, 
the A term ‘apple’ This term represents, in pi maple, a name for a ver- 
bal, one- valued, and constant intensional definition, in w'hich space-time 
relations do not enter '\\ hat are the structural facts of experience ^ The 
object which we call ‘apple represents a process which changes con- 
tinual!} ; besides, every single apple that ever existed, or will exist was 
an absolute inditidual, and different from any other objective ‘apple’ 
In applying such a three-dimensional and one-valued language to essen-

lially 00 -valued processes, we only make proper evaluation, and so ad- 
justment and sanity, very difficult 

Yet the structural adjustment is simple in a -system The A 
‘apple’ was a name for a verbal inteitsional definition; in a /4-system, 
we manufacture indefinitely many names for the indefinitely inanj objec- 
tive and different ‘apples’ by subscripts, ‘applci’, ‘apple 2 ’, ‘apples’ , sup- 
plementing the subscript with the date , thus, in ‘applet ,pcb 23 1933’, we gam 
the possibility of considering ‘apple„.t’ as oo-valued, and so, in a given 
case , we are enabled to have a single name which we could relate to 
single values of the objective, absolute individuals, and absolute individ- 
ual stages of the process Similarly with multiordinal terms Before the 
multiordmahty of terms was discovered and formulated by me m 1925, 
these terms were silently assumed in principle, to be one-valued, and we 
were either prevented from using them m connection with 00 -valued 
orders of abstractions, or, if used by semantic necessity, we identified the 
indefinitely many values into one Both results were undesirable , the 
first established semantic blockages to creative scientific work , the other 
promulgated semantic disturbances But once the multiordmahty of 
terms is established, we have 00 -valued terms to which, m a gnen con- 
text (by differentiating the different orders of abstractions which a con- 
text indicates), we can ascribe single values 

Such a pioneering analysis may appear difficult at first, but this is 
only due to the lack of familiarity and established pre-A and A 
one-, two-, three-, or few-valued sr, all of which involve ultimately 
identification somewhere Once identification is abolished, however, and 
this is childishly simple, although not easy and rather laborious for 
grown-ups, oo-valued semantics become natural and automatic, eiading 
very serious theoretical difficulties In the present volume, I had to 
elaborate in detail upon different issues, simply because my readeis will 
be mostly grown-ups with established pre-A, and A reactions, who must 
first be made to recognize the benefits of a. A evaluation before they will 
be willing to undergo a laborious re-education of their older s r The 
procedure in the training of infants and children is extremely simple 
and entirely on their levels 

There is, however, one point tliat I wish to make entirely clear 
From the older point of view, one might say that a /4-system maj'’ lead 
to ‘over-rationahzation’ and, consequently, take ‘all the joy out of life’ 
Such objections are entirely unjustified First of all, the /4-system leads 
to shallow, but often clever verbal interplay of definitions, mostly non- 
similar in structure to the world and ourselves, representing a species of 
apologetics, and usually called ‘rationalization’ The /4-system leads to 

30 



466 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


structural adjustment of language and sr, and a structwal enquiry, 
resulting in understanding It makes shallow infantile ‘rationalization’, 
‘wishful thinking’, and apologetics of different brands impossible, but 
leads to a higher order of adult intelligence, based on proper evaluation 
In mere ‘rationalization’, we often have clever, but shallow, infantile 
evaluation, based on the ignorance or disregard of structural facts, which 
alone make up the content of all ‘knowledge’ In a y^-system, by elimi- 
nating the sources of infantile evaluation and reactions, ive supply the 
nen ous system of the infant with uniquely appropriate material, so that 
It may develop into a ‘normal’ adult In the older system, instead of 
helping, we hindered the development of adult standards of evaluation, 
with u ell-known results There is nothing wrong with ‘human nature’ 
or the majority of nervous systems as such, but there is something 
definitely wrong with our educational methods inside and outside our 
schools. 

There is another point which is still more convincing and, perhaps, 
even more decisne. The above-mentioned older objections are due to rr 
based on the play upon elementalistic terms and are a neurological impos- 
sibility The organism works as-a-whole, and m the cyclic nerve currents 
it IS impossible, by any known educational methods, to abolish ‘emotions' 
But what can be accomplished is this By training m silence on the 
un-speakable objectne levels and in differentiation between different 
orders of abstractions, we automatically abolish the infantile identifica- 
tions and evaluations, we introduce a ‘delay in action’, which is the 
physiological means for getting our ‘emotions’ under control and for 
engaging the fuller co-operation of the cortex Infantile ‘over-emotion- 
ahsm’ IS abolished in the adult Infants wmuld behave as infants, but 
this infantile behaviour would not be carried into the period w'hen 
adulthood should begin The ‘emotions’ are not abolished but ‘sub- 
limated’ 

It IS true that many standards would be changed For instance, we 
might roughly say that an infantile type is often bored by a symphony 
and that jazz satisfies his infantile make-up If we were to take such an 
infantile growm-up and compel him to listen only to symphonies, this 
would not be kind, nor wmuld it transform his infantile sr into adult 
reactions But, if unhampered by inappropriate semantic and so neuro- 
logical training, he wmuld be free to develop normally into an adult, and 
his own preference would be toward a symphony rather than toward 
primitive throbbings, his enjoyment, then, would not be diminished, but. 
perhaps, made fuller.

Similar analysis could be made of all human interests, with the 
result that the forcing of adult standards on infantile types would 
remain unkind, but the sad part of it is that, in spite of repressions, 
impositions . , these imposed standards remain largely ineffective and are 
abandoned as soon as compulsion ends Not so, if, by proper semantic 
education, we allow the infant to develop normally into adulthood The 
new standards are not imposed, but become his own We do not then 
need compulsion from without, because the new standards act from 
within and become pleasurable and lasting 

A similar process is very obvious in the practice of psychotherapy 
The standards of evaluation of the patients are usually inappropriate 
to the conditions of modern life and often clash sharply with the 
accepted standards Moralizing without changing by other means his 
standards of evaluation never accomplishes any satisfactory therapeutic 
results , quite the contrary, it often does a great deal of harm A physi- 
cian would be very unwise to censure or condemn a symptom, as this 
would preclude any beneficial results What physicians usually do is to 
treat any symptom, no matter how repulsive, with great sympathy and 
understanding They do not attempt to change the symptom directly, 
but, by the understanding of its mam mechanism, they try to change the 
patient's standards of evaluation, of which the symptom is only a conse- 
quence. If at all successful and the physician succeeds in changing the 
inappropriate standards of evaluation, the symptom then automatically 
disappears In daily life, we usually attack only the symptoms, disre- 
garding mostly the underlying structural foundations, this method ac- 
counts for the doubtful results 

Under infantile standards we apply similar methods to society 
Many may w'ant to abolish wars, revolutions, ‘depressions’ , but they do 
not investigate structurally deep enough They attack the symptoms, 
instead of analysing the structural issues which produce these symptoms 

In conclusion, let us notice that the analysis of a semantic mechan- 
ism on a printed page requires new terms and the co-ordination of 
many details , which, at first, do not always appear so simple, although, 
once the theoretical side is mastered, the educational application is genu- 
inely simple Thus, the analysis of the one-, two-, three- , and oo-valued 
semantics may appear difficult, yet, m practice, it only amounts to im- 
parting through our educational systems a semantic flexibility, instead 
of fixity , to acquiring the inclination of starting with observations, fol- 
lowed by descriptions, from which we pass to inferences, in connection 
with awareness of these ordered processes , In training, it is enough to 
abolish identification, and this is easily achieved once we have produced 



468 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


the proper method, based on a language of new A structure. This last 
actually consists of but a feu , new, simple, and common-sense terms, the 
analysis of which helps us to discover a few simple and invariant psycho- 
physiological relations. Thus, identification is eliminated by starting with 
an ordinal language and method Once we get the feel of the horizontal 
and vertical stratification, and leam to diflFerentiate between orders of 
abstraaions, identification disappears. Silence on the objective levels 
produces a ‘delay’, ini olves and trains the cortex . our reactions become 
more and more intelligent in the human sense , , and the most impor- 
tant results are reached by the simplest means 

The training in \ isualization and the abolishing of objectification 
are the first and most important steps for a complete elimination of 
identification. \\'hen this first step is achieved, the rest is comparatively 
a ven' simple task 

But the reader may ask uhv we should have to use such unfamiliar 
and, therefore, seemingly difficult methods to achieve such obvious 
results. Do we really need a A-sy stem to achiev e the results vv’hich, even 
in an ,^4-system. are known to be desirable^ The answer is weighty 
with consequences and should be taken verv' earnestly In the ^-J-system, 
these desirable results could not be attained generally, because the struc- 
ture of our old languages and the method hampered rather than helped 
us New theories, new systems , are built precisely with the aim to 
facilitate adjustment Those questions which m the older days w’ere sup- 
posed to be ‘philosophical’, ‘metaphy sical' , the application of which re- 
quired a high grade of intelligence, knowdedge , to start with, become, 
m the new way, simply a problem of the structure of the language ti'c 
use All the issues appear closely interrelated. \Vt do not require ‘high 
intelligence’ nor ‘higher education’ to begpn with, in order to obtain these 
desirable results, as the results follow' automatically from the structure 
of the language we accept and teach our children Thus, the older im- 
possibilities are achieved simply and automatically, w'ith the greatest 
possible efficiency and the most lasting results.

ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


If the preliminary experiments described above should be fully upheld, 
an important fact in the physiology of the cortex will be disclosed — namely, 
that new connections can be established in the cortex, not only in the areas 
of optimal excitability, but also in those areas which are in one or another 
phase of inhibition (394) I p favlov 

That wretched monosyllable "all” has caused mathematicians more 
trouble than all the rest of the dictionary (23) e t bell 

these observations . . point to the view . that the mechanism 
of development of a conditioned reflex and the mechanism of external in- 
hibition are somehow similar, and that the process of external inhibition 
bears some relation to the development of new connections between dif- 
ferent cortical elements (394) i P. pavlov 

In particular the factor of duration of time was shown to act as a real 
physiological stimulus, and experiments were described in which definite 
time intervals appeared as effective stimuli (394) l. p pavlov 


The procedure for training m the present system by the aid of the 
Differential follows directly from the theoretical considerations which 
have been explained in the foregoing chapters The contentions of the 
system have been verified experimentally m all cases where it has been 
consistently applied 

The mam aim is to acquire the coveted ‘consciousness of abstract- 
ing’, on which non-delusional evaluation is based, and which becomes the 
foundation for non-pathological j r and sanity As we deal with different 
aspects of an organic process which inherently works as-a-whole, all 
these aspects appear strictly interrelated We have found by analysis 
two mam aspects which underlie the others It appears that the A 
structure leads to semantic states which can be formulated as the feeling 
of ‘allness’, and that, through the ‘is’ of identity, it leads to the con- 
fusion of orders of abstractions Thus, for training, the program is 
readily sketched we must first eliminate the ‘allness’, then we must 
impart this peculiar stratification of ‘human knowledge’ which follow's 
from the rejection of the ‘is’ of identity, in other words, eliminate 
identification It becomes also obvious that a theory of sanity cannot be 
separated from a ,^?-system 

Since the organism works as-a-whole, all nerve centres should be 
trained so as to impart a permanent, lasting, and ingrained feeling of 
abstracting Once this has been achieved, the recognition of the vertical 
and the horizontal stratification of human knowledge becomes, also, a 

469

VTI THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


permanent semantic state This gi\es us a kind of semantic co-ordinate 
system, m ■which we can represent any life situation or scientific situa- 
tion, or any difficulty, with great clarity, and so evaluate them properly 
In verbal theoretical explanations this procedure appears complex, in 
practice, it is not so It is extremely simple, provided we persistently 
follow the instructions, which are based on theory and practice Above 
all, w'e must not expect results too quickly. 

For reasons already explained, students should not only hear and see 
the explanations, but should also perform for themselves, should handle 
the labels and indicate v\ith their hands the different orders of abstrac- 
tions After preliminary explanations, the children should be called to 
the Differential, and, using their hands, they should explain it This 
applies, also, to grown-ups and to patients The Differential is not only 
a permanent structural and semantic reminder w'hich affects many nerve 
centres , it is more, for, in training, it conveys the natural order through 
all centres Any reader who refuses to use his hands in this connection 
handicaps himself seriously, because ordering abolishes identification 

Fundamentally, there is no structural difference between the use of 
language and the use of any other mechanical device, they all involve 
reflex-action It is well known that any pianist, telegraph operator, 
typist, or chauffeur would not be a successful performer if he had to 
meditate about every move he makes As a rule, verbal explanations of 
the working of the respective machines are necessary at first, yet the 
structural reflex-skill required is actually acquired by prolonged practice, 
where again all nervous centres are involved We all know what amaz- 
ing unconscious reflex-adjustments a good driver of a car can make in 
case of unexpected danger 

A similar semantic reflex-skill is required in handling our linguistic 
apparatus, and, in case of danger, of sudden turns and twists, our 
orientation should also work unconsciously That is why the structural 
feeling for the working of the apparatus is required All nerve centres 
should be trained to employ the most effective means to affect the organ- 
ism and Its working as-a-whole 

The semantic training of grown-ups and that of children do not 
differ in essentials Children have fewer established habits, have more 
fluid sr than adults, and, therefore, the results with children are 
achieved more quickly and last better 

I shall now explain how to tram children A similar method applies 
to adults, also; but an adult should not trust himself too much that 
he has completely acquired ‘consciousness of abstracting’ He must tram 
very thoroughly I speak from personal experience Although I have

the Differential before my eyes practically always and am the author 
of the present system, yet every once in a while I catch myself with one 
of the old vicious semantic habits Habits, and particularly linguistic 
habits, may be very pernicious and difficult to change. 

We do not need to 
start with profound theo- 
retical considerations, we 
may start with any famil- 
iar daily-life objects and a 
microscope or magnifying 
glass We bring the Dif- 
ferential into the class- 
room, with labels (except 
one) detached, but do not 
proceed to explain it We 
start with a little semantic 
experiment upon the sub- 
ject of ‘allness’ We take 
any actual object, an apple, 
a pencil, or anything else 
which IS familiar to the 
children The principles in- 
volved are entirely general 
and apply to all objective 
levels in a very similar 
way We tell them that we 
will have some fun Then 
we ask them to tell us 
‘everything’ or ‘all’ about 
the object in question, in 
this case, the apple \\ hen 
the children begin to tell 
us ‘air about it, we w^rite 
the characteristics down 
on the black-board This 
last ts vital W’e must have a visual and extensional record of the 
ascribed characteristics When the children have exhausted their ingen- 
uity in telling ‘all’ about the apple, we should not be satisfied We 
should make them doubt, urging them that, perhaps, they did not tell 
‘all’ about it, using the word ‘all’ continually The term ‘all’ should be 
stressed and repeated to the point of the children’s being thoroughly

annoyed with the term The more they learn to dislike this term, the 
better. We are already training a most important s.r. 

W~e should not be satisfied with the best answers made by the most 
intelligent children In a large class there may even be a child who tells 
us bluntly that it is impossible to teU 'all' about the apple e should 
concentrate on the less intelligent children and deal particular!}' with 
them There are many and important reasons for this For one thing, 
the children become more eager and more interested in their own 
achievement. Then, too, they easily learn by example what a difference 
m intelligence means This understanding of the shortcomings of others 
has an important semantic, broadening effect In life, numerous serious 
‘hurts’ occur precisel} because w'e do not appreciate some natural short- 
comings, and expect too much Expecting too much leads to ver} harm- 
ful semantic shocks, disappointments, suspicions, fears, hopelessness, 
helplessness, pessimism , 

The less bright children benefit also The experiment is conducted 
on their level, so that they also have the maximum chance to benefit 
Soon the children begin to argue about the new method and to explain it 
to each other by themselves , for we have touched very' vital and complex 
semantic processes of ‘curiosity’, ‘achievement’, ‘ambitions’ , character- 
istics strongly represented in the child’s life We erade, also, the danger 
of taking clever, yet shallow, replies as standard The last error would 
be fatal, as the issues are fundamental, and we should not rest content 
with mere verbal brilliancy 

When the subject seems exhausted, and the list of characteristics 
of the apple ‘complete’ (we repeatedly make certain that the children 
assume they ha\e told us ‘all’ about it), we cut the apple into pieces 
and show the children experimentally, using eventually a microscope or 
a magnifying glass, that they did not tell us ‘all’ about the apple 

It may appear to some educators that such training might involve 
some undesirable psycho-logical results But later, when consciousness 
of abstracting is acquired as a lasting semantic state, this fear appears 
entirely unjustified, as explained further on The first step in dealing 
with ‘reality’ seems to demand that we abandon entirely the older delu- 
sional methods 

When the children have become thoroughly convinced of the non- 
allness and the impossibility of ‘allness’, w'e are ready to explain to 
them what the word abstracting means, using again the terms ‘all’ and 
‘not air We show them a small rotating fan and explain to them about 
the separate blades which when rotating we see as a disk In such 
demonstrations we can go as far as desired All science supplies data 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


473 


(eg, the dynamic structure of seemingly solid materials) We must 
select the data according to the age of the children or the knowledge of 
the grown-ups Everything said should be demonstrated empirically 
from a structural point of view 

The next step is to demonstrate practically that an object taken 
from different points of view has different aspects for different ob- 
servers We may use different objects or wooden geometrical figures 
painted with different colours on different sides We may place the 
object in different positions and ask the children their descriptions, 
which should be written down The descriptions will, of course, be dif- 
ferent, and the children should be made thoroughly aware of this In all 
these preliminary exercises the ingenuity of the teacher has a vast field 
for exercise, and we do not need to enter into details. 

When all these results have been accomplished on the level of the 
least developed child, we then proceed to explain the Differential as a 
structural diagrammatic summary of the above results It is a positive 
condition that the new language be used, and that an object be described 
as an abstraction of some order. If this vital structural point is disre- 
garded, most of the psycho-logical semantic benefits of ‘non-allness’ are 
either lost or greatly lessened We should make this term clear to the 
child, and should train him in its use, as it appears uniquely in accord- 
ance with the structure and the functioning of his nervous system The 
child should be warned that the old languages are not structurally suit- 
able for their future understanding and semantic adjustment This 
warning should be repeated seriously and persistently 

Having eliminated ‘allness’, we begin to eliminate the ‘is’ of iden- 
tity, which, at the primitive and infantile stages of racial human develop- 
ment, happens to be extremely ingrained in our sr, embodied, as it is, 
in the structure of our daily language As was explained before, identi- 
fication IS a natural reaction of the animal, the primitive man, and the 
infant, reflected and systematized in the A and older linguistic systems, 
which, through the ignorance or neglect of parents and teachers, is not 
counteracted and so is continued into the lues of children and grown- 
ups, until, finally, it becomes embodied m the structure of what we call 
‘civilization’ (1933) In a theoiy of adjustment or sanity we must 
counteract this animalistic, primitive, or infantile jr by building a 
y4-system, w'hich entirely rejects the ‘is’ of identity 

In the /4-system, through the use of this ‘is’, different orders of ab- 
stractions were unconsciously identified in values, in obvious contradic- 
tion to empirical facts In other words, being identified in values, they 
were treated as of one order or on one level and so did not necessitate 



474 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


indefinitely many expanded orders of horizontal and vertical differences, 
Similarly with the objectively meaningless ‘infinite velocity’ of a process, 
it does not allow order But once we have a finite velocity of a process, 
order makes its appearance as an indispensable aspect of a process The 
finite and known velocity of nerve currents on the physico-inathe- 
matical levels results in ordered series on physiological levels, in non- 
identity and proper evaluation on semantic levels, and in orders of 
abstractions and a non-aristotelian system and general semantics on 
verbal levels 

Once we abolish m our language the always false to fact ‘is' of 
identity, w'e automatically stop identifying different orders of abstrac- 
tions We do not assume that they represent one level, which becomes 
expanded into a natural ordered series of indefinitely many different 
orders of abstractions, with different values Adjustment, therefore, 
sanity and adulthood of humanitj', depend on proper evaluation, impos- 
sible under conditions of delusional identification of fundamentally 
different orders of abstractions We must then tram the j r in the natural 
physiological order of the process of abstracting which, on the psycho- 
logical levels, become non-pathological semantic evaluation 

In the case of training in the ‘non-allness’, it was necessary to start 
with the analysis of an ordinary object, to give the child a simplified 
theoretical explanation, and then to demonstrate it empirically The 
child will be easily ‘convinced’, but this conviction is not enough, because 
It will not affect peimanently bis sr We explain this difficulty very 
simply, telling him that, although he ‘agreed’ with our presentation, he 
w'lll very soon ‘forget’ it, and so we need a permanent visual reminder 
which IS supplied by the strings, freely hanging from the event and 
from the object, and indicating those ‘characteristics left out’, or not 
abstracted 

In the elimination of the ‘is’ of identity, we have also structurally 
interconnected aspects The rejection of this ‘is’ becomes an equivalent 
to the stressing of the stratification in the structure of ‘human knowl- 
edge’ To facilitate training, we should stress both aspects by all avail- 
able means, and should involve as many nerve centres as we can Thus, 
through the ear we stress verbally the formula of the rejection of the 
‘is’ of identity by indicating with our finger the different orders of 
abstractions, in the meantime, affecting the eye while we repeat ‘this 
IS not this’ We utilize the kinesthetic centres, not only by pointing the 
finger to different levels, but also by making broad motions with our 
hands, indicating the stratifications We should train in both horizontal 
and vertical stratifications, always using the hands The horizontal 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


475 


stratification indicates the difference, or ordering of different order ab- 
stractions, the vertical stratification indicates the difference between 
‘man’ and ‘animal’ and the differences between the different absolute 
individuals. In both cases, the semantic effect of the ‘is’ of identity is 
countdfj^ted 

, The above procedure in training has an important neurological 
tbundation Besides what has been explained already, we find that a 
word has four principal characteristics with corresponding cortical lep- 
p resentations A word can be heard, seen, spoken, and written Lan- 
guage, thus, involves many nervous functions , e g , auditory, visual, and 
^diversified motor nerve centres, interconnected in a most complex net- 

I rk of ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ fibres The use of the Differential 
olves all available nervous channels, we see, we hear, we speak, we 
ve our hands, indicating stratification, ‘non-allness’ , engaging large 
tical areas, and so have the maximum probability of affecting, through 
i-el methods, the organism-as-a-whole. The Differential gives us a 
cial, simplified, yet advanced interracial structural symbolism (1933), 
ich affects wide nervous areas of the illiterate, or nearly illiterate per- 
, or of the infant , which otherwise could not be affected It is known 
t extensive reading and writing, as well as speaking a number of 
guages, has a very marked cultural effect and helps visualization and 
•sciousness of abstracting The leason can be found, perhaps, in the 
t that a learned polyglot, or a scholar, utilizes many nerve centres in 
ordination In the older days, unless one became a scholar of some 
sc rt, it was extremely difficult to train these nerve centres in co-ordina- 
ti m With the Differential we can train simply, and comparatively 
q uickly, all necessary nerve centres, and so impart to children and to 
practically illiterate persons the cultuial results of prolonged and dif- 
ficult university training uithout any complicated technique This last 
should always be regarded as a means and not as an end 

In my experience with children, and with men from the lowest 
‘mentality’ to the highest, the non-identity of different orders of ab- 
stractions IS usually taken lightly It all seems so simple and self-evident 
tnat no one assumes that there could be serious, unconscious, structural, 
semantic, linguistic, and neurological delusional mechanisms involved, 
which cannot be reached without specially devised non-identity training 
The delusional feelings of ‘allness’ and ‘identity’ are peculiar in that, like 
other pathological states, they tend to appear as all-pervadmg It is the 
most difficult in daily, as well as m medical, experience to make a 
breach in this all-pervading tendency, but once this delusional state is 
even partially replaced by glimpses of in o reality, the further elabora- 



476 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


tion and training in adjustment to ‘reality’ becomes comparative! 
simple Thus, in practice, if we start with ordinary objects, feelings 
and words, and train in the non-allness and non-identity, any c^ild, oil 
any grown-up, even an imbecile, can follow this easily Once feel- 
ing has been acquired, and in most cases it is only a matter <b^lfiethod 
and persistence to acquire it, tlie mam semantic blockage has been elimi- 
nated, and the rest is comparatively easy I have had no opportunity y^t 
to verify it, but I am convinced that even a superior imbecile could be 
trained to differentiate between descriptions and inferences, after he has 
learned to differentiate between the objective levels and words In such 
a training with imbeciles we can go m simplicity as far as desired , thus, 
if the given individual is hungry and says he wants ‘bread’, we hand him 
a label which is attached to the objective bread, and he would be quickly 
made to realize that the symbol ts not the thing symbolized ^ 

It should be realized that in the training we should impart the 
obvious fact that words or labels represent conveniences, and arc no 
the objects or feelings themselves We should carry the labels in tsv 
pockets, so to say, as we carry our money, or checks for hats or trunks 
and not identify them ‘emotionally’ with what they eventually stand for 
because monetary standards change, and hats and trunks get exchange 
lost or burnt To accomplish this, we must have objective labels, whit 
w'e may handle and carry in our pockets, and also an objective somethip] 
to which vve can attach the labels In the present /^-system the rejectio 
of the ‘is’ of identity is complete and applies to all levels Thus, tlj 
event is not the object, the object ts not the label, description is nk 
inference, a proper name is not a class name , the characteristSl 
ascribed to events, objects, or labels are not identical, an object, a sit» 
tion, or a feeling is not identical with another object, situation or fee 
ing , , all of which establishes a structure of horizontal and vert^i.' 
stratification At an early stage of the training, w'c must begin w^ I 
w'hat appears the simplest and most obvious to the child, namely, raf 
absence of identity between the wmrd and the object, or that the wor> 
IS not the object We accomplish this by stressing that one cannot sq’ 
on the zvord ‘chair’, that one cannot write with the word ‘pencil’, oi« 
drink the zooi-d ‘milk’. These simple facts should always be trans 
lalcd into the gcnei alized form, indicating with the hand the tw'O level 
on the Differential, conjointly with the fundamental formula ‘this is no 
this’. We should ahva>s tell the child that the formula is entirely ged 
eral, but for the present we should not go into any further details 

At this stage we can advance one step further, still using onl 
ordinary objects as examples, and explain the un-speakable characte,

ely, that whatever we can see, taste, smell, handle., 
^dividual (demonstrated empirically) and mi-speakable 
apple, bite it (actually performing), and explain that, 
^object IS not words , yet we are very much interested, and 
so, in this un-speakable level Then we explain repeatedly 
5gth, emphasizing the important principle of evaluation, that 
e must deal with the objective level, yet this lei el cannot be 
-by zt'oi ds alone As a rule, it takes a few weeks, or even months, 
Fe^hts simple j r is established, the old identification being psycho- 
icaUy very much ingrained Once this is established, we stress 
[?act yhat we must handle, look, and listen , never speak, but remain 
outwardly as well as inwardly, in order to find ourselves on the 
ive level Here we come to one of the most difficult steps m the 
Ifde ti'aining This 'silence on the objective level’ inv’olves checking 
'h neutral grounds of a great many ‘emotions’, ‘preconceived ideas’, 

^ I 

• ^tep, in the meantime, appears as the first, the simplest, most obvi- 
,most effective psychophysiological ‘reality-factor’ in eliminating 
” sional identifications 

fee the child is thoroughly aware of the absence of identity be- 
ords and objects, we may attempt the expanding of the notion 
jio the ‘objective levels’. Such training requires persistence, even 
t seems fundamentally simple VVe demonstrate and explain that 
ctual bodily performance, and all objective hapjjenings, are not 
At a later stage we explain that a toothache, or demonstrate that 
al pain of a prick , are not words, and belong to the objective 
kable levels. Still later, we enlarge this notion to cover all ordi- 
ajects, all actions, functions, performances, processes going on 
our skin, and also all immediate feelings, ‘emotions’, ‘moods’., 
n inside our skins which also are not words We enlarge the 
to all happenings on the objective levels and the animalistic, 
natuie’ begins to be ‘changed’ into quite a different hitman 


When this is accomplished the rest is much simplified, although 
much more subtle We explain, as simply as we can, the problems of 
evaluation and s r, stressing and making obvious the fact that our actual 
lives are lived entirely on objective, un-speakable lev^els We illustrate 
this all the tune by simple examples, such as our sleeping, or eating, any 
activities, or pain, or pleasure, or immediate feelings, ‘emotions’ , which 
arc not words If words arc not translated into the first order un-speak- 
able effects, with the result that we do not do something, or do not feel

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIM: 


something, or do not learn or remember something take 

no effect and become useless noises 

One fact should be stressed, namely, that the probMHjMpfe^one 
of ‘inadequacy of words’ We can always invent ‘adequat^H||||Bn^ut 
even the most ideal and structurally adequate language will^^^Hj^wg— 
things or feelings themselves On this point there is no 
promise Many people still utter quite happily, pessimistic ex];$a|K^| 
about the present language, based on silent assumptions connectet^^^H 
unconscious delusional identification, and believe that in an ‘ade^cHH 
language the word by some good primitive magic would be identical wi|H 
the thing The more the denial of the ‘is’ of identity is driven home, aaS 
the sooner it becomes a part of one’s s r, the sooner the ‘consciousness jBB 
abstracting’ is acquired 

We are now ready to go further into the theory of natural evalmK 
tion based on natural order As a preliminary step, we must show 
peatedly the difference between descriptions and inferences, using sim^H 
examples We must sti ess the fact that words, as such, must be divic^y 
into two categories a first, of descriptive, in the main, functio^E 
words , and a second, of inferential words, which involve assumptions ||R 
inferences Thus, ‘A does not get up in the morning’ may be corsider|B| 
as descriptive If A explicitly refuses to get up, the statement ‘A refusim 
to get up 111 the morning’ may also be considered as descriptive If A dj^ 
not explicitly refuse, this statement becomes inferential, because A ni;^E 
be dead or paralysed If ue would say simply, ‘A is lazy’, such a statB 
ment represents an illegitimate inference of high orders based on ignoW 
ance, because in 1933 it is known that ‘laziness’ represents a symptom ol 
ph) sico-chemical, colloidal, or semantic disturbances It should bS 
stressed that this discrimination between descriptive and iiiferentiaS 
words, although extremely important, is not based on any ‘absolute^ 
differences, but, to a large extent, depends on the context I shall riofl 
analyse this problem further, because any parent or teacher uho haM 
acquired the consciousness of abstracting himself will find more example^ 
at hand than are needed ^ 

We should notice here a very vital, yet generally diregarded, struc-',^ 
tural fact — that human life is lived under conditions which establish a 
natural order of impoitance between different ordcis of abstractions 
This natural order should be made the basis of natural adaptn e evalu i- 
tion and so sur\ n al j r As our lives are lived entirely on the un-speuk- 


able level, which includes not only scientific objects and ordinary objec‘s, 
but, also, actions, functions, processes, performances, feelings, ‘emo- 
tions’ , this level is obviously first in importance, and the verbal level. 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 479 

which IS only auxiliary, comes next in importance The analysis of the 
relatue evaluation between description and inferences appears extremely 
complex and would require a separate volume, beyond the scope of the 
present work Here we may assume the generally accepted opinion that 
the reliability of inferences depends on the reliability of the descriptive 
premises, and that description is more reliable than inference In im- 
portance and m temporal and neurological natural order, description 
comes first, inferences, next If we consider different orders of infer- 
ences, or inferential words, inferences or inferential words of lower 
order are more reliable and so more important than inferences of higher 
orders (inferences from inferences of lower orders) 

As science is a racial product and so represents structural descrip- 
tions and inferences of an enormous amount of constantly revised 
observations and formulations of past generations, this racial product, 
‘science’, is more reliable and important m principle, particularly in its 
negative results, than the individual abstractions of individuals If some 
individuals happen to be ‘geniuses’, who upset racial scientific abstrac- 
tions, they are under the scrutiny of other scientists who, no matter how 
biased or slow, remain judges of their products In 1933 the opinion 
of scientists is the most dependable opinion we have We must accept, 
at a given date, the racial, particularly negative, abstractions as more 
reliable, establishing in evaluation the event (scientific object) first, and 
the ordinary object next It should be stressed that the ‘object’ of daily 
experience, in human life, is by far not so reliable as that in the life of 
animals entirely without human interference Thus, a high tension wire, 
or a third rail, or high explosnes are not found m unaided nature and 
do not forewarn us as ordinary objects do These ‘objects' possess 
characteristics concealed or not obvious on the objectne level of our 
ordinary inspection of, let us say, sight, hearing, or smell, yet these 
characteristics appear just as ‘real’ and dangerous as eier It appears, 
then, that the ‘scientific object’, or the event, m contradistinction to the 
ordinary object, is more important than the daily object, no matter how 
important the latter might be In fact, the only macroscopic importance 
of objects, outside of aesthetic and symbolic values, may be found in 
those not obvious pfij^sico-chemical, microscopic, and sub-microscopic 
characteristics Thus the importance of food, or air, or a chair is found 
precisely in these physico-chemical effects wdiich result from eating, from 
breathing, and from resting on a chair, and so again these hidden char- 
■acteristics, revealed only by science, appear much more important than 
'the gross characteristics manufactured by our nervous systems which 
we recognize as an object 



480 VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 

We come thus to a natural scale of a definite natural orde>, which 
also establishes the natural order of genetic importance and represents 
the natural base for survival semantic evaluation For our purpose the 
relative order may be represented as the scientific object or the event 
first, ordinary object next, the ordinary object first, the label next, de- 
scription first, inferences next, extended to descriptive and inferential 
words 

If we use the ‘is’ of identity and identify in value or importance the 
different, ultimately non-identical, levels, we nullify in principle the 
natural order of evaluation, which, by psychophysiological necessity, 
appears as a reversal of natural order in various degrees We find many 
reasons for this curious fact, but, for our purpose, it will be enough to 
suggest that (1) words are simpler and take less effort to handle than 
objects, (2) inferences being higher order abstractions than descrip- 
tions, are psycho-logically closer to our feelings and easier for any indi- 
vidual to manage than impersonal descriptions which require developed 
linguistic training, power of observation, self-mastery , and, in general, 
consciousness of abstracting The reversal of the natural order must lead 
to non-adjustment and results in pathological symptoms in different 
degrees The natural order consists of asymmetrical relations expressed 
by an ordered series, not only as to space-time, but as to values All our 
experiences and all we know indicate definitely that ordinary materials 
('objects’) are extremely rare and very complex special cases of the 
beknottedness of the plenum , that the organic world and ‘life’ represent 
extremely rare and still more complex special cases of the material 
world , and, finally, so-called ‘intelligent life’ represents increasingly 
complex and still rarer special cases of ‘life’ When we identify the mem- 
bers of these series, we disregard the asymmetrical character of this 
series and transform it into a fictitious, or delusional, or false to facts 
symmetrical relation of identity. It becomes also obvious why in the 
.(4-system, which did not allow asymmetrical relations, proper evaluation, 
adjustment, and sanity in general were, in principle, impossible 

Although the language used in this connection is not familiar, it is 
not entirely arbitrary It appears experimentally that four-dimensional 
order has physiological importance on the one hand , on the other, that ^ 
on the psycho-logical levels it involves the semantic factors of evaluation 
In training in the physiological natural order, we train the evaluation or 
appropriate human and adult j r on the psycho-logical levels 

In the difference between the un-speakable ‘scientific object’ and 
the ordinary object, the objective le\el and the verbal level, we find the 
precise spot at which we differ most radically from the animals If we 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING

disregard these differences and retain the ‘is’ of identiti’, we must some- 
how copy animals in our nervous processes. Through wrong evaluation 
we are using the lower centres too much and cannot ‘think’ properly. 
We are ‘over-emotional’; we get easily confused, worried, terrorized, or 
discouraged , or else we become absolutists, dogmatists , . The results oE 
such copying of animals are usually tragic, as might be expected. Owing 
to wrong evaluation w'e add self-made semantic difficulties to the dif- 
ficulties which we actually find in nature When we live in a delusional 
world, W'e multiply our worries, fears, and discouragements, and our 
higher nerve centres, instead of protecting us from over-stimulation, 
actually multiply the semantic harmful stimuli indefinitely. Under such 
circumstances ‘sanity’ is impossible 

It seems that here in the elimination of the ‘is’ of identity we have 
put our hands on an extremely powerful reflex-mechaiiism for the edu- 
cation, or re-education, of our ‘emotional’ life As has already been said, 
suppressing or repressing our feelings is dangerous, and should be 
avoided The old animalistic educational systems were built on repres- 
sion and suppression, with sad results But since we had no other means 
of education, we had to use the older means or else abandon this 
special education altogether Not so in the new way with the Struc- 
tural Differential. We do not repress or suppress We teach silence on 
the objective level tn general, which is a most impressive 'cmolwnaV edu- 
cation, on perfectly neutral grounds, one of the consequences of the 
elimination of the ‘is’ of identity Any bursting into speech is not 
repressed, a gesture of the hand to the labels reminds us that words 
are not objects, or action, or happenings, or feelings Such a procedure 
has a most potent semantic effect It gives a semantic jar, yet this jar is 
not repression, but the realization of a most fundanieiilal, natural, struc- 
tural fact of esaluation in which we should all be well trained Dis- 
turbing sr subside, and no one is ‘hurt’ It takes long and persistent 
training, but the results are most beneficial. 

We must note an important difference between a statement involv- 
ing the ‘is’ of identity, that ‘we are animals’ — which has nothing to do 
with the actual facts, all of us (the animals, too) arc not words, but rep- 
resent absolute individuals and all different — ^and the statement that we 
'copj animals' in our nervous reactions In the first case, nothing can 
be done In the second case, although the results are equally sad, we 
can stop ‘copying animals’ the moment the mechanism is discovered and 
we begin to realize that we are doing so Thus, the old hopeless becomes 
hopeful

VII THE MECHAXISAI OF TIAIE-BINDING 


I have already mentioned that some educators may assume the 
eventual harmfulness of training in the consciousness of abstracting on 
the ground that children should be kept ‘close to reality’. The answer to 
such an argument can be found in the recognition that what in the older 
days seemed ‘reality’ must now, m the light of new knowledge, be con- 
sidered delusions, and the older training as preparatory for acquired 
un-sanity. The modern conditions of human life appear much more 
complex than those of animal life, or of the primitive man. Every year, 
perhaps even every month, new human ‘realities’ make their appear- 
ance, complexities arise and our educational systems do not equip the 
children semantically to meet these new conditions. After investigation 
one may find by himself that the older ‘allness’ and identifications repre- 
sent delusional factors found nowhere m the empirical world, and thus 
have to conclude that if we tram children in such delusions, adjustment 
to the actual world is made extremely difficult, if not impossible It is 
true that some beneficial results do not appear at once, but only after the 
full consciousness of abstracting is acquired Thus, at an early stage of 
the training, when the student begins to realize the delusional character 
introduced by the ‘is’ of identity, the general and well-known tendency 
may struggle hard to retain the delusions His first reaction may be that 
of disappointment, with its many concomitants, depending on his tem- 
perament, metaphysics , but when he acquires the freedom of Ae.'Ml 
consciousness of abstracting, all levels will be evaluated properly and 
he will be able to adjust himself to conditions of m o reality described 
in the present vvmrk, which cannot be avoided by any one ‘Knowledge 
or ‘intelligence’ is only possible with abstracting, and, therefore, it fun- 
damentally involves ‘non-allness’ ‘Omniscience’ would involve a ‘knowd- 
edge’ of every point-event These are fundamentally different, and such 
a world would be one of chaos, where knowledge would be impossible 
Life, m 0 abstracting, and m o intelligence start together and are con- 
ditioned by the m o process of abstracting 

Among the many semantically beneficial results of such training, 
besides the training in sanity and, therefore, in adjustment, a few other 
benefits should be mentioned. Our life, our m o mentation, the structure 
of our language, with its syllogisms, fallacies , consist for the most part , 
of the constant utilization of the different levels of abstractions This 
appears as an inherent cliaracteristic of ‘human knowledge’, and, there- 
fore, we cannot abolish it without abolishing m o intelligence altogether 
Intelligence requires the passing from level to level in both directions 
All the benefits we possess follow from this, but also many semantic 
dangers are hidden in it Similar remarks could be made about an auto- 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


483 


‘Low in- 
telligence’ 


‘High 

intelligence’ 



mobile, A great many beneficial results follow from the use of auto- 
mobiles , but there are also great dangers intolved For instance, at 
present we have regulations for the driving of an automobile A driver 
has to pass his examination, demonstrate his practical reflex-ability m 
driving , before he is allowed to drive in public Similarly with our 
language , w e find the greatest benefits in it, and we should utilize them 
Proper training in the use of language should teach us how' to avoid 
dangers Obviously, ‘consciousness of abstracting’ teaches us how to 
avoid these dangers , likewuse, once we become trained in the passing to 
higher and higher order of abstractions, we become capable of the per- 
formance of what we call ‘high intelligence’. The diflference between 
‘high intelligence’ and ‘low intelligence’ consists in the fact that a ‘high 
intelligence’ has a larger outlook backwards as well as forward , a ‘low 
intelligence’, as suggested m Fig 2, 
sees only a little backwards (ignor- 
ance) and foresees only a little A 
‘high intelligence’ has a larger span 
or field, it knows more about the 
past and looks further into the' 
future 

It is no mystery that w'hen we 
want to look further into the past 

and the future we need higher and higher order abstractions By training 
in this passing to higher and higher abstractions w^e tram the 'mind’ to 
be more efficient, this ‘mental’ expanding should be the structural and 
semantic aim of every education 

Once we eliminate identification, we must accept structure as the 
only possible content of ‘knowledge’ and also realize that no ‘knowledge’ 
IS ever free from some structural assumptions. Sometimes it is pathetic 
to watch the metaphysical perfoimances of some otherwise very eminent 
scientists, who seem entirely innocent of these facts They often attempt 
to divorce their metaphysics from science, and miss the point that primi- 
tive metaphysics represents ‘science’ or the structural assumptions of that 
period, whereas modern science represents structural assumptions or 
metaphysics of modern ‘times’, w'hich cannot be reconciled with the 
older ‘science’ The difference appears in dates, not m kind The real 
problem before mankind presents itself in the selection of a structural 
metaphysics. If we select the primitive structural assumptions and have 
to live under present conditions, we must become a split personality 
which cannot adjust itself If we accept modern structural assumptions 
called science, we may adjust ourselves In no case can we free ourselves 


Fig 2 



484 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


entirely from some structural assumptions The problem becomes one of 
dates, and of un-samty i ersus sanity These problems appear of unusual 
importance, because the difficult scientific technique does not enter into 
this field at all, and the few structural data (1933) can be given in the 
simplest form to children and even to the feeble-minded In the older 
days this problem was entirely misunderstood We tried to ‘popularize’ 
science m the sense that we translated structurally correct language into 
the daily language of primitive structure, this resulted only m bewilder- 
ment, we did not analyse the structure of language and its role m our 
lives and begin with a structural linguistic revision Once this revision 
is accomplished, and we build a A language, the semantic background is 
prepared for a natural acceptance of modern structural metaphysics 
(science) of each date and the older ‘popularization’ becomes unneces- 
sary Such procedure would help to integrate the individual, while the 
older methods only help to split him. 

Let us recall that the animal stops somewhere in his abstracting 
When we come to a stop, and consider it ‘final’ or that we ‘know all 
about it’, we copy animals in our nervous reactions Training in passing 
from order to order of abstractions as such, trains the particularly 
human, fluid, non-blocked sr, counteracts, and ultimately abolishes, the 
animalistic blockage In a language of a given structure we can express 
ourselves in a definite way ; and, if that way is incomplete, we must leave 
the field open, for in a structurally different language the issues may 
look entirely different 

It is fundamental to stress that the old ‘unknowable’ becomes en- 
tirely abolished This ‘unknowable’ originated m the primitive identi- 
fication and elementahsm Our ancestors could not miss indefinitely 
that identification was false to facts , yet somehow the emphasis, which 
the ecclesiastical authorities (for their purpose) laid on the im- 
portance of the A-systein, prevented them from completely rejecting the 
' ‘is’ of identity The un-speakable was called the ‘unknowable’, -a-veiy 
gloomy term, indeed The use of this term prevented them from dis- 
covering, long ago, that the only content of ‘knowledge’ appears as 
structural, with all the following non-el consequences ‘Knowledge’ was 
expected to represent somehow more than ‘knowledge’ — a silent self- 
contradiction On this foundation whole systems of delusions were built. 
With the newer realizations, we understand that the only possible con- 
tent of ‘knowledge’ appears as structural, so that we can know all which 
belongs to the structural legitimate field of ‘knowledge’ What does not 
belong to the field of ‘knowledge’ must be considered meaningless, and 
making noises about it, one way or another, will not help us at all , quite

of ‘philosophy' may realize, in this tasc, particiilarh , the drama and the 
dangers n hich the pla3’ing on such m o terms as ‘knowledge’ maj' need- 
lessly produce 

Through the semantic mechanism which it involves, ‘consciousness 
of abstracting’ abolishes iranj feais, despairs, and other disturbances 
which follow from the confusion of nrdcis of abstractions We become 
introverted extro\erts. in othei woids, we become alTectneh well-bal- 
anced, and read}- to deal with empiiical first order effects on their levels, 
and wnth verbal problems on their diflerent leicls \\'e leant, also, to 
ohscri’c, as soon as we have learned ‘silence’ on the ‘objectire levels’ 
Realizing that we abstract in dilTereni orders, we slowly .acquire the most 
creative structural fLchng that human knowledge is inexhaustible, we 
become more and more interested in knowledge , oui curiosity becomes 
aroused , our sporting spirit stimulated and our level of m o intelligence 
raised 

It IS well known that the higher intelligence is characterized bj a 
critical attitude By training with the Structural Differential until the 
memore of the charactenstics left out and the non-identit.v become a 
permanent semantic acquisition with us, this critical attitude is also devel- 
oped No one who feels habitually these ‘characteristics left out — ‘this 
IS not this’ — ^will ever take a nwd or a statement for gi anted He will 
enquire, investigate, will alwa_v3 ask 'what do >'ou mean’, a question 
which automatically leads to further investigation, and finall) strikes

a moron does not ‘think’ His nervous si stem w orks contlnualh^

productne or efficient Proper training and understanding of the seman- 
tic mechanism must add to efficiencj and productn eness Bj the elimi- 
nation of semantic blockings, as in identification, we release the creative 
capacities of any individual We release him from the primitive seman- 
tic bondage in the daily and constant use of a powerful instrument called 
language — full of benefits, but also full of dangers — the structure of 
which he totalh' misunderstands Such misunderstanding must lead to 
mefficiencj in the use, and so to the abuse, of this function Instead of 
being a semantic slave of the structure of language, he becomes its 
master 

When w e become more civilized and enlightened, no public speaker 
or writer will be allowed to operate publicly without demonstrating first 



486 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


that he knows the structure and semantic functioning of the linguistic 
capacities Even at present no professor, teacher, lawyer, physician, or 
chemist , is allowed to operate publicly without passing examination to 
show that he knows his subject The above statement does not mean 
control or censorship Far from it Our language involves a much 
more intricate, beneficial, or dangerous semantic mechanism than any 
automobile ever had or will have We do not control the drivers in their 
destinations They come and go as they please, but for public safety we 
demand that they should have acquired the necessary reflex-skill for 
driving, and so we eliminate unnecessary tragedies Similarly with lan- 
guage, of w Inch the ignorant or pathological use becomes a public danger 
of a very serious semantic character At present public writers or 
speakers can hide behind ignorance (1933) of the verbal, semantic, and 
neurological mechanism They may ‘mean well’, yet, by playing upon 
the pathological reactions of their own and those of the mob, they may 
‘put over’ some verj vicious propaganda and bring about very serious 
sufferings to all concerned But once they would have to pass an exami- 
nation to get their licence as public speakers or writers, they could not 
hide any longer behind ignorance If found to have vnsused the lin- 
guistic mechanism, such an abuse on their part would be clearly a mlful 
act, and ‘well meaning’ would cease to be an alibi. 

, We must accept the obvious facts which make the older theoretical 
‘democracy’ or the older theoretical ‘socialism’ a scientific impossibility 
If, in 1933, 99% of the population of the globe appear as infantile or 
‘mentally’ deficient, how can any one expect that the majority or the 
mass could ever have proper evaluation or non-pathological sr'> All his- 
tory show’s at present, and this evidence should not be taken lightly by 
scientifically enlightened society, that the majority appears ‘always 
w’rong’, and that all that we call ‘progress’, ‘civilization’, ‘science’ , has 
been achieved by a very small minority Such an understanding should 
guide our future conduct if we desire better results than we have at 
present Under A conditions, not the state, nor different private so- 
cieties, but professional scientific bodies would have to set the standards 
and perfect the technique of the linguistic structural examinations They 
. would also select members who would serve on the examination boards 
It might seem that such a A innovation w’ould-not be important or far- 
reaching This would be a mistake It seems that most of those public 
writers and speakers may be considered privately as ‘honest’ men, who 
do not realize that under A conditions they often impose on defenceless 
masses delusional states w Inch too often become of a pronounced morbid 
character Once such an examination would force them to look into 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


487 


structural, semantic, and linguistic problems, we may take for granted 
that a great many of them would become able to evaluate properly their 
own activities and comprehend the harm they do As a result, quite prob- 
ably, a great amount of useless, befogging issues, delusional writings 
and speeches would not be produced, with great benefit to all concerned 
No one would censure them Consciousness of abstracting would accom- 
plish that They would become their own censors, aided, also, by the 
newly developed consciousness of abstracting on the part of some mem- 
bers of the audiences or readers 

It would be desirable to experiment and introduce parallel classes 
in schools for a while, one group continuing m the old ^-system, the 
other being trained m the ^-system We may expect that at the end of 
a year the results would be fairly tangible The ones which acquire the 
'consciousness of abstracting’ should show a marked improvement in 
character, should behave better, and should also show better results in 
scholarship, not to mention, in addition, the preventive semantic benefits 
in their future life and adjustment Experimenting under various con- 
ditions IS very desirable, as we deal with such a tremendously broad and 
fundamental structural problem that it is impossible at present to foresee 
more than the main results and bearings 

In a school one three-dimensional Differential should be enough, but 
m each classroom a large printed diagram, which is published also, should 
be permanently exhibited on the walls and applied in all studies This is 
necessary, not only because such a reminder makes the children thor- 
oughly familiar with the ‘characteristics left out’, ‘natural order’ , but 
also because the children will discuss it and settle their educational and 
personal difficulties by its aid and so tram themselves in A reactions In 
my practice, I have found that one of the main difficulties of the learner, 
or m ‘thinking’, in general, consists m the fact that m any verbal discus- 
sion we must utilize different orders of abstractions and in o terms If 
\\ e do not realize this, the problem often seems \ ery involved , once we 
are conscious of it, however, the problem becomes simple In fact, it 
may be said that this special flexibility which is entirely absent in animals 
and little developed in the primitive man, represents the working mechan- 
ism of ‘high intelligence’, and that this special flexibility can be acquired 
through proper A training 

The dealing with reflex-reactions and with experimental theories in 
general has one very encouraging characteristic , namely, that no matter 
how difficult the theoretical side may be, the practical is invariably ex- 
tremely simple Thus, a theoretical treatise on the Einstein theory, or 
the new quantum mechanics, or on an automobile, radio, or piano, or 



488 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


on music, or the conditional reflexes of Pavlov , may present, and, in 
fact, generally does present, difficulties, because it is foimulaled on 
purely verbal and analytical levels But these levels are most important, 
for we find that on these levels the full evaluation, and so the full realiza- 
tion, of existing or possible relations and meanings is accomplished In 
these verbal levels we find also economical and effective means to analyse 
further developments on which the possible range of applications ulti- 
mately depends Such a treatise can be produced by a single man and 
thereby becomes available for the rest of us 

A description of the application is, however, very simple ; we label 
the related parts of some structure, describe, mostly in terms of order, 
their interrelations, and then give instructions how to act, push, pull, or 
turn a given part to get such and such results These descriptions, al- 
though verbal, refer exclusively to some physical structure, so that men 
of very low ‘mentality’ can soon become acquainted with the practical 
problems concerned When the reflex-handling of the physical structure 
IS acquired, the experimental and behaviouristic aspects become child- 
ishly simple A child can see the experimental results of any theory, or 
notice the ease and simplicity of the reflex-adjustments a good driver 
can make 

But what an infant, a savage, or an ignorant man cannot do, is 
appreciate the meanings of given occurrences and evaluate them , in other 
words, they cannot relate the given occurrences to other occurrences 
which alone give the significance of the happenings Thus, not only 
physicists, but even the average man, knew of the equality of gravi- 
tational and inertial mass, it took the genius of an Einstein, however, 
to evaluate properly, to have the proper semantic reaction toward 
this 'commonplace fact’. The present work shows clearly that all 
semantic disturbances exhibit a lack of proper evaluation, or in getting 
hold of the meanings, or relations, or order of different order abstrac- 
tions. Only a full theoretical understanding can supply us with those 
meanings and produce in us the proper jr of evaluation — a necessary 
psychophysiological step for further advance, and for full application of 
the conquests already made 

As the present work is experimental throughout, and deals with 
verifiable subjects, such as the structure of languages on record, the 
natural order of development, the pathological reversal of order, which, 
if again reversed, restores the natural order , and, when applied, brings 
about most beneficial experimental results, all that has been said about 
experimental theories applies fully in our case 



ON NON-ARISTOTELIAN TRAINING 


489 


Just as in other disciplines, the instructions are simple ‘push these’, 
‘pull this', or ‘turn that’ , so, in our case, this simple descriptive rule 
which refers to the objective Differential is given as ‘this ts not this’ 
Once the reflex-actuities have been acquired, we can, for instance, enj'oy 
the pleasure of an automobile trip, the music of a radio, or a semantic 
trip toward sanity in harmony with ourselves and others, very simply, 
m spite of the underlying theoretical complexities which are always 
means and not ends in themselves 

But here we must face an important difference It is easy to dem- 
onstrate empirically to the majority of us the usefulness or pleasurable- 
ness of automobiles and radios, but it is very difficult to demonstrate 
the benefits of consciousness of abstracting to those who have not ac- 
quired It Before the experimental data begin to accumulate and become 
common knowledge, the main evaluation will have to be made on theo- 
retical grounds Besides, before children can be trained by the simple 
and eas3’ methods outlined above, adults must first re-tram and re-shape 
their own s r, which re-training and re-shaping are not easy, and require 
even more difficult theoretical considerations Because of this, the present 
work had to be written in the foim of a text-book for parents, teachers, 
physicians, and workers in ‘mental’ hygiene, and for future students and 
research workers m psychophysiology and semantic hygiene 

At the beginning, in the application of the method, a number of dif- 
ficulties will be discovered which will have to be overcome As a rule, 
the training in non-pathological s r proves to be easiest and simplest with 
very young children Most of it, or at least the laying down of the 
semantic foundations for such reactions, should be accomplished at home 
by specially trained teachers, if the parents are unable to do that them- 
selves In countries or communities where the national or local govern- 
ments show an interest in the health of the population by providing, for 
instance, specialists in preventne vaccination, sjieciahsts to tram in pre- 
ventive measures against semantic disturbances will probably also be 
provided 

In elementary schools the teachers at first will have to train them- 
selves as best they can with the help of specialists , but in high schools, 
colleges, and universities, special instructors will have to be employed 

The first concern, then, is to start the education and training of 
teachers With this end in view, the present work has been written so 
as to form a fairly complete outline of the whole problem, reference 
literature has been indicated, so that any one who wants to specialize in 
the subj’ect can find some suitable text-book as a primer As to qualifica- 
tions for the professional A instructors, — it is, at present, very difficult

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


to foresee details, but, as the full consciousness of abstracting leads to 
sr which, also, follow unconsciously, or which should so follow, from 
the study and acquiring the feel of the calculus, — students of mathe- 
matics would, perhaps, be the most desirable Any specialist m a new 
line of work has to learn a great deal, and this cannot be avoided , but 
It makes a difference y, hat kind of training one has had as a young per- 
son Thus, it is simpler for a student of mathematics to learn about 
psychiatry, or psycho-logics, than for a psychiatrist or a psycho-logician 
to learn mathematics Howeier, for a person with university training, 
this IS less important than a genuine willingness to master the subject 
Once the consciousness of abstracting has been acquired by such a 
student, his semantic blockages will be eliminated. He will then have no 
difficulties whatsoever with details, or even m doing creative work 
along this line 

With very young children, in the beginning an hour a day for sev- 
eral months should be demoted to the subject. When they have acquired 
the consciousness of abstracting, the results should not be entirely trusted 
as to permanence, but, at least, once a week the problems should be 
recalled to them How many hours a w'eek should be devoted to it m 
high schools, colleges, and universities I shall not venture to suggest, 
because the working hours m these institutions are already very crow’ded 
The training m consciousness of abstracting automatically eliminates an 
enormous amount of semantic blockages, and would facilitate the acqui- 
sition of learning m all branches of knowledge, and so save ‘time’ and 
effort — ^the more so, if the respective teachers themselves were to become 
conscious of abstracting 

The beneficial results whicli are to be expected may be found m 
better scholarship, more interest m studies, improved character, higher 
m 0 intelligence, and a better generiil adjustment All of this seems quite 
apart from the preventive character of the training as a protection 
against many semantic disturbances in the future But when teachers of 
all subjects acquire consciousness of abstracting themselves, they will 
probably discover new means and methods of conveying more simply 
and more effectively what they wish to convey to their pupils. I am 
convinced that the hours spent on semantic training would actually turn 
out to be an important economy of efforts Moreover, it would effec- 
ti\ ely give the children and students the highest grade of cultural train- 
ing, which at present we acquire only occasionally and with difficulty, 
w'lthout the conscious co-operation of our teachers.

Section A General 

The name of Freud is usually assoaated with the term ‘the uncon- 
scious’ This term appears as a general descriptive term standing for a 
great many psycho-logical semantic processes In 1933 the work of 
Freud is generally accepted as important and very suggestive, although 
further experiments by many research workers and practicians have 
shown that the freudian formulations have not the exclusneness for- 
merly assumed for them 

It IS useless to deny that the term ‘unconscious’ is fundamental and 
necessary The use of the term is best shown in the study of hypnotic 
phenomena Some patients do certain things under hypnotic influence, 
and then seemingly lose all memory traces of such doings upon emerging 
from hypnosis Careful experiments showed that after prolonged efforts 
these recollections could be made accessible to the patients’ waking con- 
sciousness The difficulty in recalling was not ordinary ‘forgetting’. 
What IS ‘forgotten’ can also be spontaneously ‘recollected’ Here the 
situation seemed different, m that these lost ‘memories’ required con- 
siderable work and effort for their reconstruction. The psycho-logical

state m such cases of perfected ‘forgetting’ was called ‘unconscious’, 
which, as a descriptive term, is very satisfactory 

The origin of the freudian theory of the unconscious was strictly 
scientific The theory was a new generalization in a new structurally 
appropriate language to account for experimental facts Subsequently, a 
large number of other experimental facts showed that the work of 
Freud was sound as far as it went Different workers, from different 
sets of facts, amplified or reshaped the freudian theories At present, 
there arc several schools that differ widely in language, all of them based 
on the fundamental system-function of Freud, however 

In reading the literature of the subject, one finds most diversified 
material Seemingly, there are facts which prove ‘beyond doubt’ each 
and eiery theory, no matter how widely they differ among themselves 
It is also easy to find experimental facts which can be accounted for by 
seieral different theories 

Such a situation appears unsatisfactory This lack of generality 
conceals a very important and workable semantic mechanism, which, 
under A identification, ‘allness’, and elementahsm, becomes pathological, 
resulting in arrested or regressive sjmptoms Once we pass to a A-sys- 
tem free from the above harmful semantic factors of delusional evalua- 
tion, the difficulties do not arise The more my enquiry progressed, the 
more it became obvious that the underlying mechanism appears similar 
in all psychoanalytical theories It seems that the general problem may 
be formulated as the need to dlsco^er methods for non-delusional evalua- 
tion affecting our s r, and so be able to make the ‘unconscious’ ‘conscious’ 

The term ‘consciousness’ is an incomplete symbol, as it lacks con- 
tent If we use the term ‘consciousness of abstracting’, we ascribe 
content and also gam empirical means to bring under educational control 
a vast array of important psycho-logical jirocesses The negative term 
‘unconscious’ does not imply specific content, and the mam difficulty in 
its practical application is to find its content, or to ascribe content to it 
Once this is achieved, the ‘unconscious’ becomes ‘conscious’ A patient 
w'hose unconscious semantic difficulty is made conscious either improves 
or IS entirely relieved For a general theory, we must find general struc- 
tural means of ascribing semantic content to the ‘unconscious’ Diffei ent 
schools have elaborated different means of discovering this desired content 
All schools agree that the behaviour difficulties are due to experiences 
hidden m the ‘unconscious’ and that bringing them to ‘consciousness’ 
seems the mam goal The diverse schools have an unduly bitter atti- 
tude toward one another, and have not attempted to analyse the prob- 
lems at hand from a more general, more workable non-el structural.

semantic, system-function, and linguistic point of view Whether or 
not the term ‘consciousness’ has any content besides ‘consciousness of 
abstracting’ may be disregarded for the moment At any rate, the term 
‘consciousness of abstracting’ gives very vital and workable psycho- 
physiological means of analysis, of an impersonal, and general structural, 
and semantic character Enquiry into the clinical cases and literature 
shows that pathological cases, amenable to treatment, appear improved 
by a similar evaluational treatment, namely, the correction in some form 
or another of the semantic disturbance of the lack of ‘consciousness of 
abstracting’ 

‘Mental’ illnesses (infantilism included) appear as semantic arrested 
development or a regression to lower levels, to those of the primitive 
man, the infant, the animal The animal is )>ot conscious of abstracting , 
man can become so. Here we find the precise mechanism of a decisive 
nature which not only supplies us with preventive measures, but which 
should also become of therapeutic value 

All life exhibits conservative characteristics acquired during the 
long periods of its development In the facts of heredity and embry- 
ology, we have an excellent evidence of this In its development, the 
germ cell of an animal or man repeats in a very abbreviated way the 
structures of forms from which it descended The ever-changing envir- 
onmental conditions, although they affect each organism to a large extent, 
produce extremely few hereditary changes, wdiich again may be con- 
sidered an indication of the conservative characteristics of life 

As we have already explained, life, abstracting, and ‘intelligence’ 
started together, and are consequences of the physico-chemical colloidal 
structure of the protoplasm Psychiatry also assumes that ‘the uncon- 
scious’, ‘tendencies’, and ‘impulses’ originated ivith life itself From this 
point of view the past piled up structurally upon the past until the highly 
complex organism called Smith made its appearance In this process 
of evolution the ‘instincts’ and ‘impulses’ have had an important role, not 
only conservative, but also compensatory and protective In man, j r 
should be based on proper evaluation and so play both a stimulating and 
protective role Under A conditions of delusional evaluation, the pro- 
tective role appears practically non-existent , the human organism, under 
modern conditions, becomes over-stimulated, resulting often in patho- 
logical conditions Consciousness of abstracting, or the elimination of 
delusional evaluation, abolishes man-made, artificial, and harmful 
irritants. 

I shall borrow from Jelhffe an excellent diagram to illustrate the 
evolution of the periods of growth and shall follow closely his exposition.^

Some such classification of the periods of growth has been forced upon 
ps)’chiatrists by the study of ‘mental’ ills, and is justified by embryology 
and an endless chain of empirical observations 

The first period represents the archaic period and is of the greatest 
antiquity In it the past is roughly recapitulated from, let us say, the 
beginning of unicellular life to the anthropoid ape At the fertilization of 
the egg the hereditary constitution is established, and during the gesta- 
tion period all prenatal influences are laid down The life of the baby 
before birth may be described as a vegetative existence of full indolence 
with all needs supplied by the mother’s body 

At birth, the first ‘struggle for existence’ begins, the struggle for 
air, as symbolized by the first cry At this epoch the baby already appears 
as a self-running organism with some ^ r His vegetative nervous system 
IS integrated and functioning He begins to ‘feel’ Pleasure and pain 
begin to be significant semantic factors This period is called the organ 
erotic or autoerotic, since, as with animals, its mam interests are 'sense' 
gratifications Many millions of ‘sense’ receptors suddenly have thrust 
upon them from the environment a mass of energy with which the 
organism has to deal somehow At first there is a rivalry between differ- 
ent ‘senses’ Later, co-ordination appears Each group of receptors 
establishes its own semantic values for itself, depending upon its own 
cell growth This period may be divided, schematically, from birth to 
seven years, and corresponds roughly to the evolution from the higher 
animals to primitive man This period is extremely important from a 
semantic and educational point of view At this stage in the human 
child the nervous system is not fully developed, and different environ- 
mental influences (language, doctrines included) may twist this develop- 
ment, so that irreparable harm can easily be done 

The narcissistic period is named after the Greek mythical figure. 
Narcissus, who, seeing his reflection m a pool of water, became so en- 
grossed in self -adoration that he rejected the attentions of Venus and 
was killed In another version of the myth his punishment was loss of 
sight This period covers, more or less, from seven years to fourteen 
years As the name indicates, it represents a semantic period of self-love 




UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


495 


The child has not entered, as yet, into a social stage of development. 
He remains egotistical, egoistical, self-centred, and asocial. 

At about fourteen, the social semantic period begins, which leads, 
when ‘normal’, to the adult socialized individual 

We should realize that these semantic stages are ‘normal’ when 
they are lived through ivithm the age limits indicated here Even if chil- 
dren show some characteristics which are not desirable (organ erotic or 
autoerotic, narcissistic), this, in itself, does not constitute a danger, 
provided they outgrow these undesirable manifestations The serious 
dangers, and even tragedies, begin when some of the infantile or nar- 
cissistic semantic characteristics are earned over into the life of the 
grown-ups. 

Not only ‘intellectual’ growth but also ‘emotional’ development may 
be arrested on some earlier lower level In such cases we speak of idiots, 
imbeciles, and morons on the ‘mental’ levels, and of moral imbecility, 
infantilism, narcissism, and, in general, of ‘mental’ illness on the ‘emo- 
tional’ levels 

Besides arrested growth, or under-development in some respect, 
cases of so-called regression are frequently encountered Regression fol- 
lows the general scheme as outlined in Fig 1, but in a reversed order. 
The following diagram, Fig 2, is also taken from Jelliffe, with slight 
modifications 


Regression Proftresslon 



As processes, life, development, or regression are best represented 
as ‘vector quantities’ which have direction and magnitude In one tjpe 
of cases of regression the progressive tendency or energy is strong , yet 
the obstacle is also very great, so that the progressive tendencies may not 
be strong enough to carry over the obstacle or to conquer it Again, the 
progressive tendency or energy may be weak, and tlie obstacle corre- 
spondingly slight, yet strong enough to start the regressne movement 
In the healthy individual the progressive tendency is not easily 
diverted from its forward course He conquers his obstacles (C) and 
goes on (arrow A) Weaker individuals (A') may surmount their 
obstacles with more difficulty or may start regression on smaller ob-

Stacies, as indicated by arrows (B) In such cases they may regress to 
different levels, developing a neurosis or a psychosis, in accordance with 
the degree of regression It is extremely instructive to study these dif- 
ferent phases m regression and to watch how the symptoms arrange 
themselves in a perfectly orderly manner In some instances the regres- 
sion goes so far as to bring the patients to the foetal level Such a patient 
sits in a dark corner in the foetal position with the head covered with a 
rag His ‘mentality’ and semantic responses are similar to those of the 
foetus, practically none 

Regressions to the archaic level are usually hopeless of improve- 
ment, so that I shall not analyse them in this work We are mostly 
interested m uuder-development, or in regression not further than to 
the autoerotic or the narcissistic semantic levels, in which treatment in 
many instances yields curative results. 

Jelhffe gives among others a very instructive diagram as a method 
of showing how the personal make-up of an individual can be plotted 
(psychogram) These diagrams afford excellent graphic means for 
orientation One of them I reproduce on the opposite page (Fig 3) ® 

The circular form of the diagram is particularly appropriate, as it 
shows clearly how the horizons, activities, and interests widen from the 
archaic (animaH) through the child and savage, to the adult socialized 
individual The dips in the eye, stomach, and bladder sectors correspond 
to definite symptoms In the eye sector the dip goes to the narcissistic 
semantic level Wheneier this patient is riding m an automobile and 
another car is coming close, so that a collision seems possible, the patient 
experiences a compulsory shutting of the eyes, a typical narcissistic 
semantic symptom which symbolizes that something which one cannot 
see cannot happen The patient did not regress to the organ erotic level 
and become actually blind or deaf (psychic or rather semantic blindness 
or deafness) , so the dips are not plotted to the organ erotic level In 
the bladder and nutritive sectors we see that the curve sinks as low as 
the organ erotic level These dips correspond to striking semantic symp- 
toms When the patient drives in her car and is held by the traffic, she 
has an involuntary passage of urine The dip in the nutritive sector 
corresponds to the symptom that after eating certain foods the patient 
IS able to bring them back into her mouth (selective rumination) 
Analysis by Doctor Jelhffe has revealed that in the case of the passage 
of urine when the patient is held up in traffic, her unconscious organ 
erotic semantic fantasy triumphs over the need for self-control, and 
she asserts her mastery through the early and necessary mastery acquired 
over the control of the bladder Since she is prevented from doing one

Schematic representation of regressions and fixations in one patient The 
dip in the respiratory sector represents a psychogenic asthmatic defence r r, 
in the eye and ear sector, refusing to see or hear the ‘truth’ and ‘reality’ , in the 
genital, urinary eroticism The deep incision in a fairly well socialized nutri- 
tive ‘libido’ represents an ‘emotionally’ conditioned sr for selective rumination 
of individual ingredients m the stomach The patient appears as a severely sick 
individual on the border of a psychotic reaction Present nosological schemes 
would call this an anxiety-hysteria or a manic-depressive psychosis if the 
semantic compensation should break and further regression occur (After 
Jelliffe ) 

thing, her power of doing gets semantic expression through a substitute 
act which cannot be prevented by outside interference The selective 
rumination symptom also goes back to the nursing semantic period. 
When suckling she would vomit after a full meal, and demand another 
nursing, to which the mother foolishly acceded Vomiting then became 
her semantic way of controlling ‘reality’ She used that as a weapon in 
getting her wishes with her family She has amplified and refined the 
methods of semantic expression of this old mastery over ‘reality’, and 
the selective rumination scans one of the results 




498 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


The patient also exhibits other neurotic semantic symptoms She is 
too impatient to read and does not remember what she has read She 
can never remain quiet She is very keen-sighted to find fault in others, 
very acute to hear the last verbal equivocations, and very neat and clean 
w'lth reference to her bodily secretions Here ive see clearly the seman- 
tic mechanism of infantilism and the contradictions between the con- 
scious performance and the unconscious fantasies 

In an hypothetically healthy individual, his make-up could be repre- 
sented graphically by a circle on the social level of adjustment He would 
have outgrown the passing semantic stages of the archaic, organ erotic, 
and narcissistic periods 

Failure in semantic adaptation to ‘reality’ might be represented by 
dips in the cur\e to such a level as the individual fixation or regression 
has put him By such means we have an excellent method to represent 
clearly the weak spots and to show the focal semantic points of conflict 
in evaluation where energy is diverted to useless or harmful fantasy 
ends 

When the dips or deviations are few and slight, we call them idio- 
syncrasies , for instance, such a habit as the narcissistic tactile fantasy of 
toying with a button, a moustache, or eyebrow When the number of 
failures is larger and the semantic symptoms go to lower levels of devel- 
opment, we speak of hysteria,. When the level of regression is still 
lower (organ erotic or archaic), we are usually entitled to speak of a 
psychosis * 

We have already emphasized over and over again that the organism 
works as-a-whole, and that, therefore, any el splittings cannot lead to 
satisfactory results The verbal division of ‘body’ and ‘mind’ remains 
verbal, and also involves a language whose structure does not correspond 
to the structure and functioning of the organism A language is like a 
map , It is not the territory represented, but it may be a good map or a 
bad map If the map shows a different structure from the territory 
represented — for instance, shows the cities in a wrong order, or some 
places east of others while in the actual territory they are west , — then 
the map is worse than useless, as it misinforms and leads astray One 
who made use of it could never be certain of reaching his destination 
The use of el language to represent events which operate as-a-whole is, 
at least, equally misguiding and semantically dangerous '' 

With this in mind, let us briefly analyse the ‘obstacle’ in Fig 2 As 
we deal with ‘obstacles’ in a life sense, we can generalize the obstacle 
to some semantic factors involving meanings and evaluations which may 
arrest the development as well as result in regression. 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


499 


From the non-el point of view every obstacle and difficulty involves 
semantic evaluation Any and all reactions to lower order abstractions 
involve the cyclic chain of higher order abstractions, no matter how 
imperfectly In ordinary language, a physical occurrence with which 
we become acquainted through lower nerve centres involves our ‘men- 
tal’ attitudes, doctrines , m general, s r influenced by the activities of the 
higher centres From this non-el point of view, surprise, fear, fright , 
enter, and usually do the harm Physical pain seldom, if ever, leads to 
semantic disturbances, but fear, fright , and surprise usually do An- 
ticipation of danger, or proper evaluation of a situation, has a protective 
effect, as it usually tends to diminish or abolish the fear, fright , or 
surprise. The outside world is full of devastating energies, and an 
organism may only be called adapted to life when it not only receives 
stimuli but also has protective means against stimuli Now such antici- 
pation or expectation makes an organism prepared, and the difference 
between a prepared and an unprepared organism m the face of danger 
or pain may turn the scale of the outcome 

Section B Consciousness of abstracting 

It IS obvious that m the human organism the field for stimulations 
is vastly greater tlian in animals We are subjected not only to all 
external stimuli but also to a large number of permanently operating 
internal semantic stimuli, against which we have had, as yet, very little 
protective psychophysiological means Such structurally powerful seman- 
tic stimuli are found in our doctrines, metaphysics, language, attitudes , . 
These do not belong to the objective external world, and so the animals 
do not have them in a like degree As our enquiry has shown, m practi- 
cally all ‘mental’ ills, a confusion of orders of abstractions appears as a 
factor When we confuse the orders of abstractions and asciibe objective 
reality to terms and symbols, or confuse conclusions and inferences with 
descriptions . , a great deal of semantic suffering is produced 

Obviously, in such a delusional world, different from the actualities, 
we are not prepared for actualities, and then always something unex- 
pected or ‘frightful’ may happen The organism cannot adjust itself 
to such fictions , it is not prepared to face co-valued ni o realities and 
must suffer from constant surprises and painful semantic shocks, which 
do the harm 

As we have already seen, the general preventive psychophysiological 
discipline in all such cases of confusion of orders of abstractions is found 
m ‘consciousness of abstracting’ When conscious of abstracting we 
cannot identify the symbol with the thing, . In the case j'ust described. 



500 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


the difficulties of the patient were precisely in intensified ims-evaluation 
— ^the confusion of the symbol on the infantile semantic level with m o 
reality — and this persisted, m spite of later serious inconvenience and 
difficulties when the symbol did not any longer produce the desired 
submission of others and became in itself a nuisance 

We could analyse from this semantic point of view all psychiatry, 
and we would find that the intensified mis-evaluation or confusion of 
orders of abstractions is always very prominent in ‘mental’ illnesses 
This characteristic is very general, and the suffering these confusions 
produce is very acute The general protective psychophysiological meas- 
ure, hoM ever, is very simple , namely, ‘consciousness of abstracting’ 

A fundamental difference between ‘man’ and ‘animal’ is found in 
the fact that a man can be conscious of abstracting, and an animal can- 
not This last statement could be reformulated that animals are 
‘unconscious of abstracting’ Now consciousness of abstracting is not 
inborn as a rule, but becomes a sr acquired only by education or through 
very long, and usually painful, experience in evaluation If we are 
imconscious of abstracting, we obviously copy animals in our ‘mental’ 
processes and attitudes and cannot completely adapt ourselves to the 
structurally more complex human world (with higher order abstrac- 
tions), so that some arrested or regressive processes are bound to result. 
In such a more complex world we need protection against semantic over- 
stimulations, which the animals in their simpler world do not need If, 
therefore, we copy animals in our ‘mental’ processes, we could, perhaps, 
live m their simpler world, but cannot adapt ourselves easily to a struc- 
turally more complex human world 

We see here the general semantic mechanism of human adaptation. 
Our human world is more complex , the number of stimuli is enormously 
increased Against this excessive stimulation we need protection, which 
IS found m the consciousness of abstracting One adjusts oneself by 
increasing the field of ‘consciousness’, and by giving it properly evalu- 
ated content as against the vast ‘unconscious’ which covers the animal’s 
life and our own past In ‘mental’ ills we find the arrested or regressive 
stages, with a vast and harmful unconscious ‘Mental’ therapy always 
has the semantic aim and method , namely, to discover the unconscious 
material and make it conscious, and so make proper evaluation possible 
It IS quite remarkable that ‘mental’ therapy, which actually is a form 
of semantic, von-el re-education, is only successful when it succeeds in 
making the patient not only ‘rationalize’ his difficulties but also makes him 
‘emotionally’ revive — live through again, so to say, and evaluate anew — 
his past experiences This process can be compared with a glass of water 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


501 


in which some chalky sediment lies on the bottom In semantic dif- 
ficulties the different ‘hurts’ , may be compared to the water and the 
sediment ‘Rationalization’, alone, is like throwing away the clean water 
and letting the sediment remain No improvement follows , the semantic 
sediment of earlier evaluation is still there and does its work But if we 
stir up the water and the chalk, then we can throw out both and a clear- 
ing up will follow The non-el ‘living through’ of the past experiences 
IS equivalent to this semantic stirnng-up of meanings before eliminating 
the immature evaluations 

This semantic mechanism is w'ell recognized, yet puzzling It shows 
that it IS more difficult to influence the affective than to affect the 
‘rationalization’ One may ‘rationalize’ perfectly well , yet his low'er 
centres will not be affected sufficiently It is possible that the confusion 
of orders of abstractions or identification is, in the mam, responsible for 
it With the use of the Structural Differential and with training in the 
orders of abstractions and m sdence on the objective levels, w'e gain 
seemingly extremely powerful psychophysiological means of an entirely 
general character to influence directly the affective responses, m w’hich 
we are aided by the utilization of all available nerve centres It also 
shows once more how persistent is the working of the orgaiiism-as-a- 
whole The harm was done by oi ganism-as-a-zvlwle methods (affecting 
higher and lower centres), the protective semantic agencies should em- 
ploy similar means 

In the older ‘mental’ therapy we tried to bring the unconscious or 
buried material into the conscious, but each psychiatrist proceeded b\ a 
private method, and according to a special theory Such procedure is 
obviously not general enough for simple preventive training on a large 
scale The present svstem offers such general and effective semantic 
psychophysiological means By making oursehes conscious of abstract- 
ing we prevent the animalistic ««consciousness of abstracting, and so 
prevent arrested development or regression We bring into conscious- 
ness some of the most fundamental human chai acteristics, of which 
animals are ««conscious, and so prevent arrestment or regression to 
lower levels The method is entirely general and simple, based on the 
elimination of identification, introducing natural and so adaptive evalua- 
tion which should not stir up resistance in the child 

In the freudian theory the famous Oedipus complex purported to 
explain the often unconscious hostility of the son toward the father and 
his excessive attachment to the mother The researches of the anthro- 
pologist Malinowski show that in primitive matriarchal societies the 
biological father is not recognized as such and is only a kind of friend 



502 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


and nurse to his son The other functions which the father has in 
patriarchal societies are here performed by the mother’s brother The 
taboos which apply to the mother in patriarchal societies apply to the 
sister in such matriarchal societies 

The results are quite interesting Malinowski found that seem- 
ingly similar unconscious semantic mechanisms are at work But the 
hostility IS toward the uncle, and the excessive attachment is directed 
toward the sister 

Malinowski concludes that the freudian mechanisms are thus proven. 
According to the present theory these facts are very important and show 
clearly that ‘sex’, as such, has nothing or very little to do with these 
‘eomplexes’, but that the active unconscious agents appear as semantic 
and doctrinal Doctrines and their meanings to the individual, their 
applications, identifications , make the father in one case, and the uncle 
m the other, the dreaded , member of the family Because of lack of 
consciousness of abstracting the child reacts to such application of doc- 
trines with some ‘complex’, or semantic state, based on identification, 
non-mature evaluation, involving non-mature non-el meanings, in spite 
of el theories and languages 

Similarly, some spanking or other pain in childhood may later 
result in a neurosis A successful analysis can usually trace neuroses 
back to some such experiences What did the harm ^ Was it the burning 
physical feeling? Obviously not, for any child has had in its childhood 
many more painful experiences, and yet no semantic harm has followed 
So we must look in another direction, and the elimination of identifica- 
tion or of the confusion of order of abstractions at once offers a solution 
The ‘spanking’ had many factors, some of them were ‘physical’, some 
‘mental’ If we consider among the ‘mental’ factors the objectifications 
of ‘authority’, ‘liell’, ‘sin’, and other terms of evaluation, these result in 
fright and other semantic shocks, which ultimately lead to the neurosis 
We know from our own experience how little affected we are by an 
accidental hit Such a purely physical experience which does not give a 
semantic shock cannot product a neurosis 

It IS not difficult to see that an investigation of ‘hurts’, ‘emotional 
shocks’, ‘fear’, ‘fright’, ‘surprise’ , must lead to a more general enquiry 
into the structure of ‘human knowledge’, meanings, evaluation, sr , 
which must include the structure of science and mathematics 

In the disregard of the stratification of human knowledge, or in 
identification or the confusion of orders of abstractions, we find an 
ever-present and abundant semantic source of human suffering, which 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


503 


increases unnecessarily the internal stimulations and so disturbs the 
efficient working of the organism-as-a-uhole 

Ps\ chiatrists in pureh pathological fields have also discovered differ- 
ent sources of human difficulties Ther di«cov ered that the ‘unconscious’ 
seems quite a dangerous affair, and that ‘mental’ ills exhibit symptoms 
of an arrested or regressue process. 

This present mi estigation, as well as the ps} chopathological ones 
here referred to, although conducted on entirely different grounds, one 
more general than the other, has discovered ven,- similar mechanisms , 
namely, the benefit in enlarging the field of ‘consciousness’, by bringing 
into ‘consciousness’ important factors of the ‘unconscious’ and thereby 
counteracting the semantic possibilitj* for arrested development or 
regression 

With such duergence. both in methods and in material used, the 
similarity of results indicates strongh the soundness of the conclusions 
Generaht}' offers, also, a criterion of practical simplicity and workabihtj , 
and on these grounds the more general semantic .-7 discipline commends 
itself. 

Because of this generality the present theory has not only a simple 
but also an impersonal character which makes it available as a preventive 
measure in elementary education \\'ith the older theories we deal in 
practice with personal responses to meanings, m our case we deal with 
the sr m general and with their psjchophysiological mechanism in par- 
ticular 

The present enquiry .started with the search for a sharp difference 
between Fido and Smith This W'as found m the fact that Smith func- 
tions as a ‘time-binder’, while Fido does not Further imesiigation into 
the mechanism of the time-binding function revealed that its most 
important charactenstic is found in its peculiar stratification into many 
orders of abstractions The realization of this -tratification eliminates 
identificabon and leads to the ’consciousness of abstracting’ thus ascrib- 
ing a permanent st) ictly kiiman content to consciousness’, and so auto- 
matically eliminating such animalistic, and. therefore, arresting or 
regressive, ‘miconsciousness It is found, also that in the consciousness 
of abstracting we find a general and simple psychophi siological semantic 
method for the elimination of the majontj of human difficulties In the- 
training in this con^ciousnes' of abstracting we find a workable physio- 
logical tool with which to integrate the functioning of the human ncn.ous 
system. We use organism-as-a-Ahole methods and achie.e organism- 
as-a-whole results We find in the language of ‘semantic reactions’, ‘non- 
elementalistic meanings’., psychophysiological means to integrate the 



504 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


‘emotional’ with the ‘intellectual’, which was hampered, to say the least, 
by the old el languages and methods and systems The organism by 
structural necessity acts as-a-whole, but the old elementahsm with its 
psychophy biological effects prepared the semantic background for split 
personalities, which a non-el system helps to re-mtegrate We find a 
rather astonishing result , namely, that the structure of human achieve- 
ments corresponds to the prmaple of stratification with the resulting 
consciousness of abstracting, usually limited to the special field The 
majority of individual and group difficulties are found, also, to be due 
to the very general disregard of this principle. 

By the scientific data of 1933 it seems well established that the 
enlargement of the field of ‘consciousness’ is extremely desirable With 
this aim, a more general enquiry into the character of the ‘unconscious’ 
may also be worth while Let us investigate the structure of science 
(1933), and see if some ‘unconscious’ factors cannot be found there 
We find a curious fact, that mathematicians, m addition to their other 
activities, make a business of unravelling hidden unconscious assump- 
tions Their enquiries have led to a thorough investigation of the struc- 
ture of their language in two directions one, investigation of the 
underlying assumptions , the other, working out the ‘implications’ 

Let us give a simple structural example of this Two assumptions 
are said to be equivalent when each of them can be deduced from the 
other without the help of additional new assumptions For instance' 
(a) The fifth postulate of Euclid — ‘If a straight line falling on two 
straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two 
right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that 
side on which are the angles less than the two right angles’, (fi) ‘Two 
straight lines parallel to a third are parallel to each other’, (c) ‘Through 
a point outside a straight line one and only one parallel to it can be 
drann’ Each assumption silently, unconsciously, presupposes the other, 
so that they can be deduced from each other They actually are different 
forms of the same propositional function 

Another case is equivalence relatively to a fundamental set of as- 
sumptions A, B, C, M It might happen that, m diminishing the fun- 
damental set, two assumptions which were formerly equivalent cease to 
be so For instance, the following assumptions are mutually equivalent 
and also equivalent to the fifth postulate of Euclid (a) ‘The internal 
angles, which two parallels make with a transversal on the same side, are 
supplementary’ (Ptolemy) (&) ‘Two parallel straight lines are equi- 
distant ’ (c) ‘If a straight line intersects one of two parallels, it also 
intersects the other ’ (Proclus ) (d) ‘A triangle being given, another 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


505 


triangle can be constructed similar to the given one and of any size what- 
ever.’ (Wallis ) (c) "ihrough three points, not lying on a straight line, 
a sphere can always be drawn ' (W Bolyai) , 

But the following two assumptions are only equivalent to the E 
fifth postulate if we retain the postulate of Archimedes* (a) ‘The locus 
of the points w hich are equidistant from a straight line is a straight line’ , 
(b) ‘The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles ’ 
(Saccheri )* 

The crucial point of this discussion is that all that has been said here 
IS not obvwiis even to the attentive and intelligent reader, nor to many 
mathematicians It took nearly two thousand years and some rjf the 
efforts of the best scientists of the world to discover these connections 
and implications The above examples illustrate a general underlying 
structure of all our languages They hav'e inherent interconnection, un- 
derlying assumptions and implications, the analysis of which, outside of 
mathematics, is seldom, if ever, carried far enough Now these structural 
assumptions and implications are inside of our skin when we accept a 
language — any language If unravelled, they become conscious, if not, 
they remain unconscious. In the present w ork we ha\ e already had an 
opportunity to become acquainted with unconscious implications which 
are concealed m the structure of any language W'e saw that we must 
start with undefined terms, which represent structural assumptions and 
postulates, as we have no means to explain them or define them at a 
given date We found that these undefined terms represented our un- 
conscious metaphysics, and that the way to make this unconscious 
metaphysics conscious was to start explicitly with undefined terms, pro- 
duce a system of postulates , a procedure which is completely' fulfilled 
only in mathematics 

It should be noticed f as this is very important i that the undefined 
terms, being undefined, are overloaded with 'emotional’ values As the 
higher nerv'ous centre* cannot handle them the lower nerve centre* w ork 
upon them overtime If we do not analyse our languages into their 
undefined terms and structural postulates, our strongest ‘emotional’ and 
semantic components, which made these languages, remain hidden and 
unconscious 

*The Postulate of Archimedes is stated by Hilbert thu* Let be any point 
upon a straight line between the arbitranlj chosen points A and B Take the pennts 
A„ A„ . so that he* between A and .1, between and A, , moreover, 
let the segments AA^ A^A, A_A, be all eriual Then_ among this senes of 
points, there alwajs exists a certain point An. such that B lies between A and An. 

This hypothesis is used by Saccheri m its intuitive form: namely, a s^metit, 
which passes continuously from the length a to the length 6, different from 0, takes, 
during Its variation, every length intermediate between a and 6 ‘

VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


Here we are face to face for the first ‘time’ w ith a wider, more gen- 
eral, and impersonal ‘unconscious’, which underlies the structure of any 
language, and so is operatue in every one who uses a language We 
may call this general form the scientific, or public, or linguistic, or seman- 
tic. or bi preference, as a term, the structural uucoiiscioits It embodies 
the underlying structural assumptions and implications w'hich are silently 
hidden behind our languages and their structures These assumptions . , 
may be called ‘unconscious’, because they are totally unknown and un- 
suspected, unless uncovered after painful research 

Any form of representation has its ow'n structural assumptions at its 
basis, and when we accept a language we unconsciously accept sets of 
silent structural assumptions of which we become semantic victims For a 
long while, the white race has been the Mctim of the unconscious assump- 
tions and metaphysics which underlie the A. E. and X s% stems It has 
needed a structural reMSion of these S3 stems, culminating in E, X, and, 
finally, A systems These non-systems are characterized not by the 
introduction of new assumptions, but b} making the older unjustified, 
primitne, unconscious structural assumptions conscious and so helping 
us in eliminating the semaiiticall) undesirable reactions We ha^ e already 
seen how' fallacies and taboos (1933) can be and were manufactured 
unconsciously by semantic processes . these start w ith more general more 
natural and more fundamental structural errors, such as the primitive 
‘identification’, for instance, w'hich are due to pre-human ways of ‘think- 
ing’ and which result m semantic difficulties and regression even todai 
Let us assume, as an illustration, that the fifth postulate of Euclid 
IS a false assumption seriously detrimental to human life and comparable 
to some of the false doctrines that underlie the morbid sj’mptoms wdth 
which psj'chiatrists deal ever\ day Let us assume, further that a doctor 
Ignorant of the structure of ‘human knowledge’ s r, and the equnalence 
of assumptions, succeeds, after painful and laborious efforts in eliminat- 
ing from a patient this special viaous assumption Yet, because of his 
oversight, he pajs no attention to another assumption equi\alent to the 
first, and does not eliminate it In such a case, rationalization about the 
first false doctrine w'ould probabh' make the treatment a failure, as the 
other unconscious and equnalent doctrine would, in virtue of the ex- 
tremely formal, one-, and two-valued character of the unconscious, per- 
form Its task and make the treatment ineffective The tangle of equi\ alent 
structural assumptions in daih' life is still unanah’sed For instance, it 
is extremely difficult to attempt to impart ‘proper evaluation’ wdthout 
eliminating identification , . 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


507 


The higher and lower order abstractions seem structurally and 
neurologically, as well as functionally, interconnected in a cyclic chain, 
and so can never be entirely divided A language — any language — in- 
volves undefined terms which, with the structure of the given language, 
express the silent and unconscious metaphysics underlying it A lan- 
guage, for Its maximum serviceability, must, at least have the structuie 
of the events it attempts to describe, and so science must first discover 
the structure of events, for only then can we shape our languages and 
give them the necessary structure Any advance in our knowledge of 
nature is strictly connected with new languages of similar structure 
which reflect the structure of the world This last ‘knowledge’ at each 
date represents again ‘modern metaphysics’ In all such enquiries we 
have to struggle with the older, mostly primitive structural metaphysics 
and unconscious linguistic semantic consequences Enquiry into these 
subjects must throw new light on the unconscious processes, and so 
diminish the vast field of the unconscious 

The structural unconscious seems to be more general, more fun- 
damental than the special, or individual, psychiatrical one, because 
analysis shows that the latter follows from the former As the reader 
may recall, life, ‘intelligence’, and abstracting in different orders started 
together Without abstracting, recognition, and, therefore, selection 
would not be possible The world of the animal, as well as of man, 
represents ^nothing else than the stiuctural results of abstracting, without 
which life itself would be totally impossible Man alone has the power 
of extending the orders of abstractions indefinitely When Smith has 
produced an abstraction of some order, perhaps by making a statement, 
he has the potential capacity of analysing and contemplating this state- 
ment, which has become a fact on record, and so he can abstract to 
a still higher order , without known limits It is this capacity which 
crowds the world of Smith with endless ‘facts’ belonging to very 
different orders of absti actions The animal's capacity for abstracting 
ceases on some level, and is never extended without a change m the 
nervous structure So the animars world is comparatively simple, the 
world structure of man being, by comparison, indescribably more com- 
plex Man’s problems of adjustment, therefore, also become more com- 
plex Human medicine is much more complex than veterinary science, 
although the higher animals differ very little m their gross anatomical 
structure from humans The structural m o facts, which resulted from 
abstracting in different orders, differ in number as well as in complexity 
The human capacity for expanding indefinitely the orders of abstrac- 
tions brings about this peculiar stratification of ‘human knowledge’

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


It appears as a product of evolution just as stratified as rocks appear. 
This stratification appears as a crucial, structural m o fact, though gen- 
erally disregarded, except partially m mathematics and psychiatry Its 
realization necessitates the elimination of the ‘is’ of identity and results 
in the consciousness of abstracting, so fundamental for sanity. 

Section C Infantilism 

As has already been mentioned, the mam symptoms of physical and 
‘mental’ illnesses are few and simple This would suggest the possibility 
of simple and more general theories relating to the fundamental symp- 
toms The colloidal structure of protoplasm accounts for this peculiar 
simplicity and for the small number of the fundamental symptoms In 
the ‘mental’ field these fundamental symptoms are accounted for by a 
simple structural, functional principle of ‘copying animals’ m our 
nervous processes, which must be harmful, and which is characterized 
by the lack of consciousness of abstracting, implying colloidal disturb- 
ances Psychogalvanic experiments show clearly that every ‘emotion’ or 
‘thought’ IS always connected with some electrical currents, and that 
electricity seems fundamental for colloidal behaviour, and, therefore, for 
physical symptoms and the behaviour of the organism 

In the colloidal processes we find the bridge between the ‘physical’ 
and the ‘mental’, and the mutual link seems mainly electricity It is more 
than mere coincidence that all illnesses, ‘physical’ or ‘mental’^ have only 
a few fundamental symptoms , and we should no longer be surprised to 
find that physical ills result in ‘mental’ symptoms, and that ‘mental’ ills 
may also involve ‘physical’ symptoms 

If a simple sjmptom is completely general, it indicates that it is 
structurally fundamental, and we shall be repaid if we devote special 
attention to it As a rule, m ‘mental’ ills we observe a striking appear- 
ance of symptoms which have a sinister parallel with the behaviour of 
infants Arrested development or regression in grown-ups also exhibits 
these infantile characteristics In other words, whenever infantile char- 
acteristics appear in grown-ups it indicates that the ‘adult’ has not grown 
up fully in some semantic respects, or has already started on the way 
of regression, implying some colloidal or m o structural injury 

When we speak of ‘infantilism’ m ‘adults’, we include symptoms 
which belong to the period of childhood m its organ erotic or autoerotic 
and narcissistic stages It should be recalled that m children these 
semantic phases are natural, they become pathological only when the 
individual does not outgrow them and exhibits them as a grown-up The 
term ‘infantilism’ is a rather sinister one, and should never be applied to 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY

children Children behave like children, and that ends the subject But 
children have fewer responsibilities, their sex impulses are undeveloped , 
and so their behaviour cannot be equally dangerous to themselves and 
others But not so with grown-ups They have responsibilities, duties, 
often strong sex impulses , which make out of the infantile ‘adult’ an 
individual dangerous to himself and others The term ‘social’ period, or 
‘socialized’ individual, is sometimes wrongly interpreted The fact that 
human achievements and capacities are accumulative and depend on 
achievements of others makes us, by necessity, a social time-bmding 
class of life, which again involves more complex modes of adjustment 
Whether we approve or disapprove the existing legal and jiolice regula- 
tions has nothing to do with the fact that m a social class of life some 
restrictions are necessary Our present commercial ‘civilization’ can be 
characterized as of an infantile type, governed mostly by structurally 
primitive mythologies and language very often involving primitive sr 
One need but read the speeches of different merchants, presidents, and 
kings to be thoroughly convinced of this The rules and regulations are 
naturally antiquated, and belong to the period to which the underlying 
metaphysics and language belong The ‘adult’ or scientific semantic stage 
of civilization would be precisely the ‘social’ stage of complete evaluation 
of our privileges and duties 

In speaking about infantilism, it should be remembered that the 
child has an advantage over the imbeciles, idiots, and ‘mentally’ ill who 
have stopped development or have regressed to the age of the infant or 
the child The ‘normal’ child profits by experience and outgrows the 
semantic characteristics that are natural to a given age In cases of 
arrested development or regression, the undesirable infantile chaiacter- 
istics persist in the grown-ups and are a source of endless difficulties and 
suffering to them and their associates Thus, in our childhood we all 
have had experiences similar to that of the patient of Dr Jelliffe, and 
are no worse off because of them But, if the reader should imagine 
himself in the position of the patient with those infantile characteristics, 
he would realize that an enormous amount of suffering, fear, shame, 
bewilderment , results for the patient The worst feature in such cases 
IS found in the fact that an infantile type usually cannot ‘outgrow’ or 
alter such characteristics by himself, and needs very wise and patient 
outside help in re-training, or medical assistance, if he is ever to over- 
come earlier inappropriate j r But if we start the education of an infant 
with appropriate j r, such a procedure must play a most important pre- 
ventive evaluational role.

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


We should remember that the nervous system of the human child 
IS not finished at birth 'I he extension, the growth, and the multiplica- 
tion of the appendages of the neurones , go on after birth The nervous 
S}Stem of an adult shows striking differences m the length and com- 
plexity of the nerve cells over that of the infant The researches of 
Hamniarberg show'ed, m all the cases of idiocy he investigated, an arrest 
of development in a moie or less large part of the cortex, at a stage 
corresponding to either an embryological period, or to the period of 
early infancy Only a small number of cells had reached their full de- 
\elopment during the growth of the cortex The psycho-logical defects 
w^ere m direct proportion to the defects of the development of the cells, 
and w'ere the greater the earlier the period of arrest of development ® 
In extreme congenital imbecility the cortex is poorly organized, is thin 
and deficient in nerve cells Bolton’s second layer of pyramidal cells 
matures last, and its development m different mammals corresponds to 
the degree of their ‘intelligence’ In humans, its degree of deficiency 
corresponds to the degree of ‘mental’ arrest or regression In organic 
‘mental’ diseases very diffuse cortical lesions, when present, impair ‘intel- 
ligence’ Affective disturbances depend upon even smaller brain lesions, 
particularly when the thalamic regions are affected ^ In general, lesions 
in the basal ganglia diminish the energy of the impulsive life (sleeping 
sickness) Lesions at the base of the frontal lobe, and some brain 
tumours, lead to euphoric excitement, which gives a feeble, stupid expres- 
sion, facetiousness, and a tendency to teasing Other lesions in the basal 
ganglia lead to a labile affectivity All destructions of parts of the brain 
usually lead to irritability and moodiness In different focal lesions of 
the brain the disturbances lead to anger and rage ® 

Among other results of organic brain diseases w^e find semantic dis- 
turbances, absence of critical faculty, and a disturbance of judgement, 
complicated situations can no longer be grasped, the evaluation of rela- 
tions IS impaired , In cases of labile affectivity the special ‘emotion’ 
dominates the patient completely Trifles make him either very happy 
or desperate Because of the decrease in association or deficiency in the 
process of relating, the patient often appears indifferent, although the 
defect IS not primarily m the affective field Similar difficulties m asso- 
ciation or relating make many patients appear egotistic m their s r and 
behaviour Since the patients have lost their insight in, and evaluation 
of, different life situations, their actions appear un-ethical Tenderness, 
consideration, tact, aesthetic sensibility, sense of duty, sense of right, 
feeling of shame , may all disappear at any moment, though they would 
otherwise naturally be present Any kind of impulse may be translated

into action without restraint ” Hemorrhages in the thalamic region often 
result in marked lability of affects Diffuse nutritional disturbances of 
the cortex usually give similar symptoms, as in organic brain diseases , 

It should be remembered that m the human nervous system the 
co-ordinated working of the higher and lower centres is a necessity for 
the optimum working of the whole In cats and dogs deprived of the 
association areas of the cortex, the difference is not so marked They 
still behave in a co-ordinated way, proiided the thalamic regions are 
intact Even in a child without a cortex, we find facial grimaces if we 
give him something bitter, but higher adj ustments are impossible The 
general ‘inhibitory’ and regulative action of the higher centies increases 
with the differentiation of the nervous sj’stem , and in man this becomes 
of paramount importance This has been shown empirically For in- 
stance, in man and dogs strong negative action on the flow of gastric 
juices may be ‘psychic’ in origin This negative action is weak in the 
guinea pig, although it is discovered on decerebration Witb the tortoise, 
also, there is some acceleration of the movements of the stomach after 
decerebration, but in a frog we do not find any negative influence 
at all 

The facts given above were established through anatomical and 
physiological structural examinations If the functioning of the nervous 
system is examined from the point of view of colloidal chemistry, the 
gross non-surgical lesions become interpretable as the result of changes m 
colloidal behaviour Thus Doctors Wilder D Bancroft, J Holmes Rich- 
ter, H Beckett Lang, John A Paterson, Walter Freeman, and others 
demonstrated that it is possible to find a correlation between the func- 
tional psychoses and the state of dispersion of the nerve colloids For 
instance, in dementia praecox the nervous system appears in a state of 
colloidal over-dispersion , and in manic depiessive psjehoses, in a state 
of decreased dispersion It is interesting to note that in infants tlie 
colloids appear more dispersed than in grown-ups and probably similar 
conditions null be found in cases of infantilism The above-mentioned 
scientists have found, also, that the colloidal behaMOur of the nerious 
system can be altered by special chemical treatment with drugs, carbon 
dioxide, oxygen , with specific reactions on the psycho-logical level As 
sr involve electrical occurrences fundamental m colloidal behaiiour, 
similar sj mptoms on psj cho-logical lei els may imply corresponding sub- 
microscopic colloidal states Taking into consideration the structural 
characteristics of colloidal behaviour and the elaboration of technical 
means, we may discover that semantic re-education must involve differ- 
ences in electrical potentials , and result in differences in colloidal be-

haviour in different regions of the nervous system Experiments should 
be made m combining chemical means, which effects are not lasting but 
which might facilitate the semantic approach with semantic re-education 
which results, once achieved, often become lasting Colloidal and psycho- 
galvanic investigations of a given patient before and after the semantic 
re-education should also be made 

Let me emphasize once more that from the colloidal point of view 
free from identification, the ‘body-mind' pioblcm ceases to be a puzzle, 
as we have a well-established electrodj namic, stiuctiiral colloidal back- 
ground which can account perfectly for the experimental facts of ‘mind’ 
The subtleties of the sub-microscopic structure involve an endless ai i ay 
of possibilities At present we lack detailed knowledge of this structuie , 
for the colloidal developments are \er\' recent, and m this speci.il field 
1 er}- little experimentation has been done 

If we accept the noii-d point of view, and all known eiidence 
seems to demand it. we must conclude that if difi'crent niaci oscopic. 
microscopic, and sub-microscopic lesions of the nerxous s\stem icvdt in 
quite definite pS) cho-logical symptoms, which on the semantic levels 
appear as a lack of evaluation of relations, then mcc \ersa. the use ot 
linguistic s) stems, w'hich s) stemalically tiain the immature ncrious S}S- 
tem of the child and of the grow’ii-ups in delusional evaluation, must result 
in at least colloidal disturbances of the ner\ ous s> stem These functional 
colloidal disturbances become superimposed upon the inboin eientual 
deficiencies of the nervous system, and the end-results may be quite out 
of proportion to the seemingly slight induced discrepancy The actual 
behaviour, adjustment, sanity , may be considerably impaired 

Before birth, the child can be considered as in ideal conditions. He 
floats comfortably in a fluid of a temperatiiie equal to his own All his 
wants are satisfied, as everjtlnng is supplied to him by the maternal 
body. At birth, the child miust begin to breathe, and a little later he must 
take food, digest , External influences begin to impinge on him, and 
he must begin to adjust himself Very soon the average infant finds that 
he can get what he wants, within certain limits, by ccitain movements 
or by cr>ing For the infant, a cry or a word becomes semantic magic 
In Pavlov’s language, a w'ord governs a conditional reflex In psychiatry, 
a definite scries of such conditional t r of animalistic low order of con- 
ditionality IS called a ‘complex’ In Pailov’s experiments a dog is showm 
food and a bell rung simultaneously At the sight of food, sain a and 
gastric juice flow Associations soon relate the ringing of the bell and 
the food, and, later, simply the ringing of the bell will produce the 
flow In another animal some other signal, a whistle, for instance, would

513 


produce similar effects In different people, through experience, associa- 
tions, relations, meanings, and j r are built around some symbol Obvi- 
ously, in grown-up humans the identification of the symbol with the 
thing must be pathological But in infancy the confusion of orders of 
abstractions must be considered as an entirely natural semantic period 
The infant ‘knows’ nothing about science and events Objects and ‘sense 
perceptions’ ‘are’ the only ‘reality’ he knows and cares about , so he does 
not and cannot discriminate between events and objects By necessity, 
he identifies unknowingly two entirely different levels As his symbol 
usually means a satisfaction of his wants, naturally he identifies the sym- 
bols with the objects and events At this stage, also, he cannot know 
that the orders of his abstractions can be extended indefinitely, or that 
his most important terms have the multiordmal character It is impor- 
tant to notice that objectification, and, in general, identification or con- 
fusion of orders of abstractions, are semantically iiaiiiral for the infant 
The more the child comes in touch with ‘reality’, the more he learns, and 
m a ‘normal’ child the ‘pleasure principle’, which was established as a 
method of adjustment on the infantile level, is slowly displaced by the 
‘reality principle’, which thus becomes the semantic method of adjust- 
ment of the complete adult Science alone gives us full knowledge of 
current ‘reality’ But science represents a social achievement, and, there- 
fore, a complete adult, in growing up to the social level, must become 
aware of the latest stages of m o reality These are given by the current 
scientific methods and structural notions about this world, and gradually 
become incorporated m the structure of the language we use, always 
deeply affecting our j r 

It IS important that m the twentieth century we should realize that 
the work of Einstein and the four-dimensional space-time continuum 
establishes a language of different structure, closer to the facts we know 
in 1933, and that it gives us a new semantic method of adjustment to a 
new ‘reality’ (see Part IX) 

The semantic stages of the development of the child must naturally 
pass through the stages outlined above When he begins to differentiate 
himself from the environment, he is self-centred and concentrated on his 
‘sensations’ (autoerotic) Later he projects Ins own sensations on the 
outside events, he personifies This semantic tiait is ofien found in 
incomplete adults, when in anger they bieak dishes or furniture 

The child is interested, first, m himself (autoerotic) , then m chil- 
dren like himself (homosexual) Slowly his interests turn away to 
persons less similar to himself, to the opposite sex, and so he enteis the 
semantic period of the race development 

33 



514 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


Similar semantic processes are to be seen in the racial developments 
as given bj- anthropolog} , and are reflected in the structure of the lan- 
guages. In the archaic period of one-valued 'pre-logical thinking’, which 
IS found among primitive peoples, the ‘consciousness of abstracting’ is 
practically ml The effect produced by something upon an indnidual 
inside his skin is projected outside his skin, thus acquiring a demonic 
semantic character The ‘idea’ of an action or object is identified with 
the action or the object itself Identification and confusion of orders of 
abstractions haie full sway 

The paralogical stage is a little more advanced In it the identifica- 
tion is based on similarities, and differences are neglected (not con- 
sciously, of course) Levy-Bruhl describes this primitive semantic period 
by formulating the ‘law of partiapation’, by which all things which have 
similar characteristics 'at e the same’ “ A primitn e syllogism runs some- 
nhat as follows ‘Certain Indians run fast, stags run fast, therefore, 
some Indians are stags’ This semantic process was entirely natural at an 
early stage and laid a foundation for the building of language and higher 
order abstractions We proceeded by similarities, much too often con- 
sidered as identities, with the result that differences were neglected But. 
in actual life, without some primitive metaphysics, w'e do not find iden- 
tities, and differences become as important as similarities The former 
pnmitne emphasis on identity, later enlarged to similarities, must, at 
some stage of human deiclopmcnt, become semantically disastrous and 
the optimum adjustment an .mpossibihtt 

In building a H-sj.stem. we ha\e to stress differences, build a ‘non- 
system’ on ‘non-allncss’, and reject identity The older semantic inclina- 
tions and infantile or primit>e tendencies were a necessary step in 
human esolution For ssnit; . v.e rsj-t outgrow these infantile semantic 
fixations Sim.iiarly, for cis lI-zaTion, we must grow out from primitive 
structural fixation^, primitive metaphssics, taboos, and other primitive 
sr These ymiinitivc habits, language"^, and structural metaphysics and 
reactions have been extremely ingrained in us through the ages, and y 
requires effort and new semantic training to overcome them 

In the ‘mentall) ’ ill w'e find sinister and very close parallels to the , 
behaviour of the primitive man and the infant, not on’ ' in the ‘mental’ 
and ‘emotional’ responses, but even in physical beh^ \Dur, postures, 
drawings, and other modes of expression These para. Is are today 
recognized by practically all scientific workers and are analysed in many 
excellent volumes 

We should notice that m this maze of observational material, one 
general rule holds; namely, ‘consciousness of abstracting’ offers a full

semantic solution In it we find not only a complete foundation for a 
theory of sanity, but also the semantic, psychophjsiological mechanism 
for the passing from the infantile, or primitive-man, level to the higher 
level of complete adulthood and civilized social man 

The following draumg is taken from Rleuler’s Textbook of Psychi- 
atry (p 402) and uas made by a verj^ ill patient (chronic catatonic) 
who could formerly draw well, jet this drawing is obiiously childish 
The literature of psy- 
chiatry abounds in such 
productions, and they 
confirm fully the pro- 
cesses as described in 
psjchiatry 

Adult infantilism 
becomes usually a potent 
wrecker of individual 
lives, and, t\’hen viewed 
from a social, national, 
or international point 
of view, accounts, also, 
for the majority of our 
semantic difficulties in 
the social, economic, 
and political fields 

Although we treat 
infantile, arrested, and 
regressive symptoms to- 
gether, it IS important 
to realize that most of 
these characteristics are 
normal with the primi- 
tive man, and the infant, 
provided the child out- 
grows them The differ- Fig 4

development and regression seems somewhat like that between a poor 
man and one who has lost his fortune In the first case, the functioning 
of the nervous sj'stem is unsatisfactory through some deficiency, in the 
second, the potentialities for efficient working were there, but some 
semantic obstacle originated the regression, or else some degenerative

VII THE MECHANISM OF TII^IE-BIXDING 


In the field of higher abstractions the train of ‘ideas’ of children, 
imbeciles, and idiots is restricted Uncommon ‘ideas’ are left out, and 
only those which originated in immediate ‘sense perception’ are easily 
grasped Until lately, eien in science, such an attitude was noticeable 
as, for instance in gross empiricism, or in the case of the physicist 
already mentioned who w as willing to ‘fight’ to prove that he ‘saw’ the 
‘electron’. He did not realize that inferential entities are just as good 
abstractions as those he ‘sees’ The attitude of the ‘practical man' who 
pooh-poohs science and the ‘highbrows’ may serve also as an example 
Children, idiots, and imbeciles cannot comprehend anj-thmg com- 
plicated , they see some elements, but miss the relative tvholes. We have 
elaborated a racial language of ‘senses’ and elementalism. Similarly, m 
schizophrenics the relative whole is disregarded, while, on the other 
Itand a single semantically effectii'e characteristic is sufficient to connect 
the most heterogeneous abstractions in an unnatural whole Word- 
relations have a predominance over actualities (identification). Thus 
3 patient looks anxiously at a moving door and exclaims ‘Da ft-essen mich 
Thureii’* and refuses to pass through the door-w'ay Here we see 
the I'deiitification of words with obj'ects carried to the limit In general, 
the j ) of the schizophrenic seem such that he identifies intensely his 
higher aUistractions w ith the low er “ 

Much «xcelleiit material on infantilism can be found in Dr Joseph 
Collins 7 he l^octor Looks at Lozv and Life, particularly in his chapter 
on .Adult Infant..]isiji_ from which much of the following material is 
taken, and which 1 <acknowIcdge gratefully

proper evaluation and becomes a semantic characteristic of maturitv' and 
that, generally, it is more bcncliaal m the long run They thrive and 
thrill on commendations and compliments, and shiver and shrink at dis- 
approval Such characteristics are found even in whole nations The}

are self-satisfied, and keep aloof from others m international affairs, not 
realizing that this is impossible, and that the attempt is ultimately harm- 
ful to them. They assume, as an excuse, the superiority of their institu- 
tions , and the ‘righteousness’ of their own conduct 

Children and superior idiots appreciate resemblances more readily 
than differences Simple generalizations are possible, but often they are 
hasty and faulty A child’s pride and self-respect are hurt if he is con- 
sidered different from other children, or is dressed differently Original- 
ity and individuality are tabooed among children Because of semantic 
undevelopment, differences become a disturbing factor to them, they 
want everything standardized On national grounds, the adult infants 
standardize all they can and haie e\en a kind of hostility to anything 
which has an individual flavour For instance, those who wear straw 
hats after an arbitrary date are attacked on the streets Not wanting to 
‘think’, or to bother about differences, they fancy that they can regulate 
life by legislation and they keep busy manufacturing ‘laws’, which aie 
very often Impracticable and self-contradictory. When they pass sev- 
eral thousand ‘laws’ a jear, these become a maze and a joke The ulti- 
mate semantic result of such over-legislation is a complete lack of justice 
or of any respect for ‘law’ Not being able to ‘think’ for themselves, 
they leave that bothersome function to politicians, priests, newspaper- 
men , . Under such conditions life is impossible without expensive 
lawyers 

Not having the critical semantic capacity for proper evaluation, their 
likes and dislikes are very intense They cannot dift'ercntiate the essen- 
tial from the unimportant The immediate ‘sense’ perception or ‘emo- 
tion’ unduly influences their actions Impulses to copy others dominate 
them They are often prejudiced This results in w'eak judgement, over- 
suggestiveness, ‘emotional’ outbreaks, exaggerated sensibility, variability 
of affective states , and, finally, in an attitude tow'aid life devoid of 
proper evaluation Their moods are changeable , their attention readily 
gained and as readily diverted They become easily intimidated and 
frightened, and easily influenced by others 

The above semantic characteristics are sponsored by commercialism, 
and build up the kind of methods, advertisements, and business policies 
which w'e see about us This also introduces a semantic factor of disin- 
tegration into human relationships, as it leads to methods of tricker}-. to 
‘putting something over’ on the other fellow', and appeals to self-indul- 
gence , . When such commercial tactics arc national, their sinistei educa- 
tional effect IS pronounced Children, from the age when they begin 
to read, are impressed by such practices as normal and take them as

semantic standards for their own further orientations Unfortunately 
even psychiatrists have not, as j^et, anahsed the semantic influence of 
such advertisements on the buildmg and presen ing of infantile char- 
acteristics 

Children lack moderation and a semantic sense of proper evaluation 
Tolerance is not one of their characteristics To them persons and ‘ideas' 
are evaluated in extremes, either good, ‘wonderful’, or bad. ‘terrible’ 
Their j r appear dogmatic and stubborn, as in all the unexperienced 
They talk too much or are silent, they praise too much or blame too 
much they work too hard or plaj’ too hard, and know no middle ground 
The whole life of a nation may be coloured by such semantic attitudes 
Nations become boastful of their own possessions and achievements, and 
happily borrow and forget the achievements of others The}' pride them- 
selves on having the largest airships, the largest cities, the highest build- 
ings, the longest bridges . They know no moderation in food or drink, 
they eat or drink too much or become total ‘prohibitionists’. They ex- 
hibit quick friendships and quick dislikes They are solemn in their 
games, like children nho are playing father and mother, and make out 
of games a national event The childish pleasure of defeating an adver- 
sarj accounts for national crazes, like racing, boxing, football, baseball, 
and similar sports, which often overshadow m public attention all really 
important issues 

Children and man} idiots are incapable of any choice w hich involves 
meanings and evaluation When confronted with a situation in which 
they hav e to choose between two alternatives, they have difficulties, and 
often want both Similarly with ‘ideas’, they often keep sets of entirel} 
self-contradictor} ‘ideas' Even scientists of an infantile t}'pe do so, and 
then publish ‘manifestos' in which they try to justify such behaviour and 
semantic attitudes Merchants tram salesmen especially to induce cus- 
tomers w ith such infantile sr to buy what they do not need This atti- 
tude IS often extended to marriage Any man and woman may marr} 
simply because they come across each other , then, when they meet some- 
body else, they soon change the object of their sentiments 

All classes of feeble-minded and children show marked credulity, 
they like fairy tales and fantastic stories Free inventions, by a process 
of objectification, are taken as experience Children and schizophrenics 
pun and play on zvords They build up languages of their own Per- 
severation and stereot}py in speech are also found among them National 
commercialism utilizes this principle in advertisements and tries to run 
a country by verbal slogans and play on words.

M<my children and feeble-minded show distinct acquisitiveness 
Like some animals, they show a tendencj for collection of objects, and 
value their collections highly It is a well-known childish game to claim 
the best morsel of some food because one has put one's hand on it first 
Acquisitiveness is made a national slogan and proclaimed a higliest aim, 
which, of course, becomes a semantic source of endless wais and mis- 
eries Infantile legalistic ‘putting hands first’, on a piece of paper as a 
title to land, or some such similar form of a ‘claim’, becomes a source of 
ridiculous fortunes for the few and of unbearable life-conditioiis for 
the many 

Children are gregarious and afiaid to be alone Similar tendencies 
are carried on by Rotary and other clubs and lodges Infantile growm- 
ups are too empty in their heads to desire to be alone Childien seldom 
stick to anything for long They hunt for new excitements, and the old 
toys are often soon forgotten Similarly, grown-up infants hunt for new 
excitements, for new toys, whether they be a house or an automobile, a 
wife or a lover 

In children and the feeble-minded, w'e seldom find such feelings as 
shame, aesthetic sentiments, or appieciation of beauty They like things 
bizarre, grotesque, glittering, and enormous, things w'hich attract and 
hold their attention Similar characteristics arc found m incomplete 
adults Children and the feeble-minded arc usually untidy and nois)’’ 
Visiting a public park, or witnessing a ‘cclcbi ation’, w ill show' an observer 
clearly how infantile grown-ups behave 

Children like to domineer over their younger brothers and sisters 
and to play the leading part in a game Similar semantic chai actci istics 
are carried into adult life, sometimes taking the form of sadism We 
often see infantile docility or resentment, as expressed in sentimental 
approval or bitter disillusionment, both generally unjustified 

Self-respect is little developed in the idiot, but plays an important 
semantic role in the life of imbeciles and children The infantile adult 
also show's an exaggerated self-respect Bus conductors and univcisity 
professors label themselves with a title — even if it is only 'Air’ John 
Smith, as if being called simply ‘John Smith’ w'ould be offensive to him 
An adult evaluates a man by what he has in his head or chaiacter, but 
the infantile type largely judges him by the symbols (monej') w'hich he 
has, or the kind of hat or clothes he wears Since commercialism cannot 
sell brains, but can sell trousers or a dress, it establishes semantic 
standards whereby a man is evaluated by his clothes and hats 

In speaking of exaggerated self-regard based on improper self- 
evaluation, we touch the problems of infantile self-love and self-impor- 



520 


VIT THE ilECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


tance Infantile grown-ups carry these even further, and are unable to 
make dependable attachments to other persons The love of parents 
toward their child is largely because it is their child, and infantile A 
‘loves’ B only because B ‘adores’ A and gives up his individuality The 
moment something changes in B, all the ‘love’ A had disappears The 
unbelievable bitterness which appears in divorce-court scenes shows 
clearly the value of infantile ‘love’ Such ‘love’ is often based on purely 
egoistic grounds They ‘love’ what they represent to themselves, what 
they once represented, ivhat they would like to represent Infantile 
parents see all kinds of perfections in their babies, although a sober out- 
sider does not share these opinions An infantile mother treats her child 
like a doll, plaj s and is thrilled with it, but soon gets tired as the respon- 
sibilities become irksome An infantile father sees in the child, first, a 
toy, and, later, a nuisance 

Infantile adults have little regard for, or endurance of, life respon- 
sibilities They tire quickly, are easily discouraged and frightened They 
are thus irresponsible, unreliable, and a source of suffering for those 
connected with or dependent on, them This permanent suspense for 
others produces, perhaps, one of the most serious sources of worries and 
unhappiness Since it is persistent, it gives continual, painful nervous 
shocks, the cumulative effect of W'liich is bound to be harmful 

The infantile individual himself cannot fail to notice that something 
IS wrong, for life makes him quickly aware of it But, in his self-love, 
exaggerated self-esteem , he overlooks his own shortcomings, and 
lilames everybody and everything but himself In the face of ‘injustice’, 
he becomes discouraged, timid, or bitter and pessimistic He is unable 
to discharge his duties and becomes a disappointment as a father, hus- 
band, friend, and, ultimately, as a human being and citizen Bitterness, 
disappointment, and painful semantic shocks pile up on all sides under 
such conditions 

One of the important characteristics of infantilism of all degrees 
takes the form of exhibitionism, an impulse for showing off, even by 
crude display of himself, his body, , This tendency is very common, and 
leads to many results of a very undesirable social character Infantile 
men and w omen are primarily in love with themselves and care only how 
pretty they are They spend large portions of their income and life on 
dresses and grooming, which, of course, have no social value Such 
types live in an infantile world and are socially useless, often parasitic 
on the social body Often those who support them rum their lives to 
satisfy these infantile semantic characteristics 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


521 


Infantile exhibitionism leads, also, very often to a selection of a 
career Most diplomats, politicians, professional military men, preachers, 
actors, boxers, wrestlers, athletes, many lawjers and public speakers, 
to list only the more important professions, select their professions be- 
cause of this infantile tendency We should notice that in this list we 
find the most important professions whicli, as yet, have shaped our des- 
tinies Royalty, hereditary potentates, and many plutocrats Ine under 
such infantile fairy-tale conditions that they necessarily become seman- 
tically twisted 

This pathological tendency probably accounts for our so-called 
civilization being at an infantile asocial level, based, as it is, on selfish- 
ness, ‘sense’ gratification, might, brutal competition, acquisitiveness, 
We should notice that whole ‘philosophies', such as theism, the older 
ontology, teleology, materialism, solipsism, the Anglo-Saxon philosophy 
of selfishness, and different military and commercial philosophies, clearly 
display these infantile characteristics Commercialism, the ‘law of supply 
and demand’, as a by-product, also follows from infantile world- out- 
looks Those who are interested in problems of politics, economics, 
sociology, war, and peace , should investigate their pioblems from this 
semantic point of view As Eurrow well said, the problems of war are 
more the problems of psychiatry tlian of diplomacy 

Many women at present are still infantile, \ery little developed as 
human beings , they are themselves exhibitionists and also sponsor exhi- 
biUomsm It should not surprise us to find that these chai acteristics, the 
lavishing of ‘love’ on shiny buttons and on regiments marching to their 
destruction, have favoured wars During the Russian revolution of 1905, 
the czar’s soldiers weie on the streets But women did not ‘love’ them 
then Little children spat on them from behind corners The result was 
that very soon the soldiers refused to carry on this unapproved service 
I know many cases connected with the World War, where, in spite of 
unspeakable horrors, many regretted the ending of the war because of the 
infantile approval shown by their women for their ‘glory’ and the 
infantile thrill the soldiers themselves experienced because of the shiny 
buttons, martial music, and parades In the old system, militarism, re- 
ligionism, legalism, and commercialism are strictly interconnected by 
'similar sr Eliminate any one of them for good, and the others would 
become obsolete or would disintegrate Our infantile women, no doubt, 
have sponsored through the ages these infantile social cancers 

The future war will, perhaps, automatically bring these problems to 
the foreground It will be an extremely devastating (and less pictur- 
esque) aerial war, in which women and children will not be spared. 



522 VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 

' Then, perhaps, some of these infantile women will begin to face m a 
reality, and so will help to start a new era of human adulthood Men 

, will always depend in their standards on the ishes of women 

”” In infantile nations we witness, also, a great deal of exhibitionism, 
a craze for athletics, clothes, sumptuousness, noisy behaviour, parades, 
uniforms, ‘military academies’, military drills, ‘Serious’, yet infantile, 
‘business men’ love to parade on the streets dressed up like little boys or 
circus performers, give themsehes some ‘mysterious’ high-sounding and 
empty high titles, play with swords which they do not know how to 
handle , In international affairs, of course, a nation of a more pro- 
nounced infantile semantic tendency will seek to keep away from adult 
international associations The attitude of the United States towards 
the League of Nations and that of Great Britain towards the project 
of a confederated Europe suggest themselves at once m this connection 

Infantilism has another serious and detrimental connection with 
race problems , namely, through the sex glands or gonads m their effect 
upon ‘love’ and other activities We should realize and emphasize that 
the sex glands do not function only as ‘sex’ glands in the common mean- 
ing of the word, but even more as internal secretion glands with an enor- 
mous bearing on all life and ‘mental’ processes , a A, non-el orientation 
should never forget that 

The various consequences of castration are well known, and need 
not be repeated here But the interrelation of the gonads with the thymus 
and ivith thyroid glands is of interest to us The term gonad means 
reproductive gland, which produces the egg cells or the sperms The 
thymus is a term applied to a light pink gland situated in the superior 
and anterior part of the thorax It extends up into the roots of the neck 
and comes close to the thyroid gland The thjroid gland is a term 
applied to a deep red glandular mass consisting of two lobes which he, 
one on each side of the upper part of the trachea and lower part of the 
larjnx In women and children the thymus is relativel}' larger than in 
the adult male 

In humans the thymus grows up to the second year of life and 
then rapidly diminishes, so that only traces of it are found at puberty 
111 certain cases of arrested development or of general weakness in young 
people the thymus has been found to be persistent Castration at an early 
age leads to the persistence of the thymus gland Normally, the gland 
atrophies before the gonads come to maturity and begin to function In 
some of the lower mammals the gland does not disappear as early as it 
does m humans The thymus of the calf is popularly called the ‘chest 
sweetbread'.^' 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


523 


Atrophy of the thyroid m the adult is usually followed by blunting 
of ‘mental’ capacity Speech is slow, and cerebration delayed If the 
secretions are lacking m childhood we have what is known as ci etinism 
Excessive activity of the thyroid produces a condition known as exo- 
phthalmic goitre In many females at each menstruation the thyroid is 
perceptibly enlarged Extirpation of the thyroid before puberty brings 
about, among others, signs of cretinism, failure of development of the 
ovaries , so that puberty is delayed partially or completely 

Even these few particulars are sufficient to make us understand 
that when we begin to deal with ‘infantilism’, ‘arrested development’, or 
‘regression’, or ‘adulthood’, we deal with fundamental noii-cl semantic 
life-problems which are connected structurally wnth the organism-as-a- 
w'hole Bleuler describes disturbances of affectivity thus ‘The so-called 
psychopaths are really nearly all exclusnely or mainly thy mo paths Fur- 
thermore, since affectivity dominates all other functions, it assumes a 
prominent role m psychopathology generally, even in slight deviations, 
not only on account of its own morbid manifestations, but even more 
because in disturbances in any sphere, it is the affective mechanisms that 
first create the manifest symptoms What w^e call psychogenic is mostly 
thymogenic. The influence of the affects on the associations produces 
delusions, systematic splittings of personality, and hysteioid twulight 
states, repressed pain is the source of most neurotic symptoms, while 
displacements and irradiations produce compulsive ideas, obsessive acts, 
and similar mechanisms ’ 

The thymus appears not only as a childhood gland, but the adult 
gonads begin to function wdien the thjmus ceases to function When 
the thymus persists, we often find arrested development and psycho- 
pathological disturbances connected with infantilism It should be re- 
membered that in the organism not all ‘cause and effect’ sequences appear 
as one-to-one, but mostly as niany-to-one relations Therefore, no stan- 
dard mechanism can be readily assigned to a semantic disturbance But 
there are enough structural, functional, and colloidal mechanisms known 
to account for most disturbances, although the precise working is not 
known, 1933, m most cases 

Psychopathology and experience show that the ‘self-love’, ‘self- 
sufficiency’ , of infantilism are usually accompanied by marked sex dis- 
turbances, which, from a racial point of view, are just as important as 
the semantic disturbances 

Infantile types often have ‘charming’ qualities The women ‘are 
sweet’, ‘nice’, the men seem ‘good mixers’ and ‘popular’ The opposite 
sex often likes these characteristics In men a feeling of sympathy is

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


aroused for the ‘helpless little girl’, or else pedophihc tendencies are 
released (Pedophilia is used as the name of a ‘mental’ disturbariLe or 
desire for relations with children, often found among senile dementia 
and imbeciles ) In women, often a feeling of motherhood leads them 
to like infantile males The charm of the child lies, to a great extent, in 
his narcissism, his self-sufficiency, and inaccessibility Certain animals, 
such as cats and larger beasts of prey, fascinate us, as they do not con- 
cern themselves uith us and are inaccessible But this ‘charm’ has 
another and very tragic side Such infantile types cannot stand respon- 
sibilities , their affections are shallow and unreliable , they know how to 
take, but do not know how to give. In life, such connections lead 
invariably to great unhappiness, and often to disasters The children 
produced by such infantile types are usually completely ruined by the 
lack of parental understanding or lack of care Instead of liking such 
types, men and women of semantic maturity should either avoid them 
or suggest psychiatrical consultation 

Infantile types invariably show some sex disturbances, which also 
add greatly to family and social difficulties The men are often impotent , 
the women, frigid Onanistic and homosexual habits or tendencies per- 
sist, although such an adult infant is married and has an opportunity for 
normal life A very important A, non-el fact should be noticed Since 
the organism works as-a-whole, ‘mental’ components should be consid- 
ered in connection with sex life An infantile type appears still in an 
organ erotic stage He wants only sense gratification From a theory of 
sanity point of view, prostitution appears as a substitute for onanism 
In adult infants, we very often find either impotence, frigidity, onanism, 
homosexualism, as simple forms of arrested development or regression, 
or more extreme forms, like many cases of prostitution Infantiles not 
only indulge m promiscuity, but build up fanciful rationalizations and 
represent their own infantile tendencies by ‘theories’ as ‘normal’ con- 
duct Many criminals, professional ‘vamps’, and professed ‘heart- 
breakers’ belong to this type It is interesting to note that many ‘mental’ 
illnesses are connected with different onanistic rationalizations Often 
excessive cleanliness, continual washing of hands , appears If a schizo- 
phrenic onanist has a melancholic make-up, he rationalizes his problems 
that he is ‘rotting because of his sins’ If he has a manic make-up, he 
feels that he ‘is a saviour of mankind’ 

In all such cases family life is very unhappy, and the future of the 
children bred under such conditions is usually gloomy Children need 
healthy family and semantic conditions to develop into healthy indi- 
viduals 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


S2S 


The majority of professional criminals and prostitutes have an 
infantile make-up No matter how cunning, they usually show little 
foresight They appear egotistic, boastful, exhibitionistic , Gangsters 
love pomp , their funerals are, as a rule, very expensive, — they want, 
even after death, to ‘show off’ Criminals seldom become good fathers or 
mothers They treat each other brutally and are generally promiscuous 
Ethically, they behave usually as ‘moral imbeciles’, not realizing fully 
what they do I am not advocating the abolishment of the death penalty 
on sentimental grounds, but an enlightened society should abolish 
any penalty on sick individuals The ‘mentally’ ill criminal tjpe should 
be either taken care of or else eliminated with some scientific benefit, 
but not as a penalty. Professional criminals can hardly ever become 
‘morally reformed’ or useful members of society, unless the application 
of medical science can alter their pathological sr Without scientific 
attendance, they would practically always remain socially dangerous in- 
dividuals If we want to grow out of the present infantilism, experi- 
mentation on humans should be encouraged Modern experimentation 
on animals is very humane, and suffering is eliminated Criminals who 
are condemned to death should be given to science for experimenting 
They would not suffer Ultimately, they would probably die, but the 
benefits to the rest of mankind through scientific discoveries would be 
very important Under present conditions, we ‘take revenge on’, ‘pun- 
ish’ , mostly stek individuals, with seriously brutalizing semantic effects 
on the rest of us There is not the slightest doubt that experimentation 
confined solely to animals, no matter how useful, will not solve many 
problems of Smith Experimentation on humans is essential, and must 
be permitted Most of the notorious criminals who go to the gallows 
appear at least infantile. How instructive it would be to make experi- 
ments on such individuals in respect to their thymus , The list of 
experiments which science ought to make is very long, but material is 
lacking for such experimentation Let me repeat that modern science 
can conduct its experiments without suffering to the individual, in spite 
of the fact that some of these experiments would be dangerous and 
might easily end m the painless death of the subject The killing off of 
criminals (sick individuals) as a ‘revenge’ or ‘punishment’ or ‘justice’ 
is really too antiquated and too barbaric and wasteful for an enlightened 
society If society wants to eliminate them, society can do it, but, at 
least, let us do it without such brutalizing morbidity, and with as great 
benefit to knowledge as possible 

The elimination of infantilism must be considered more than a 
personal issue with individuals, it becomes an international semantic

problem, and such an international body as the League of Nations might 
originate a new era by starting a fundamental enquiry into this subject 

Infantilism m its national aspects is not equally distributed Some 
countries are more infantile than others In some countries even the 
university students show marked under-development for their age 
Burrow reports that a questionnaire among students of a prominent 
university in the United States of America shows a surprisingly large 
percentage of onanism and homosexualism 

We should notice that not even all scientists are free from infantil- 
ism. Many of them are childlike in that they do not really care for 
science, or civilization, or society, but are asocial and merely like to play 
%\ith their toys As an excuse (rationalization of tendencies and ‘emo- 
tions’), they usually profess ‘science for science’ sake’, not realizing 
that a complete adult must become a social teed individual and cannot 
keep aloof from general human interests, and that science represents a 
public, time-binding actiiity and concern, not the private pleasure or 
benefit of some one person. 

Section D Constructive suggestions 

As we have already seen, a young child cannot be ‘conscious of 
abstracting’, but he can acquire it gradually with experience. Racial, 
ordered experience is called science Every one of us has the tendencies, 
and, to some extent, the capacities, for developing science The mam aim 
of such racial, ordered experience is to save effort and unnecessary 
experiences, so that a child may start where the father leaves off (time- 
binding) The problems of consciousness of abstracting should be 
formulated by science and made available for semantic training This 
would fulfill the mam requirements of science, to save experience and 
effort, and to predict the future, to help m the mastery over external 
and internal ‘nature’, and so to produce semantic and physical adjustment 

If we teach and tram the children in the consciousness of abstract- 
ing, we save them an enormous amount of the effort which would he 
necessary to acquire it eventually by themselves, and we also eliminate 
a great deal of unnecessary sufferings and disappointments There is no 
danger of taking ‘the joy out of life’, the opposite is true With the 
consciousness of abstracting, the joy of living is considerably increased 
We have no more ‘frights’, bewilderments, or similar undesirable seman- 
tic experiences We grow up to full adulthood, and when the body is 
matured for the taking up of life and its responsibilities, we accomplish 
that, and find joy m it, as our ‘mind’ and ‘emotions’ have also matured 
Such a consciousness of abstracting leads to an integrated, semantically 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


527 


balanced and adapted adult personality Joys, pleasures, and ‘emotions’ 
are not abolished, as this cannot be done, given the structure of our 
nervous system and ‘mental’ health, but they are ‘sublimated’ to higher 
adult human semantic levels Life becomes fuller, and the individual 
ceases to act as a nuisance and a danger to himself and others 

In the racial aspects, if the development of the individual became 
normal, we should grow beyond infantile organ erotic fixations and el 
languages and infantile systems m all fields A /d-system, in accordance 
with science 1933 (E, N systems), would be the human link supplying 
scientific standards of evaluation to the affairs of Smith. 

With the older infantilism and the practically general lack of full 
consciousness of absti acting, the fears, frights, painful ‘emotional’ 
shocks under which mankind h\ ed were bound to have a marked, lasting, 
and sinister semantic and neurological effect upon the lace The race 
has never had an opportunity to develop in an adult way What will be 
the results for the race of such a transformation it is impossible, at 
present, to foresee , but one thing is certain, that the results are bound 
to be very far-reaching 

To afford a better appreciation of what the consciousness of ab- 
stracting can accomplish, two more points should be explained Most 
young fish do not know their parents, and, from the beginning, their 
life is independent of parental influences The human child is helpless, 
and, for a comparatively long period, is under parental influence His 
j r are consequently moulded, ‘mentally’, ‘emotionally’, by the doctrines, 
taboos, structure of language , of the parents. When we speak of a 
human child, we should never consider him in a fictitious isolation, which 
has nothing to do with in o reality Both parents and child should be 
made ‘conscious of abstracting’ Only under such semantic conditions 
can the full benefit be reached If parents are conscious of abstracting, 
and realize that their child represents, also, an abstracting in higher 
orders organism, which consciously or unconsciously registers in one form 
or another all happenings, the majority of the present unfortunate con- 
ditions, ‘complexes’ , could not possibly arise 

An important, yet usually disregarded, characteristic should be men- 
tioned here It is known that repeated ‘emotional shocks’ in childhood 
do harm As the experiments of Watson show, the child is usually born 
without ‘fears’ and without ‘frights’. Now ‘fears’ and ‘frights’ are not 
simply additive (a linear function) but follow some other more complex 
function of higher degree If we denote the constitutional potentialities 
of the child by /, and the given event by x, the result of the impact of 
X on the life of the child would be a reaction f(^x) =Fi. This Fi desig- 



528 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


nates what his make-up would make out of, or abstract from, x When 
another event y happens, the reaction of the child is no longer /(y), 
because this new event is usually taken by the child m the light of the 
former experience f{x) =Fi Thus, the effect on the child would be 
different, namely, Fi(y)=F2 If a new event z should happen, the 
child w ould react in his ‘feelings’ , as (z) = , . We see, then, that 

‘hurts’ and, in general, j r are iwt simply additive but may follow^ some 
other higher degree function This process appears general, perhaps 
necessary, and yet it involves many dangers which can be completely 
eliminated only by the acquired consciousness of abstracting. 

In practice, when we train a child in the consciousness of abstract- 
ing, we begin to check this devastating semantic process of piling up 
‘hurts’ oil ‘hurts’. Let us assume that before we begin to tram the child, 
the child has already had painful experiences His memories are still 
fresh, still fluid, he has little difficulty in dwelling on them With the 
consciousness of abstracting, and so proper evaluation, dawning upon 
him, further ‘hurts’ would ‘hurt’ less and less until the hurting process 
w'ould stop altogether In case some semantic harm had been done to the 
child before he became conscious of abstracting, the memories would be 
still fresh and he could apply his newly acquired semantic evaluational 
immunity to the harmful ‘hurts’ New ‘hurts’ in practice are usually 
related or similar to the old ones , they would ‘revive’ the older hurts 
Accordingly, he could not only ‘live through’ the older experiences but at 
once revise them, and after re-evaluation eliminate the harmful effects 

Semantic ‘emotional pains’ absorb nervous energy and prevent a 
full development of our capacities Directly the consciousness of ab- 
stracting IS acquired, the vast field of ‘miconsciousness’ is diminished, 
and the nervous energy which ^vas engaged in fighting semantic phan- 
toms IS released We should expect keener and sustained attention, 
strengthened interest, and other creative manifestations Consciousness 
of abstracting, as it leads to proper e\'aluation, not only eliminates many 
unnecessary sufferings and semantic disturbances, but, by doing so, 
actually releases stores of energy for useful and creative purposes 

The human brain has vast areas which, at present, have no definitely 
known functions Perhaps, with the older lack of consciousness of 
abstracting, the flow of nervous energy was misdirected or absorbed by 
the older w'ays of ‘feeling’ and ‘thinking’ in the lower centres Thus, the 
available energy left was not sufficient to utilize the higher centres to the 
full extent 

Personal semantic difficulties always seem very personal, and no 
outsider can ever fully grasp the situation One of the benefits of the 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY

present method of training in sanity consists in the fact that we do not 
dwell upon the personal affairs of the individual, but that we give, 
instead, a general structural semantic method, by the aid of which every 
one can solve his problems by himself 

We have established sharp differences between ‘man’ and ‘animal’. 
These differences must be considered of higher order, as the terms 
‘man’ and ‘animal’ are applied to abstractions of higher orders We 
found that ‘man’ through ignorance and inappropriate sr can copy 
animals m his nervous reactions Such copying appears either as ar- 
rested development or as regression In dealing with the terms ‘con- 
scious’ and ‘unconscious’, we discovered a general and human content 
for human ‘consciousness’, namely, the ‘consciousness of abstracting’ 
The ascribing of a general content abolishes a vast field of ‘unconscious- 
ness’, and so tends to prevent arrested development, infantilism, regres- 
sion , whenever this is possible. The problem of making the structure 
of langfuage similar at a given date to the structure of the events it 
symbolizes, is introduced The conquests of science become incorporated 
into daily life by the use of the new language The structure common 
to both science and language appears to be the intimate bond between 
science and hitman life The masses gain simple structural and semantic 
means for adjustment. 

A theory of sanity must draw attention to problems involving 
‘truth’, ‘falsehood’, ‘repressions’. Since the main usefulness of the 
theory is to help m attaining the most efficient working of the nervous 
system by the elimination of disturbing semantic factors, ‘attitudes’, 
doctrines , we must investigate the effect false (or repressed) state- 
ments may have on the working of the nervous system 

For instance, if we see that A, B, and C aie given m the order 
A,B,C, such lower abstractions start cycles of nervous currents, which 
correspond to the seen order If we see the order A,B,C, and say un- 
truthfully that the order appears as C,B,A, this statement results, also, 
from some cyclic nerve currents Obviously, we have some conilict and 
disturbance in the working of the system. If we make a mistake, the 
situation is diffeient Let us say that many observers definitely estab- 
lish the given order as A,B,C A new observer sees by mistake the order 
as C,B,A His nervous currents correspond to his error, and when he 
makes a truthful statement that he has seen C,B,A, this statement also is 
connected with the appropriate nerve currents and there is no conflict or 
disturbance between the corresponding nerve currents. The seen and 
reported correspond to each other.

VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


It IS easy to conclude that mistakes and deliberate falsehoods have 
a different mechanism A mistake, which leads to a subjectively true but 
objectively false statement, has no nervously disturbing factors Delib- 
erate false statements about facts involve semantic conflicts and disturb- 
ances m the functioning of the nervous system Similarly, with 
‘repressed’ material, permanently conflicting nervous currents are pres- 
ent The nervous energy is spent on conflicts and struggles, while all of 
it IS needed for constructive purposes. 

In scientific work we have similar problems We gather different 
abstractions of lower orders and then make higher abstractions about 
them When these two different orders of abstractions fit nicely struc- 
turally, we are satisfied and enjoy the resultant harmony If they conflict 
we feel restless Often scientists spend years, or even a lifetime, formu- 
lating higher order abstractions which do not conflict structurally with 
the lower abstractions Then they feel satisfied Scientists know well 
the feelings of ‘mental’ pain and discomfort Creative work is carried 
out because of such discomfort Those who are not creative do not 
experience this, but they also do not produce important work 

The problems of structure, of correct symbolism, of evaluation, of 
the production of higher order abstractions which are structurally simi- 
lar to the lower order abstractions , must have a neurological signifi- 
cance, and should be investigated from this point of view. Scientists 
should try to eliminate these unnecessary conflicts Those who feel no 
conflicts may, nevertheless, be so involved in it that they ha\e no free 
nervous energy left to overcome it Some such attempt is being made 
empirically in semantic therapy The psychiatrist tries to discover and 
eliminate the semantic conflict, thus freeing nervous energy which may 
then be spent on useful work 

In racial and national levels, sj stems of politics, economics , which 
are based on falsehoods and repression of truth, must unbalance the 
working of the nervous systems of the people Since they are the result 
of the infantile j r of the race, they propagate the arrested or regressive 
development in the part of the race whose s r they influence As usual, 
the VICIOUS circle is working here also A .^-system throws an entirely 
new light on the significance of science m human life Radios, with their 
attendant possibilities of hearing jazz or a delusional ‘revivalist’, and the 
invention of bigger and better means for killing people, do not repre- 
sent the mam pi actual importance of science Generalised science means 
scientific method and the discover)^ of the structure of events, to which 
the structure of our language must be adjusted if this daily tool of every- 
body IS not to play dangerous semantic tricks 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY

A ‘science of man’ must follow science (1933) m its structure 
and method Only by accepting the current ‘scientific metaphysics’ as 
given by science at a given date w samty possible The passing from an 
infantile ‘civilization’ to an adult civilization of fuller human life and 
happiness will come with the development of a scientific ciMlization 
which has scientific standards of evaluation But the passing will not 
be so easy As we have already seen, science contains affective factors, 
and many scientists still appear infantile In order to enter upon an 
adult civilization, we must first have non-infantile leaders, who must 
be produced by appropriate training This involves much research work 
along the lines sketched in the present work, and the establishment of 
chairs of general semantics and psychophysiology in universities Edu- 
cational methods must be radically revised, and experimentation encour- 
aged m the widest sense 

In 1933 we know positively that in the physico-chemical and col- 
loidal structures we find conditions of practically endless possibilities 
corresponding to the very large numbers of semantic states and re- 
actions Medical practice shows experimentally that a great many 
physical symptoms involving some colloidal states are produced by se- 
mantic disturbances , because, once these disturbances are eliminated, the 
physical symptoms vanish The enormous numbers of observed and pos- 
sible different s r could not be accounted for by the older, still prevailing, 
cl, A, and two-, or three-valued outlook, and the cumbersome, extremely 
limited, and necessarily slow chemical ‘passing of different substances’ 
through the nervous system 

It IS true that every student of medical science is acquainted with 
colloidal behaviour, but this knowledge has been neither emphasized nor 
consistently applied, because colloidal behaviour represents physico- 
chemical processes involving electromagnetic, high pressure , manifesta- 
tions which cannot be dealt with at all by el, A means Thus, a physician 
who IS not trained m A general semantics, cannot ‘think’ in colloidal and 
physico-chemical terms, which in 1933 are the only modern ways of 
dealing with the organism-as-a-whole This is much more serious than 
the layman or even the physicians realize, and accounts for the fact that, 
in spite of different special achievements and different discoveries, the 
practice of medicine is becoming more and more unsatisfactory It also 
explains why the average physician cannot grasp the importance of 
psychiatry for general medicine, and why some psychiatrists indulge m 
very unscientific and doubtful metaphysics Thus, a general physician 
u ho ‘thinks’ uniquely m seriously^ antiquated chemical and physiological 
terms, deals with a non-existent, fictitiously isolated A and el ‘body’. 



532 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


and cannot grasp the necessity for a non-el, A, and a physico-chemical, 
colloidal outlook, which integrates ‘body’ and ‘mind’ The majoritj of 
psychiatrists in their turn, and for similar reasons, often have a highly 
metaphysical outlook, repulsive to the general physician They do not 
seem to realize that they have at their disposal colloidal and physiological 
mechanisms as well as physico-mathematical formulations based on four- 
dimensional order, and that they, therefore, do not need any doubtful 
metaphysics With A modern semantics, the only possible scientific out- 
look (1933) must be colloidal, physico-chemical and physico-mathemati- 
cal, in which the long sought for non-el solution of the ‘body-mmd’ is 
found The difficulties I am dealing with are general and depend on 
fundamental principles, the disregard of which introduces semantic 
blocking factors, at present imposed on the medical students, and from 
which only a few exceptional, scientifically inclined individuals are 
capable of breaking away From the present point of view the older 
reflexology is also unsatisfactory and requires a A reformulation 

The present system, although far from complete, already suggests 
many most important structural issues which should be verified empir- 
ically Experiments alone can decide which verbal structures are similar 
to empirical structures, and experimentation should be encouraged in the 
widest sense Some further theoretical work should also be done Clini- 
cal literature describes many new and unexpected facts These facts 
should be described anew in the new language, to see what relations sur- 
vive the transformation of forms of representation Thus, if it is found 
that all ‘mental’ ills in all different formulations indicate improper evalu- 
ation, we should be justified in concluding that evaluation represents an 
invariant general characteristic of the activities of the human organism- 
as-a-ivhole, and, consequently, must be of extraordinary importance for 
adjustment and sanity When we reach this conclusion, we should in- 
vestigate the mechanism of evaluation, starting wuth the simplest issues ; 
namel}, investigating those factors which make proper evaluation im- 
possible We should discover that identification in all cases makes proper 
evaluation impossible, and should then conclude that identification must 
be entirely eliminated before we can go one step further In fact, once 
we have reached these rather obvious results, the rest of the ^-system 
follow's But this w'ould not be enough , we must verify the conclusions 
empirically, and this suggests directly that a definite series of experi- 
ments should be undertaken 

In hospitals for ‘mentally’ ill two equally large groups of accessible 
patients exhibiting similar clinical symptoms should be selected, and 
isolated A physician who himself has undergone a A training should 



UX-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


533 


attempt to re-train the i r of one group The other group should not be 
re-trained, but treated in the average passive and standard way, — it 
would be the control group One physician should be in charge of both 
wards and keep a detailed record of the cases and treatment It is to be ex- 
pected that at the end of the year, m the w ard trained in the A standards 
of evaluation, a larger number of unexpected and spontaneous recoveries 
would happen than in the untrained ward It would be extremely in- 
structs e to have more than two groups, and to attempt a different 
group method, folloiving some other medical school based on another 
s\ stem-function The passive attitude toward the patients should be 
changed, as under the older methods physicians in ‘mental’ hospitals are 
more glorified keepers than medical men This is what theory suggests. 
Experiments alone can show if these conclusions are correct In special 
individual cases, the theory has already been confirmed, but it should be 
tried as a group method, and, if successful, only then w'ould ‘mental’ 
hospitals become hospitals, and not mere places of detention 

A few w'ords concerning psychotherapy w'lll not be amiss In a 
time-binding class of life, we must take into account the historical four- 
dimensional experiences of the race, which, even in individual cases, 
have sound neurological foundations, as it is known that the nervous 
reactions are influenced by past experiences History teaches us that 
the work of some men has influenced great masses of mankind for 
many’ years, and that the works of others have had liut little general, 
lasting effect The considerations of doctrinal functions and system- 
functions explain this fact quite simply The older an individual or a 
race grow’S, the more structural observations they gather, and the more 
they notice the structural dissimilarity of their forms of representation 
with the first order facts they encounter As adjustment is generally 
useful, individuals, as well as groups, and particularly scientists, ahvays 
attempt to disco'v er more structural data about the world and themselves 
This process requires, among others, the comparison of the structure 
of the forms of representation with the structure of the world and our- 
selves All so-called ‘progress’, ‘civilization’, and science depend on this 
In this particular field, achievements are of two kinds 
1) Some individuals produce a new system-function, wuth a new 
structure, more similar to the world , (see Chapter XI) In the great 
majority’ of cases, the new system-function is not formulated explicitly, 
but IS hidden implicitly behind some explicit particular and individual 
interpretation or particular system of the discoverer The production of 
a new system-function is usually a most important event and is indepen- 
dent of the special value given to the variables in this function by the 



534 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


originator. In such cases, the given originator has many followers, and 
there is a possibility of many doctrines or systems which have one doc- 
trinal function or system-function The content of the doctrines may 
be changed, but they all have one structure The importance of the neu 
doctrine or system was not in its particular interpretation, or in the 
assigning of a particular value to the variables, but in the underlying 
doctrinal function or system- function, which alone has explicit structure, 
and IS given by the postulates which establish the function 

2) Some individuals do not produce explicitly or imphatly new 
doctrinal function or system-functions, with new structure, but simph 
assign a new and individual value to the variables in the one doctrinal 
function or system-function produced by others These workers very 
often bitterly defend the prnate indmdual value they have assigned to 
a variable, and are often entirely innocent of the serious debt the) owe 
to the originator of the new' function which they utilize But these 
w'orks never mark a milestone in the progress of mankind and are 
usually soon forgotten 

Because of the disregard of the considerations explained here, the 
proper evaluation of different doctrines and sj stems is very difficult, 
and even in scientific circles the lack of orientation in this field is aston- 
ishing It seems that it is not enough to produce a ‘new theory’ to have 
made an important contribution to knowledge , but it is essential to pro- 
duce a new doctrinal function or system-function, because this only has 
a structural significance This point of view, perhaps, solves the tremen- 
dous and, as yet, unsolved difficulties we have in reducing doctrines to 
sets of postulates, which is admittedly desirable, and yet so hard to pro- 
duce Thus, to find the doctrinal function or system-function which 
undeilies a theory, ive must strip it of all accidental values privately 
ascribed to the variables, and formulate only the invariant relations zuliich 
are posited between the variables The finding of this function is also 
equn alent to finding the structure of a given theory 

We may consider that the psychoanalytical and psychotherapeutic 
movement originated with the work of Freud The epoch-making value 
of his w'ork consists in the fact that, underlying his special theory, there 
can be discovered a new system-function All other schools simply 
ascribe a different value to the variables, but do not produce, structural!) , 
new system-functions , they represent different systems which have one 
freudian system-function 

It IS here impossible to analyse this problem systematically or in 
detail, but a few structural hints may be useful 



UN-SANITY VERSUS SANITY 


535 


First, we must discriminate permanently between the freudian par- 
ticular system, which represents a particulai interpretation of the 
freudian system-function without specific interpretations say ‘complex 
x’, on semantic levels, which corresponds, let us say, to ‘cluster X’ on 
colloidal levels Second, we must realize that the freudian system-func- 
tion (not system) was scientific at the date of its production, but to be 
scientific 1933 it must be revised and reformulated, taking into considera- 
tion the newer physico-mathcmatical, physico-chemical, colloidal, A , 
points of view The struggle for a special ‘complex A’ or invention of 
a new ‘complex B' is useless because in 1933 the colloidal, structural 
‘cluster X' which underlies the semantic ‘complex x’, which alone can 
legitimately be considered in a system-function, includes all of the ‘com- 
plexes’ in literary existence, and there are no assignable limits to their 
numbers If we analyse iii such oo-valued terms as, for instance, ‘clus- 
ter X’, we evade an enormous amount of unnecessary and confusing 
metaphysics, and become scientific in the 1933 sense From a modern, 
A system-function point of view, which means, when we recognize the 
necessity of oo-valued semantics, stiucture , necessitating the reduction 
of a system to a postulate base, ue readily see that the freudian system- 
function (not system) is a necessary and natural passing step between 
the A and A systems 

The postulates which are discovered m the freudian system-function 
can be divided into two main groups 

1) The observations of human behaviour and, m my language, of 
sr, have to be formulated in a special language to fit the more struc- 
turally fundamental parts of the system 

2) The fundamental and i evolutionary new postulates were, at the 
date of their introduction, quite scientific In 1933 these postulates have 
to be reformulated and made to comply to modern physico-niathemati- 
cal, physico-chemical, and general semantic A standards 

A satisfactory analysis of the above problems would require a spe- 
cial volume, therefore, I shall entirely disregard No 1, and from No 2 
shall only suggest a few most important and new postulates These can 
, be expressed, roughly, as follows (a) The postulation of an active 
' ‘dynamic’ unconscious This postulate departs widely from the older 
notions, although the word ‘dynamic’ is used m this connection m the 
vernacular, but not strictly scientific, sense The methods of translating 
the dynamic into static and Mce versa, are disregarded, oiviiig to the 
innocence of modern science and the assumption by physicians, m gen- 
eral, of the permanent validity of A principles (b) Once the active 
unconscious is postulated, some determinism follows according to the 



536 


VII. THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


date Freud, at his date, accepted the (in 1933 antiquated) two-valued 
determinism Unfortunately, the great majority of physicians and the 
medical education still follow the antiquated notions (c) As the past is 
taken into account and man is treated as a process in which the past 
experiences play an important role, we might say that the outlook is 
four-dimensional, but this statement is not entirely justified, because the 
notion of a consistent four-dimensional orientation carries us much 
further than physicians, who neglect phj sico-mathematical aspects, can 
possibly produce 

In a /^-system, the fundamental postulates of the system-function 
V, hich underlies all psychotherapy have been accepted, although they have 
been vastly enlarged to comply with the known facts and scientific 
requirements of 1933 It is important to investigate independently, sys- 
tematically, and in detail, the corresponding system-functions and to 
find to what extent they mutually intertranslate, but such an investigation 
cannot be carried out successfully if we confuse, through the habits of 
speech, the two different terminologies 

It seems that the older psychotherapeutic schools have been formu- 
lated as systems, and that the system-function, which underlies them, 
has not been explicitly stated, greatly hampering future creative work 

The special benefit of a generalized theory is in its fundamental 
simplicity and entirely general linguistic applicability, which, for pre- 
vention, plays a decisive role Accidentally, we acquire psychophysio- 
logical means to influence the so difficult ‘narcissistic’ cases 

The present author has attempted to indicate the most important 
structural and semantic factors which would facilitate the future workers 
in the impending, necessary revision and co-ordination.

The present remarks were originally written for the last chapter of 
the whole volume, but a final critical survey of the material suggested 
the newly ordered sequence of the present three mam divisions Book I 
gives a general preparatory introduction w'hich will help the reader to 
differentiate between the A and A systems, and to evaluate properly the 
differences Book 11 formulates the main A principles which constitute 
an organic interrelated w'hole, to which the present concluding lemarks 
belong Book III gives some additional structural data about mathe- 
matics and physics which usually are not treated from the present point 
of view, but which furnish the essential structural material needed 

The writing of Book I, and particularly Book III, was very 
laborious and difficult I often had the temptation to omit Book III 
entirely, and to refer the reader to other authors After months of 
search, however, I found, to my sorrow, that, in spite of many excellent 
volumes, there were no books written from a structural and semantic

point of view To refer the reader to other writers would necessitate 
the reading of a fair-sized library, because often from a whole book he 
would need only a few scattered paragraphs This would imohe a very 
expensive and laborious process of hunting, i\hich very few would 
undertake , besides, it would not give a connected structural or semantic 
picture I tried to induce some specialists to write a book on the struc- 
ture and semantic aspects of mathematics, and another similar book on 
physics I was told that it would be very laborious and difficult, if at 
all possible, and so I had no other choice than to try to write it myself 

I earnestly suggest the reading of Book III, so that the reader may, 
at least, become acquainted with the existence of such problems I hope 
that e\en specialists may find some suggestions helpful, because the 
structural and semantic aspects of science and mathematics are usually 
neglected, the neglect of which introduces needless difficulties in the 
teaching The elimination of identification helps to solve many scientific 
puzzles, besides eliminating semantic blockages and so helping creative 
activities 

The world affairs have seemingly come to an impasse and probably, 
without the help of scientists, mathematicians, and psychiatrists included, 
we shall not be able to solve our urgent problems soon enough to pre\ ent 
a complete collapse Now those who are professionally engaged m 
human affairs, economists, sociologists, politicians, bankers, priests of 
every kind, teachers , ‘mental’ hygiene workers, and psychiatrists in- 
cluded. do not even suspect that material and methods of great geneial 
semantic value can be found in mathematics and the exact sciences The 
drawing of their attention to this fact, no matter how' clumsily done at 
first, will stimulate further researches, produce better formulations and 
understanding, and ultimately create conditions where sanity will be 
possible 

Some of those who have seen my manuscript or with whom I have 
discussed the problems seemed to dislike the term ‘copying animals in 
our nervous reactions’ and also the explicit introduction of ‘Fido’ As 
identification is found among animals, primitives, infants, and ‘mentally’ 
ill, it could be said that the introduction of ‘Fido’ was not necessary I 
ha\ e gi\ en serious consideration to the eventual desirability of completely 
eliminating ‘Fido’ from my wmrk and substituting the term ‘primitive’ , 
but, after mature deliberation, I decided that it wall be helpful to accentu- 
ate the distinction between the reactions of animal and man The mam 
justifications of this are as follows* 

1) My whole work and the formulation of a ..d-system started 
with an attempt to produce a science of man, this necessitating a mod-

539 


ern, scientific functional, non-elementalistic, sharp definition of man. 
Such a definition was gnen in my Manhood of Humanity to the effect 
that man differs from the animals m the capacity of each human gen- 
eration to begin where the former generation left off This capacity I 
called the time-bmdmg function This definition cannot be denied, and 
it fulfills the modern requirements 

2) The present enquiry originated in the investigation of the 
mechanism of timc-bmding, and is a further anal} sis of the sharp dif- 
ferences between the reactions of animals and humans, which became the 
psychophysiological foundation of a /?-S3'stein and a theory of sanity 

3) The further the investigation advanced, it became increasingly 
evident that the issues involved are extremely complex, and that m this 
field, from a structural and non-el point of view, practically nothing has 
been done In general, all existing ‘logics’ and ‘psychologies’ are stiuc- 
turally misleading, since they are still thoroughly el and pre-A or A , 
these conditions necessitate the elimination of them, as well as othei 
dependent disciplines, to prevent their being accepted as structurally 
fundamental It was then desirable, in my pioneering enterprise, to keep 
a simpler and more obvious contrast between ‘Fido’, whom we nearly all 
know quite well and usually like, and ‘Smith’, whom no one seems to 
know properly This method has proved very useful to the writer and 
I am convinced that many readers will find it equally helpful I frankly 
admit that if I had not followed this simplified method, I could not have 
produced the /4-system and discovered in this psycho-logical maze the 
blockages introduced into our j r by identification, elementalism, lack of 
consciousness of abstracting, improper evaluation , and, m general, 
infantilism 

For these three mam reasons it seemed advisable to retain ‘Fido’ 
as a most useful factor in my anal} sis, with all due apologies to ‘Fido’ 

I also admit that I did not realize the difficulties of the task and 
the magnitude of the undertaking The last revision alone of the manu- 
script required more than a year I am all too well aware to what extent 
the presentation falls short of my expectations and how much better it 
could have been written by some one more gifted, but the following 
lather unexpected developments sustained my courage 

1) Curiously enough, the principles involved are often childishly 
simple, often ‘generally known’, to the point that on several occasions 
some older scientists felt ‘oflended’ that such ‘obvious’ principles should 
be so emphasized Yet my experience, without any exception, was that 
no matter how much these simple principles were approved of verbally, 
in no case were they fully applied tn practice Slowly I understood that 



540 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


we cannot tram mankind m identification by all available means, which 
must prevent adjustment, and then live by non-identification Thus, 
when non-identity is pointed out, even a moron will ‘agree’, or wonder 
at the silliness of an author who fusses about it, yet, because all of us 
were trained m a linguistic and semantic system based on identity, that 
infantile identification will unconsciously play havoc with all our s r the 
rest of our lives, unless this semantic blockage is counteracted Natur- 
ally, the ‘simpler’ a principle appears, to which we may pay hp service, 
but which we never fidly apply, the more I became convinced that the 
discovery of new methods for the application of this simple yet neglected 
principle must be considered most important. Any reader may verify 
by himself to what extent identifitatjon introduces difficulties in his own 
life In fact, the main difficulties we have can always be traced to some 
identification somewhere 

2) The experimental data of Doctor Philip S Graven with the 
‘mentally’ ill and those cases of semantic disturbances which, in the 
orthodox way, were not supposed to be un-sane, showed that a change 
from the A standards of evaluations involving identification to the A 
standards without identification often either brought about a complete 
semantic reconstruction of an individual, or semantic, expedient, and 
lasting ‘cures’ This fact again impressed me with the genuine work- 
ability and so human importance of a .^d-system If the old ‘impossible 
to change’, ‘human nature’ can be ‘changed’ by tlie new simple psjeho- 
physiological methods, this again suggests that this new system, no mat- 
ter how imperfect, may be useful 

3) I was also very much impressed by the far-reaching power of 
the A methods As a rule, only mathematicians and epistemologists fully 
appreciate what the power of a method means Thus, the differential 
methods were invented, and later we found that these methods were 
structurally applicable to all processes A tensor calculus was invented, 
and we found that it gave us absolute, invariant formulations applicable 
to all physics Many other methodological innovations could be cited, 
and aluays the generality of the applications gave the value to those 
new formulations The present .,4-systein was formulated in a way inde- 
pendent of other diciphnes, as it was the direct result of structural 
semantic researches free from idenhficalion This led to the formulation 
of fundamental general principles whicli underlie all human ‘knowledge’, 
such as non-identity, requiring the recognition of structure as the only 
possible content of ‘knowledge’ and so leading to the formulation of 
‘similarity of structure’, non-elementalism as a general principle, the 
general principle of uncertainty, oo-valued general semantics,. It is 



CONCLUDING REMARKS 


541 


naturally very reassuring to find that the newest most important achieve- 
ments of science have followed these principles unconsciously and have 
applied them before they were explicitly formulated 

From another point of view, a ^4 -system which could claim to be 
‘modern’, should formulate general principles that all scientists in every 
field could follow. This was practically the case with the -system until 
Francis Bacon It is also the case with the present system except that 
different scientists have applied these new principles without having 
produced a general formulation The fact that these principles had no 
general formulation was a retarding factor e\en in science and made 
the application of science to human affairs impossible In the following 
examples, the different A aspects overlap, and I am emphasizing only 
the most marked features Thus Einstein-Minkowski’s space-time, 
Emstem-Mayer’s new unified field theory, the newer quantum mechan- 
ics, the new physics of high pressure, piezochemistry , the tropism 
theory of the late Jacques Loeb, the physiological giadieius of C. il 
Child . , . , exhibit clearly the application of non-elementalism Heisen- 
berg’s restricted principle of uncertainty is also the result of the appli- 
cation of non-elementalism, based on the observation that the ‘observer’ 
and the ‘observed’ cannot be sharply divided This principle becomes a 
particular instance of the general A principle of uncertailffy, which 
again is based on the observation that we deal actually with\absolute 
individuals and speak in more or less general terms, with the res\ilt tljal 
all statements are only probable m different degrees. J 

The absolute individuality of four-dimensional events, objects, sjA 
ations, sr , necessitates an indefinitely flexible evaluation requnW 
co-valued A semantics Outside of daily life, the best examples an 
given m science by the newer developments m vitamins, the effect.® of 
radiant energy on heredity, but particularly by the bewildering pos ibil- 
ities disclosed by the developments of physics, physics of high preinire, 
piezochemistry, polymorphism, colloidal behaMour, and the appbcjt'on 
of colloidal knowledge to psychiatry The Polish school of muliema- 
ticians has produced the extension of the traditional two-’ 'ued A 
‘logic’ to three-, and many- valued ‘logic’ , Chw istek has ba' < d a new 
foundation of mathematics and a new theory of aggregriLS on his 
semantic methods , but even these writers disregarded the Oi nn al prob- 
lems of non-elementalism, non-identity, and the necessit for a full- 
fledged /4-system before their formulations can beco'nc free from 
paradoxes, valid, and applied to life 

All these issues combined are of particular interc l tc' i’'ankind in

if mankind is to pass from an infantile stage of its development into an 
era of general sanity, this would require a serious collaboration of medi- 
cal science Unfortunately, medical science is one of the most laborious 
and difficult disciplines, and, of late, in spite of some specific advances, 
it IS rapidly ceasing to be m general a modern science Any one who 
attends medical congresses, scientific meetings, or follows up medical 
literature often wonders whether he listens to, or reads, scientific argu- 
ments, or sixteenth century religious disputes Dr F G Crookshank, 
m his chapter on The Importance of a Theory of Signs and a Critique 
of Language in the Study of Medicine m Ogden and Richard’s The 
Meaning of Meaning, 'gives an excellent picture of the present sad state 
of affairs , but a A analysis discovers deeper foundations underlying the 
difficulties m medicine, which would have to be remedied by the revision 
of medical education. In this connection, A issues become very impor- 
tant Organisms in general, and humans m particular, represent col- 
loidal processes which involve tremendous pressure because of colloidal 
attraction for water Dr Neda Marinesco^ has recently suggested that 
Ice VI constitiites an important factor in the human organism Ice VI 
repiesents a new form of ice discovered by P W Bridgman® who found 
that water in bulk and at the temperature of the body may be found to 
crystallize by the application of high pressure It is the notion of Dr 
Marmesco that the forces of adsorption may be as high as the pressure 
to cd by Bridgman, so that in thin surface films the arrangement of water 
'hytecules may be much like that found in Ice VI It may interest the 
rr tder to know that, among others. Professor Bridgman discovered that 
ajeton becomes solidified at room temperature, albumen coagulates , 
jpnder high pressure 

Although physicians in their university days are well acquainted 
w'lth colloidal chemistry, yet somehow, m practice, they have great 
difficulties m ‘thinking’ in colloidal terms With the newest discoveries 
of physics of Ivgh pressure and piezochemistry, with their bewildering 
variety of physical manifestations, which, under different pressure, 
change with every individual material, a modern physician will have to 
‘think’ not only in terms of colloids, but of colloids m combination with 
the data of high-pressure physics and piezochemistry Now such ‘think- 
ing’ IS humanly impossible under the traditional two-, or three-valued A 
disciplines and becomes only possible with co-valued A general seman- 
tics One of the immediate results of the use of A disciplines is the 
elimination of the elementalism of ‘body’ and ‘mind’, ‘intellect’ and ‘emo- 
tions’. , and the introduction of the non-el point of view as given in the 
present work This requires every physician to be acquainted with

psychiatry, which acquaintance would eliminate many harmful cults It 
should be fully realized that the older chemistry which dealt with differ- 
ent ‘substances’, having different ‘properties’, could haie been treated 
by A subject-predicate and two-, or three- valued means But not so in 
1933 , the older chemistry is gone, and today we deal only with a special 
branch of physics based on structure , the newer physics of high pressure 
show cleaily that many of the older characteristics of 'substances’ are 
only accidental functions of pressure, temperature, and what not, uhich 
vary m a bewildering way, requiring new semantic principles, new 
epistemologies , m short, a new non-el and oo-valued ^-system In 
other words, whoever retains the A sris entirely unable to ‘think’ scien- 
tifically 111 the modern sense If we want to have a science of man or a 
1933 science of medicine , the first step is to revise thoroughly the 
A-system 

In fact, many more interconnections and interrelations could be 
shown which would make still more obvious how a ^-system results 
from, and leads to, modern scientific results, which can be extended and 
applied to all human concerns only after a general formulation as a 
system 

4) If the difference between the animal and man consists in the 
capacity of the latter to start where the former generation left off, obvi- 
ously humans, to be humans, should exercise this capacity to the fullest 
extent If we fail to do this, we again ‘copy animals m our nervous 
reactions’, which copying is the very tiling we should struggle against 
This ‘where the former generation left off’ would not onh include all 
science, but also epistemology and the ‘wisdom’ which through painful 
experiences each former generation has accumulated , which, in prin- 
ciple, should he given to eveiy child Under the A conditions of our 
present education , systems, and evaluational systems, this is compk I "h, 
impossible and may sound visionary Thus, to acquire scientific knowl- 
edge in all fields, one would have to spend a lifetime devjed to science, 
entirely free from financial worries , and even then he would only be 
able to acquire a small part of it Before any older epistemological m - 
sight could be imparted, one should not only have special gifts, mter- 
cests , but should also have an enormous amount of knowledge before 
such an education could be attempted Similarly with ‘wisdom’ The 
older and the younger generations, by colloidal necessity, cannot fully 
understand each other and, to a large extent, have mutual mistrust, 

I which, as yet, is an entirely normal A sr. 

In a non-el, ^-system this whole situation becomes radically"^ 
^changed The impossible is made possible , I may say more, it is made

simple and easy, and becomes a necessary and unavoidable factor in the 
life of any child A non-el, ,4-S3stem is based on the complete elimination 
of identification, from which it directly follows that the only link between 
the un-speakable objective levels and the verbal lei els is found in struc- 
ture Structure, then, becomes the only possible content of all knowl- 
edge , and all scientific technicalities, admittedly laborious and difficult, 
become only a necessary tool in the search foi structure, with little, if 
any, intrinsic value, and are unnecessary for ‘knowledge’ as soon as in 
a given case the structure is discovered. This structure is ahvays simple 
and can be given to children 

It IS meaningless and utterly useless to argue whether or not the 
world IS ‘simple’, as the world is not our understanding of it, but as 
our ‘understanding’ happens to be structural, our nervous system, 
through its abstracting capacities, makes it simple, once its structural 
content is discovered As the search for structure involves similarity of 
linguistic and empirical structures, we readily understand that any lan- 
guage, which w e cannot evade teaching our children, has structure and 
involves structural assumptions In the structural revision of our lan- 
guage and the teaching of a few structurally appropriate terms, entirely 
abandoning a few structurally misleading ones, we directly impart all 
up-to-a-date fundamental knowlege to any child We tram him auto- 
matically in the appropriate linguistic structure, which builds up in him 
appropriate j r Mankind at large does not need scientific technicalities 
to absorb and thereby obtain semantic benefits from the structural results 
of science These results are the only ones which really matter, and 
which can he given in an extremely simple way, automatically abolishing 
' the primitive metaph} sics, structural assumptions, and infantile j r 
, By abolishing the structurally false to facts one-valued identification, 
\Ve automatically train in oo-valued differentiation leading toward con- 
sc\^ousness of abstracting, wdiich results in all the wisdom that epistem- 
ol'jgj' and prii*te experience can give us, being structurally a total result 
of racial experience As structure is based on relations and order, 
structural training, when done consciously, becomes a ph>siological 
^hiethod, working simply and automatically 

In the .,4-system these semantic mechanisms were not consciously 
recognized, although they worked fatalistically with us We w'ere impart- 
ing primitive psychophysiological reactions to our children, who had to 
spend a lifetime to learn by very painful experience that something w'as 
w rong somewhere Now we understand that the origin of the difficultv 
was in the lack of scientific investigations which would have anal)'sed, 
non-elementalistically, the structural aspects of language and connected 



CONCLUDING REMARKS 


545 


j r All of which, let me repeat, works automatically, as experience and 
experiments abundantly show Thus, an analysis of the mechanism of 
time-binding depends on the discovery of a sharp non-el difference be- 
tween ‘Fido’ and ‘Smith’, and the formulation of means to make the 
time-binding characteristics of man fully effective with all except heavily 
pathological individuals 

By abolishing identification we generalize differentiation and so 
impart consciousness of abstracting, an indispensable factor in proper 
evaluation, and an absolute condition for adaptive and so survival be- 
haviour Thus a -system becomes a general theory of sanity and the 
general theory of time-binding, from which general semantics follow 

5) One of the most important features of the present ,^?-system 
consists of Its iion-cl structural character We may analyse problems in 
a scientific ‘intellectual’ way , yet this analysis, because non-el, structural, 
and semantic, appeals to, and affects, our ‘feelings’, ‘intuitions’ , involving 
psychophysiological factors based on order Thus, the structurally neces- 
sary translations of one level of abstractions into the others and vice 
versa, is enormously facilitated, while in el systems these translations 
were hampered by unavoidable semantic blockages Accordingly, ‘intel- 
lect’, ‘emotions', ‘body’, and ‘mind’ , are not divided The organism is 
affected as-a-whole, because structurally correct non-el means are em- 
ployed, making many benefits of the system accessible to children, 
morons, and, perhaps, even superior idiots. The last results aie to be 
foreseen, although they have not, as yet, been verified empirically. 

6) But the most workable feature of the system consists in the fact 
that, being based on such fundamental principles as non-identification 
non-elementalism , it has an organic unity The mam issues are all 
strictly interrelated and apply to ‘body’, ‘mind’, ‘emotions’ , in a non-el 
way, all working automatically, no matter from what angle we approach 
the training 

Thus, if we start with order, we are led to lelations and structure, 
these establish differentiation and stratification, eliminating identification 
and ‘allness’, which result in consciousness of abstracting, necessitating 
Gc-valued general semantics, indispensable to proper evaluation and ad- 
justment If we start with non-identity, v\e are led to order, relations, 
structure, differentiation, stratification, non-allness, consciousness of 
abstracting, oo-valued semantics, proper evaluation, and adjustment If 
we start with differentiation or stratification, we are led to order, rela- 
tions, sti iicture, non-identification, non-allness, consciousness of abstract- 
ing, and proper evaluation 



546 


VII THE MECHANISM OF TIME-BINDING 


It should be noticed that consciousness of abstracting and proper 
evaluation are complex end-results which cannot be imparted directly, 
but which become automatically lasting semantic states only after we 
have eliminated one-valued identification, or introduced order, ao-valued 
differentiation, stratification , The non-el benefit of the system consists 
in engaging the organism-as-a-whole Thus, four-dimensional order 
plays the role of a potent physiological factor in the process and becomes 
the foundation for psychophysiology Non-identity is a term applied on 
the verbal levels, which, on visual and intuitive levels, involves differen- 
tiation, ordering, and stratification This system thus involves all neces- 
sary nerve centres and operates in a non-el way, as reactions on one level 
are easily and organically translated into the terms of other levels, 
making psychophj siology possible 

7) Finally, it is significant that many publications in the last ten 
jears have shown efforts in a similar direction, w'hich have recened 
scientific and public approval As I am more interested in creative work, 
rather than critical, I shall not analyse these strivings except to make 
one general remark that, because they are not based on order, structure, 
non-cl s r, the complete elimination of identification , they are \ aluable 
and useful to the selected few, but under no conditions could a psycho- 
physiology or a theory of sanity be based on these works which could 
be applicable in general elementary linguistic and semantic education 
If I am not mistaken, in this respect the present work differs radically 
from the others with which I am acquainted 

From a non-el point of view w'e can never disregard the effect the 
‘body’ or ‘emotions’ have on the ‘mind’, and vice I'ersa the effect that the 
‘mind’ has on the ‘emotions’ and the ‘body’. Identification and all its 
consequences involve seriously disturbing semantic factors with corre- 
sponding colloidal disturbances, and it seems that, as yet, the human 
race, outside of very exceptional cases, has never been free from these 
disturbances What effect the elimination of such disturbances will ha\e 
on the human race it is impossible to foretell at this stage, beyond ex- 
pressing the expectation that the consequences must be highly beneficial 
We have already become acquainted with the terms ‘conditional’ and 
‘unconditional’ reactions In the example of the patient and the paper 
roses, w'e have seen that the pathological symptoms were ‘unconditional’ 
They were compulsory, as in the case of the dogs mentioned in Part VI 
In a healthy individual they would hare been fully conditional reactions, 
under semantic control The above terminology may be extended so as 
to apply to all ‘mental’ ills, for here that which in the ‘normal’ person 
IS a fully conditional reaction becomes unconditional, or a reaction of 



CONCLUDING REMARKS 


547 


loiver order conditionality (compulsory) beyond conscious control Here 
we differ from animals and hospital cases When our conditional reac- 
tions are not fully regulated by proper s r and become unconditional, we 
copy animals, and so are in a state of arrested development or of 
regression. 

The general therapeutic and preventive measures are clearlj indi- 
cated by such considerations Conditional reactions m man should be- 
come fully conditional and not fixed as unconditional, or conditional of 
lower orders In other words, instead of ‘fixation’, we should have 
means and methods to preserve and foster semantic Hexibility This last 
IS accomplished by acquiring the semantic reactions connected with the 
consciousness of abstracting I recommend this last point to the atten- 
tion of specialists, as it is impossible in the present work to go further 
into details Flexibility is an important semantic characteristic of healthy/ 
youth Fixation is a semantic characteristic of old age With the col-1 
loidal background, the imparting of permanent semantic flexibility which 
every one acquires who becomes conscious of abstracting might prove 
to be a crucial neuro-physico-chemical colloidal factor of, at present, 
unrealized power The colloidal behaviour of our ‘bodies’ is dependent 
on electromagnetic , manifestations, which, in their turn, are connected 
with ‘mental’ states of every description If the colloidal ageing, which 
brings on old age, ‘physical’ and ‘mental’ symptoms, and, ultimately, 
death, is connected with such ‘mental’ fixity, we may expect some rather 
startling results if we impart a permanent semantic flexibility The 
‘ageing’ involves electrical changes in the colloidal background, which 
must be connected w'lth the older semantic states The new fluid seman- 
tic states should have different electrical influences, wdiich, in their turn, 
would bring about a difference in the colloidal behaviour on which our 
‘physical’ states depend 

From a A point of view, a new era of human development seems 
possible, in which, by mere structural analysis and a linguistic revision, 
we will discover disregarded semantic mechanisms operating m all of 
us, which can be easily influenced and controlled , and we will discover, 
also, that at least a great deal of prevention can be accomplished 

It seems, also, that we will discover more about the dependence of 
‘human nature’ on the structure of our languages, doctrines, institu- 
tions , and will conclude that for adjustment, stability . , we must adjust 
these man-made and man-invented semantic and other conditions in com- 
formity with that newly discovered ‘human nature’ This, of course, 
w'ould require a thorough scientific 1933, physico-mathematical, epistemo- 
logical, structural, and semantic revision of all existing human interests.

inclinations, institutions , to be made by those specialized in a 'science 
of man’ If such a revision is produced soon enough, it will, perhaps, 
help to adjust peacefully the standards of evaluation and prevent the 
repetition of bloody protests of unenlightened blind forces against 
equally blind forces of existing powers and reactions 

The forces of life, humanity, and time-bindmg are at odds , in mod- 
ern slang, a ‘show-down’ is imminent , it will happen, and no one can 
prevent it To a ^4 understanding the only problem of importance is 
whether this ‘show-down’ will be scientific, enlightened, orderly, and 
peaceful, with minimum suffering; or whether it will take a blind, 
chaotic, silly, bloody, and wasteful turn with maximum suffering 

The problems of structure, language, and ‘consciousness of abstract- 
ing’ play a crucial semantic role To be modern, one must accept modern 
metaphysics and a structurally revised modern language As yet, these 
semantic problems have been completely disregarded as far as general 
education is concerned This is probably due to the fact that in an infan- 
tile and commercial civilization we encourage engineering and applied 
sciences, medicine, biology , to increase private profits , and preserve 
or increase the ranks of buyers But we do not encourage to an equal 
extent branches of science like mathematics, mathematical philosophy, 
linguistic, structural, and semantic researches , which would not directly 
increase profits or the numbers of customers, but which would, never- 
theless, discover structural means for more happiness for all 

Accidentally — and this is recommended to the attention of econo- 
mists — the classical law of ‘supply and demand’ is structurally and 
semantically an animalistic law, which in an adult human civilization 
must be reformulated In fact, an adult human civilization cannot be 
produced at all if we preserve such fundamental animalistic ‘laws’ In 
the animal wmrld the numbers of individuals cannot increase beyond what 
the given conditions allow The animals do not produce artificially. 

Not so with our human world We produce artificially because we 
are time-binders, and all of us stand on the shoulders of others and on 
the labours of the dead We can over-populate this globe as we have done 
Our numbers are not controlled by unaided nature, but can be increased 
considerably In the animal wmrld the numbers are regulated by the 
supply of food , and not by conditions imposed by the animals on that 
food supply The animal law of ‘supply and demand’ is strict. In a 
human class of life, which does produce artificially, production should 
satisfy the wants of all, or their number should be controlled until the 
wants can be filled The application of animalistic laws to ourselves 
makes conditions very complicated, and detrimental to most, if not all

of us It IS also easily understood why it should be so Ignorant and A 
handling of powerful symbols has proved to be dangerous when we do 
not realize the overwhelming semantic role and the importance of sym- 
bols in a symbolic class of life 

Another interesting application of the consciousness of abstracting is 
given in our attitude toward money, bonds, titles to property. Money 
represents a symbol for all human time-binding characteristics Animals 
do not have it No doubt bees produce honey, but these products of the 
bees do not constitute wealth until man puts his hands on them Money 
IS not edible or habitable It is wortliless if the other fellow refuses to 
take it The 711 0 reality behind the symbol is found m human agreement 
The value behind the symbol is doctrinal Fido does not discriminate 
between the different orders of abstractions. If we copy him, we wor- 
ship the symbol alone Tn gold we trust’ becomes the motto, with all its 
identifications and destructive consequences Smith should not identify 
the 771 0 reality behind the symbol with the symbol It is amusing, when 
not tragic, to see how the so-called ‘practical man’ deals mostly with 
fictitious values, for which he is willing to live and die When he has 
the upper hand and ignorantly plays with symbols, disregarding the in 0 
realities behind them, of course, he drn es civilization to disasters His- 
tory is full of examples of this 

We see the utter folly of racing to accumulate symbols, worthless 
in themselves, while destroying the ‘mental’ and ‘moial’ values which are 
behind the symbols For it is useless to ‘own’ a semantically unbalanced 
world Such ownership is a fiction, no matter how stable it may look 
on paper Commercialism, as a creed, is a folly of this t} pc Some day 
even economists, bankers, and merchants will understand that such 
‘impractical’ works as this present one on structure, sr , lead to the 
revision of standards of evaluation and are directly helping the stabiliza- 
tion of an economic system. Meanwhile, in their ignorance, they do their 
best to keep the economic s>stem unscientific, and, therefore, unbal- 
anced History shows clearly how the ruleis have generally made life 
unbearable for the rest of mankind, and what bloody results have fol- 
lowed Since the World War certain conditions are becoming increas- 
ingly more difficult, and the infantile and animalistic systems drive us 
fatalistically toward further catastrophes Whether these disasters will 
occur, the unknown future shall decide, but out of this unknowm, one 
fact remains a certainty , namely, that this will depend on wdiether or not 
science can take hold of human affairs, I hope it can, but the blind 
forces of identification are so strong and powerful that perhaps such

hopes are premature Perhaps a new race can accomplish it after this 
one IS extinct, with the exception of a fei\ remnants in museums 

The problems of determinism and indeterminism are not purely 
‘academic’ but influence, to a large extent, our theories and behaiiour, 
and so are fundamental for adjustment. Historically, science has utilized 
determinism of the two-, and three-valued variety, which has lately, in 
the case of the new er quantum mechanics, proved insufficient The lack 
of the formulation of oo-valued semantics, necessary for t»-ialued 
determinism, seemed to indicate that even science tends to drift toward 
indeterminism, a tendency which was rather baffling and disturbing to 
many scientists 

Diffeient ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ have fought determinism throughout 
all our past on the ground that in a deterministic world all ‘morals’ and 
‘ethics’ would be impossible If a man is compelled to do something, 
then, we are told, he is not responsible They state that the result w'ould 
be undesirable licence, forgetting that determinism implies quite the 
opposite of licence 

We have already become acquainted wnth infantile self-love and 
self-importance These infantile characteristics have not only shaped 
our semantic attitudes, but also our ‘scientific’ theories Smith and this 
little earth were m many ways postulated as the centre of the universe 
Scientific discoveries show’ed that such statements did not cover the facts 
at hand, and Smith was displaced from this primitive and infantile 
self-centred position The Polish astronomer Copernicus w'as the first 
to give this rude shock The little earth was no longer the ‘centre of the 
universe’ Next came Darw m wuth another shock to such infantile pride 
Smith was no longer a ‘special creation’, but belonged to the general 
series of living forms, none of which W’ere ‘special creations’ Finally, 
Freud developed the notion that even m semantic processes, determinism 
prevails All our actions, psycho-logical and semantic states , have very 
definite conscious and unconscious psychophysiological ‘causes’ which 
actuate us 

An infantile society' had difficulties m abandoning their pleasing 
delusions, and these three men were duly' persecuted, criticized, and bit- 
terly' attacked and hated by many 

The present situation may appear baffling because science discor ers 
facts which w'ould seem to lead to an ‘undesirable’ indeterminism in 
science, and to a determinism in ‘mental’ processes The reader, bv now , 
I hope, realizes that both ‘undesirable’ results are only undesirable be- 
cause of identification and the confusion of orders of abstractions, which 
resulted m the ascribing of undue generality and uniqueness to the A

two and three-valued ‘logic’ But once we realize that in a A, oo-valued, 
more general system, the two-, and threc-valucd aspects arc only par- 
ticular instances, uhich apply to some instances but not to others, all 
our difficulties vanish From a A structural point of view we also under- 
stand that on-valued determinism becomes a necessity of our j r in the 
search and comparison of structures 

The result seems to be that the problem of determinism or inde- 
terminism IS not primarily a problem of the outside world, but simply 
one of our j r and ignorance versus ‘knowledge’ Abandoning elemental- 
ism and identification, we stop arguing ‘is the ivorld deterministic or 
not’ , but, by analysis, we find which semantics better fit, structurally, 
the facts and our abstracting capacities The results we reach are not 
entirely new, but the semantic conflict is eliminated 

Science employs determinism because of the stiucture and function 
of our nervous system We cannot do otherwise than preserve oo-valued 
determinism and step by step supply the missing links in our structural 
adjustments of language to the structure of empirical data 

Let us again repeat that the older pioblems of ‘determinism’ tn 
general were the results of elementahsm and identification and of a com- 
plete misunderstanding of the role of structure Once these undesirable 
afflictions are eliminated, the artificial problems which they create are 
also eliminated Structural considerations show clearly that determin- 
ism IS a neurological necessity If empirical facts lead to linguistic 
indeterminism, it is an unmistakable sign that the language used is not 
similar in structure to the structure of the world around us, and that we 
should simply produce a language of different structure Such determin- 
ism is a vital condition in the seaich for stiucture, and cannot be 
abandoned 

Shall we, then, preserve the deterministic attitude m our ‘mental’ 
processes^ Are the objections on ‘moral’ and ‘ethical’ grounds serious 
enough to induce us to reinstate m our semantic attitudes the older 
structurally misleading ‘indeterminism’ ? 

Let us, first, recall the facts In our old el and infantile attitudes 
with identification ive analysed a child or an adult in isolation Determin- 
ism was applied to such a fictitious non-existent individual, and the old 
objectified and el speculations followed If any one is inclined to chal- 
lenge the above statement, let him perform an experiment and imme- 
diately after birth isolate a child ‘completely’ He will find that this 
cannot be done ivith a human baby without destroj mg the child There- 
fore, the old speculations deal with structurally fictitious conditions The 
facts are that a baby is, from the first, subjected to a treatment based

on the semanrics, structure of language, doctrines, understanding, 
knowledge, attitudes, metaphysics , of his parents or their substitutes, 
which sfwpe his snuautic reactions 

If 'i\e abandon the problem of the two-talued ‘determinism’ in con- 
nection with such a fictitious, isolated individual, and apply «-valued 
determinism to an actual, non-isolated individual, we see at once that 
the whole situation is different If parents and society accept gc -trained 
determimsm, they realize their own responsibilities toward the individual, 
and understand that the actions of parents, society. , are, to a large 
extent, responsible for the future development of the cliild on quite 
deterministic ps} chophysiological grounds If an individual behaves in 
a way detrimental to others and to himself, and an enlightened society 
decides to do this or that with him, that is a different proposition. The 
mam point is that, if we were to accept an indeterministic attitude, a great 
deal of harm would be done bj parents, teachers, preachers, and societj' 
in general ; harm w hich could be prevented This is. to a large extent, 
unrealized, and m the old way no one was supposed to be responsible 
except the poor victim of ‘free W'lll’. Under such A conditions, we 
sponsor bitterness, cruelty , under the labels of ‘sin’, ‘justice’, ‘revenge’, 
‘punishment’, or whatever it may be On deterministic grounds, when 
society and educators realize fully their own responsibilities, we should 
blame the individual less, and should more and more investigate struc- 
ture, language, our systems, metaplmics, education, conditions of liv- 
ing, Instead of a holy frenzy for ‘justice’, ‘punishment’, ‘revenge’ , 
we would tiy to improve conditions of life and education, so that a new- 
born individual would not be handicapped fioin the day of his birth 

Since the organism operates as-a-whole and no one is free from 
higher order abstractions and stiuctural assumptions, we see that the 
keeping of savage-made metaphysics must m\olve us mdnidually and 
collectively in an arrested or regiessive development From the organ- 
ism-as-a-whole point of view structural ignorance must result m some 
semantic defectiveness 

The objection that there are cases of great ‘mental’ brilliancy accom- 
panied by very vicious tendencies is easily answered by the fact that the 
problem is formulated m an el way ‘ilental’ bnlliancj does not tell the 
whole story of the organism-as-a-whole One may be ‘mentalh ’ brilliant,

tic components which, once discovered, are childishly simple, and can 
be given m elementary education 

Science represents the highest structural abstractions that have been 
produced at each date It is a supreme abstraction from all the experi- 
ences of countless individuals and generations Since the lower centres 
produce the raw material from which the higher abstractions are made, 
and these higher abstractions again influence the working of the lower 
centres, obviously some means can be devised to put back into the nervous 
circuits the beneficial effects of those highest abstractions 

The above statement may appear visionary, and many are likely to 
say, Tt cannot be done’ Now, the mam contention of the present theory, 
verified empirically, is that it can be done in an extremely simple way, 
provided we study the neglected non-cl aspects of mathematics and 
science, namely, their structural and semantic aspects Such study has 
helped us to discover m a ^-system the means for affecting lower centres 
by the products of the higher centres of the best men we had We have 
already discovered that all adiances in science and mathematics supply 
us with an unbelievable amount of purely psycho-logical and semantic 
data of extreme simplicity, which, without any technicalities, can be 
imparted to the masses in elementary structural education Such educa- 
tion allows us to give very simply to children the 'cultural results’, or to 
imparl the sr, which are the aim of university training, in a relatively 
short period and without any technicalities These benefits, under an A 
education, are too rarely acquired even by uniiersity graduates, and 
impossible to impart to the masses, who are left helpless with archaic, 
delusional structural assumptions 

From one point of view the A issues are childishly simple and ob- 
vious, but from another, because of the power of old established habits 
and s r. are quite difficult for the grown-ups to apply It seems evident 
that an infant must be under the influence of the standards of evaluation 
of those who take care of him, automatically connected wuth the struc- 
ture of the language he is taught Under such unavoidable conditions, 
It IS obvious that to give the full benefit of a /?-system in the training 
of children, parents and teachers should, themselves, have entirely ab- 
sorbed these new standards

disciplines on the base of exact sciences This unification wull require all 
scientists, mathematicians, physicists, and psychiatrists included, to be- 
come acquainted and fully to practice A standards of evaluation A A

up-to-date epistemology. If we trj' to disregard epistemology con- 
sciously, we delude oursehes, as we cannot eliminate some epistemology 
as a foundation for our methods of evaluation, and, therefore, uncon- 
sciously retain some primitive epistemology which through inappropriate 
standards of ey aluation introduces semantic blockages 

Jilach said long ago ‘Not every physicist is an epistemologist, and 
not every one must or can be Special investigation claims a yvhole man, 
so also does the theory of knoyvledge ' The influence of Mach on modern 
science is yvell knoyvn , men such as the late Jacques Loeb, Einstein, the 
younger quantum pioneers , were deeply influenced by the yyTitmgs of 
ilach. because ilach yvas a deep student of epistemoIogy^ But in a H 
society his statement must be slightly reworded, namely ‘Not every 
indiyidual knoyvs or realizes the importance of, or seemingly consciously 
cares for, epistemolog) , yet every one unconsciously has one and acts and 
lives b} it. Each indn idual has his oyvn special problems, the solution of 
which alyy ays claims the yvhole man, and no man is complete, unless he 
consciously realizes the pemianent presence in his life of some standards 
of evaluation Every one has thus some epistemology There is no yvay 
of parting yvith it, — nor with air, nor yvith yvater, — and live The only 
problem is yvhether his standards of evaluation are polluted with primi- 
tive remains of bygone ages, in a variety of yvays , or sanified by science 
and modern epistemology ’ 

The present work shows hoyv any s> stem involves a special epistem- 
ology which yve accept unconsciously, once yve accept the system To 
evaluate a system is practically equivalent to formulating its epistemology 
This is strictly connected with linguistic and structural investigations 

To centralize and co-ordinate the A efforts, an hitermtional Xoii- 
aristotehan Library has been originated, yvhich field embraces, ultimately, 
all knoyvn doctrines and human interests, the first publication being the 
present handbook To facilitate the application of A disciplines and to 
stimulate further researches, an International K on-aristotelian Society 
has been incorporated with headquarters m Neyv York City and branches 
to be established m all cities ol the yvorld yvhich have educational insti- 
tutions The main aims of the Society are scientific and educational for 
the study, by means of papers and lectures folloyved by discussions, of 
the A aspects necessary for a revision and, therefore, a co-ordination 
of all existing sciences and concerns of man As the aspects of science 
■which are of interest to the Society yyould be structural and semantic, 
from the point of view of a general theoiy of values, the lectures yvould 
be of a general non-techmeal character on the level of intelligent laymen

CONCLUDING REMARKS 


555 


Science would not be ‘popularized’ but analysed from a fundamental 
A epistemological point of view, compelling the speakers and authors of 
papers to analyse the deeper non-cl, structural, and semantic foundations 
of experience, as well as of theories The lajman would benefit because 
he would be given a structural education readily understood, uitliout 
being led astray by the older A ‘popularization’ Later, if economically 
feasible, it is intended to issue a monthly International N on-aristotehan 
Reviezv, and also to organize International Non-aristotelian Congresses. 

The ^-system was the result of the^ r of the white race of more than 
two thousand years ago , it built up the doctrines, institutions , appropri- 
ate to this system In those days, knowledge w as very scanty , the intercon- 
nection of different peoples, vague, the means of communications, very 
primitive , It may be considered that science, and particularly mathe- 
matics, began a A revolution by explicitly searching for structure and 
adjusting the structure of the scientific languages, which we usually call 
‘terminology’, ‘theories’. Modern conditions of life are, to a large extent, 
affected by A science but exploited by the thoroughly A doctrines of the 
commercialists, militarists, politicians, priests, lawyers , which results 
m a bewildering chaos, resulting in needless, great, and imposed suffer- 
ing for the great masses of mankind, as exemplified by such cataclysms 
as wars, revolutions, unemployment, different economic crises , 

A disciplines, or science as such, are thoroughly beneficial to man- 
kind at large, but an A exploitation and use of these A products are, 
and must be, a source of endless sufferings to the enormous majority of 
mankind, leading automatically to every kind of break-down It is im- 
possible to give a fuller analysis of this complex interrelation, as this 
would require a separate volume , I shall, therefore, tabulate only a few 
overlapping suggestions

Biological Sciences 

Particularly medicine has discovered 
means of how to keep or restore 
health, how to eliminate suffering, 
how to save and to prolong life , but 
medicine also gives means whereby 
we may prevent the overpopulation of 
this globe and so teaches us how to 
avoid great sufferings through over- 
crowding, which results m bitter 
struggle for food, shelter, employ- 
ment , in turn, leading to wars, 
revolutions, unemployment , . 


Commercialized medicine unavailable to 
great masses of poor people Commer- 
cialism, militarism, infantile dreams 
of ‘world empires’ sponsor unintelli- 
gent breeding in vast numbers which 
runs up the prices of land and houses, 
lowers the price of labour, and sup- 
plies cannon-fodder, The intelligent 
control of numbers of population is 
prevented by jailing and otherwise 
persecuting scientific workers, which 
persecution affects only the poor and 
uneducated

tional A standards of scientific values International Scientific Congresses 
are not only necessary for the ad\anceinent of science, but they also 
explicitly prove science to be entirely international 

The latest, most important A institution is found in the League of 
Nations, which embraces practical!}’ the whole ci\ilized world, with the 
exception of a very few nations who display infantile and A aloofness, 
using different self -deceptive excuses, and, to a large extent, handicap- 
ping the power and usefulness of the League 

As we have learned lately, not only human achievements, but also 
human disasters, are mostly interrelated and international, and are be- 
coming more so every }ear Obiiously, with A narrowness, selfishness, 
shortsightedness, infantilism, commercialism, militarism, nationalism , 
rampant, mankind, to prevent further major A disasters, would have to 
produce a special international body which would co-ordinate various 
structural achievements, strivings , formulate and inform the great 
masses of mankind of the modem scientific A, adult standards of 
evaluation 

At present, we already have the necessary agencies, but, as yet. 
they are inefficient and non-co-ordinated These are to be found in Inter- 
national Scientific Congresses, and the League of Nations The weak 
spots of these organizations are found in the fact that the Scientific 
Congresses are too cumbersome, expensive, non-co-ordinated and onh 
periodic The League of Nations, although a A body in structure, is 
mostly made up of men who do not know any other standards of evalua- 
tion than A, and so they often lack the means to present a scientific, or 
A argument, and usuallv do not realize the tremendous power the} 
would have m a .,d-systein In human affairs, for instance, there cannot 
be a neutral and innocent absentee One such absentee with guns and 
battleships becomes a powerful blocking and so, ultimately, disrupting 
factor for the rest of civilization Such an absentee is not, then, guilt} 
by omission , but, from a A point of view’, becomes guilty by commission 
The League, when definitely and fully allied wnth international science, 
will some day haA e the pluck to make such a declaration and act accord- 
ingly A consciously A League of Nations will not limit itself to the 
thankless and very often useless task of adjusting inevitable clashes of 
A standards of evaluation, but will, wath the full co-operation of scien- 
tists, undertake the much more important, constructive, and unique dut} 
of a guardian and leader of human culture Such a League would be- 
come a scientific, professional, international, co-ordinating, cultural, 
time-binding advisory organization for all nations National A govern-

merits, instead of only instructing their A representatives, would first 
consult with the new A specialists 

Many politicians and their followers often become all but hysterical 
at the mention of the League of Nations, which, in some mysterious way, 
they associate with a ‘super-state’ or ‘control’, . Let me say, at once, that 
a symbolic, or human class of life, is very largely controlled by ignorant, 
hidden, often pathological , factors beyond public control, of which the 
majority are entirely innocent In the human symbolic class of life no 
one IS entirely free, but all our lives are entangled in an interdependence 
of human relations The dependence on those powers which are now 
hidden, and beyond public control, constitutes a grave danger to all Not 
so with a scientific, enlightened public opinion with adult standards of 
evaluation as formulated by a future co-ordination of science and the 
League of Nations Such great majonty-opmions will remain opinions, 
or statements of standards of evaluation, which any one member of the 
League may accept or reject, but, then, it would be necessary for him 
to state publicly his standards of evaluation and to decide consciously 
to act with or against, or to enlighten further the opinion of the human 
race There is, of course, no question of ‘super-states’ or ‘control’ except 
the unified demand for a conscious and explicit stand on any important 
subject by any nation Public opinion will do the rest, once it is con- 
voked to act 

I am not a pacifist m the accepted sense In an animalistic, infantile, 
or A society, this would be not only impossible but downright silly. 
Quite the contrary, I am disgusted with the infantile standards under 
which wars are conducted Thus, our rulers and war lords, sponsored 
by commercialism, like little boys make a sort of game out of wars, and 
thus help to preserve them as an institution In a consistent society, wars 
should be as ruthless as possible to all If any one wants a war, he 
should consistently take all the consequences But this would not suit 
our infantile rulers , they know that when little boys play at war, and one 
group becomes too rough, the other group refuses to play, and so the 
play at war ends “ All these perverted ‘humanitarianisms’ only sponsor 
wars because, in an unlimited modern warfare, the people would soon 
come to their senses and would refuse to suffer for the benefit of the 
very few So I am far from being an A pacifist 

But why our destinies should be dependent on the accidental and 
primitive structure of the language we use , is beyond my comprehen- 
sion I grant that if we accept such and such postulates, two-valued, el, 
structurally false-to-fact A ‘logics’, ‘psychologies’. , all the old, too famil-

lar consequences ioUoiv, which we, in our ignorance, have forced upon 
human life. _ 

But if we put all sj'stems and all 'logics* . on new H foundations, 
which are stnicturall} closer to the facts cf life (1933 i. all the cider 
conclusions may e%en be reversed. The problem now before mankmd 
is w’hether or not the new J-system is more similar in struciure to rhe 
world and our nervous system than the old On the answer to this 
question, the future of civilization depends 

From the present point of view, we should establish whh the 
League of Nations a permanent .1 or saentihc department, composed of 
a few of the best scholars from all countries v.ho ivrmld keep in touch 
not onh with the de-. elopments of rbeir speaalties, but would also 
co-ordinate them on general structural and epistemological foundations 
This department would be the international authonry cn modem revised 
and co-ordinated standards of evaluatijn which would be published in 
special proceedings The present discrepancy and lack of co-ordination 
between different branches of knowledge becomes genuinely alamung 
and detrimental to mankind, because m 1933 ii is humanly impossible for 
a single individual to attempt such a co-ordination Members of this 
group would be selected by the unii ersities of each country. In their 
researches, joint studies, and results, mankind at large would hnd the 
most reliable scientific and opinions produced at each date, and would 
ha\e some definite and conscious standards of etaluation bj- which to 
orient themseh es 

The modern ‘voting’ has some benefits in local affairs, but when its 
very' limited lahdity is not understood, it becomes a serious danger to 
mankind Thus, when we are ill, or when we want a bridge built, we 
ask specialists for their scientific co-operaticn, we would hardly depend 
on ignorant loters. Similarly, ;n a .f scientific chnlization, the major 
problems of mankind would be analysed by scientific specialists, recom- 
mendations offered to be accepted or rejected, as the case may be ; but the 
ignorant voter would have at his disposal an unbiased, impersonal, and 
responsible opinion of international scientific speaalists to compare with 
the equnocations of some local ignorant politician 

To facilitate such future A actmties, the International Non-aristo- 
telian Society has been established It is hoped that soon the scientific, 
educational, 'mental' hygiene., workers will begin to unite on a local 
and national A basis Later, International Congresses wull unite the 
local societies, which ultimately w'lll be embodied as a permanent insti- 
tution, most probably m the League of Nations 



CONCLUDING REIMARKS 


561 


In the process of formulating the above system a curious observa- 
tion has been forced upon me, namely, that statements ^vhich are, for 
instance, quite legitimate for the English language, even though they 
probably apply m general to all Indo-european languages, do not apply 
in a similar degree 

I am intimately acquainted with six languages, two Slavic, two 
Latin, and two Teutonic, and also with the psycho-logical trends of 
these groups I have been led to suspect strongly that the finer differ- 
ences m the structure of these languages and their use are connected wntli 
the semantics of these national groups An enquiry into this problem, 
in my opinion, presents great semantic possibilities and might be the 
foundation for the understanding of international psycho-logical differ- 
ences Once formulated, this would lead us to a better mutual 
understanding, particularly if a ^5 semantic revision of these diffeient 
languages is undertaken To the best of my knowdedge, this field of 
enquiry is entirely new and veiy promising 

It must be obvious to the reader that such a vast program is be\ ond 
the power of a single man to carry out, and the present author hopes for 
public interest in this enterprise 

If the ^-system has accomplished nothing more than to diaw the 
attention of mankind to some disregarded problems ; if it has done noth- 
ing more than point the way, not to panaceas, but to suggestions tow ard 
an expedient, constructive, and unified scientific program whereby future 
disasters may be avoided or lessened — the wTiter will be satisfied

It IS not surprising that our language should be incapable of describing 
the processes occurring within the atoms, for, as has been remarked, it was 
invented to describe the experiences of daily life, and these consist only of 
processes involving exceedingly large numbers of atoms Furthermore, it 
IS very difficult to modify our language so that it will be able to describe 
these atomic processes, for words can only describe things of which we 
can form mental pictures, and this ability, too, is a result of daily experi-

In re mathemalica ars proponendi quaestionem pluns facienda est quam 
solvendi (74) georg c tor 

We cannot describe substance, we can only give a name to it Any at- 
tempt to do more than give a name leads at once to an attribution of struc- 
ture But structure can be described to some extent, and when reduced to 
ultimate terms it appears to resolve itself into a complex of relations 
A law of nature resolves itself into a constant relation, , of the two 
world-conditions to which the different classes of observed quantities form- 
ing the two sides of the equation are traceable Such a constant relation 
independent of measure-code is only to be expressed by a tensor equation 

(148) A S EDDINGTON' 

We have found reason to believe that this creative action of the mind 
follows closely the mathematical process of Hamiltonian differentiation of 
an invariant (148) a s Eddington 

The only justification for our concepts and system of concepts is that 
they serve to represent the complex of our experiences, beyoml this they 
have no legitimacy. I am convinced that the philosophers have had a harm- 
ful effect upon the progress of scientific thinking in removing certain funda- 
mental concepts from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our 
control, to the intangible heights of the a pnori (is 2 ) \ einsiein 


In writing the following semantic survey of a rather wide field of mathe- 
matics and physics, I was confronted with a difficult task of selecting source- 
books. Any mathematical treatise involves conscious and many unconscious 
notions concerning ‘infinity’, the nature of numbeis, mathematics, ‘proof, 
‘rigour’ , which underlie the definitions of further fundamental terms, such as 
‘continuity’, ‘limits’, . It seems that when we discoter a unitersally constant 
empirical relation, such as ‘non-identity’, and apply it, then all other assumptions 
have to be revised, from this new point of mow, irrcspcttiie of what startling 
consequences may follow 

At present, neither the laymen nor the majority of scientists realize that 
human mathematical behaMour has many aspects which should never be 
identified Thus, (1) to be somehow aw'are that 'one and one combine m some 
way into two', is a notion which is common even among children, ‘mentally’ 
deficients, and most primitive peoples (2) The mathematical ‘1 -1-1 =2’ already 
represents a very advanced stage (in theory, and in method ,) of de\ clopmcnt, 
although in practice both of these s r may lead to one result It should be 
noticed that the above (1) represents an inditidual sr, as it is not a general 
formulation, and (2) represents and imoKes a generalized sr Does that 
exhaust the problem of ‘1 -1-1=2’'’ It does not seem to Thus, (3), in the 
Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell which deals w'lth the meanings 
and foundations of mathematics, written in a special shorthand, abbreviating 
statements perhaps tenfold, it takes more than 350 large ‘shorthand’ pages to 
arrive at the notion of ‘number one'

It becomes ob^ious that we should not identify the manipulation of 
mathematical sjmbols with the semantic aspects of mathematics History and 
investigations show that both aspects are necessary and important, although 
of the two, the semantic disco\enes are stnctly connected with the revolu- 
tionary ad\ ances in science, and ha\ e m\ anablj marked a new period of human 
de\elopment In Chapter XXXIX, the reader 11111 find a veiy' impressiie 
example of this general fact Thus, what is known as the ‘Lorentz transforma- 
tion’, looks like the ‘Einstein transformation’ When manipulated numencalh 
both giie equal numerical results, >et the meanings, and the semantic aspects 
are different Although Lorentz produced the ‘Lorentz transformation’ he did 
not, and could not ha\e produced the reiolutionari' Einstein theori 

It is well known that when it comes to the manipulation of simbols 
mathematicians agree, but when it comes to the semantic aspects or meanings , 
they are admittedly hopelessly at lanance In a preiailingly A world we haie 
had no satisfactory’ theory of ‘infinity ’, or a A definition of numbers and 
mathematics This necessarily resulted in the fact that the semantic aspects 
of practically all important mathematical works by different authors often 
iniolve tndivtdiial semantic presuppositions, or orientations concerning funda- 
mentals My presentation intends to be pnmanly semantic and elementary 
and is only remotely concerned with the manipulation of sy mbols A ^-sy stem 
which rejects ‘identity’, differs very widely from A attitudes and introduces 
distinct A requirements I had, therefore, to select from many works, with 
their individual presuppositions, those which were less in conflict with A 
principles than the others 

A survey of important mathematical treatises shows that although the 
majority of modern mathematicians evpliatly abjure the ‘infinitesimal’, yer 
in some presentations, this notion persists In my presentation I reject the 
‘infimtcsimar explicitly and implicitly , although the formulae are not altered. 
‘Modern’ calculus is bised officially on the theory’ of limits, but as the theory 
of limits imolves the unclarified theory of 'infinity' . nothing w’ould be gained 
semantically and for my purpose, had I stressed these formal possibilities of 
the calculus Quite the opposite, if I had done so, I would haie failed to stress 
the most fundamental A principle and task of establishing the similarity of 
structure betiveen languages and the unspeakable levels and happenings as the 
first and crucial consequence of the elimination of identity For these weighti 
reasons, in my presentation, I followed some older textbooks, particularly 
Osgood's, which, from a A point of new, are sounder than the newer, largely 
A rationalizations and apologetics 

However, it should be realized that practically’ all outstanding and creatii e 
mathematicians haie had, and still haie, A attitudes, yet, these prnate bene- 
ficial attitudes, not being formulated m a ^-sy stem, could not become conscious, 
simple, workable, public, and educational assets We can be simple about this 
point With the elimination of identity, structure becomes the only possible 
content of ‘know’ledge’ — and structure of the un-speakable lei els has to be 
discovered Discovery depends on the finding of new, and therefore different

characteristics In the formulation of the last sentence, we cannot make the 
‘training in discovery' an educational discipline The opposite is true in a 
^-system, based on non-identity, as we can train simply and effectively tn non- 
identity, which ultimately leads to differentiation, and so disco\ ery 

Because of the elementary, and purely semantic character of the following 
pages, I have often restrained myself from giving technical, supposedly ‘rigorous’, 
and often A. rationalizations, which we occasionally call definitions In a 
semantic and A treatment, at this pioneering stage, stressing old definitions 
would be seriously confusing, and I wished to avoid such witty wittgensteinian 
‘definitions' as ‘A point in space is a place for an argument' In a number of 
instances, and for my purpose, I often avoided unsatisfactory formal definitions, 
preferring to depend upon the ordinary meanings of words 

For the reader who wishes to acquaint himself with an elementary theory 
of limits and corresponding sets of definitions, I would suggest the book of the 
late Professor J. G Leathern, Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Limits 
(London and Chicago, 1925). This theory is based on Pascal's Calcolo Infini- 
tesimale, Borel's Theorie des foncHons, and Godefroy's Theorie des senes 
Leathern's book has been printed under the supervision of Professor H F 
Baker, F.R S , of the University of Cambridge, and Professor E T Whittaker, 
F R S , of Edinburgh I give these names for professional mathematicians, to 
indicate the semantic trend which underlies this particular treatment of limits 
and which does not greatly conflict with a A outlook This outlook may be 
summarized in part, in the words of Borel somewhat as follows ‘T o the evol u tion 
of physics should correspond an ev'olution of mathematics, which, without 
abandoning the classical and well-tried theories, should develop however, with 
the results of experiments in view' This statement implies vaguely the ‘simi- 
larity of structure' , and so requires as a modus operandi the rejection of identity 
There seems to be little doubfthat a complete and radical revision of the 
semantic aspects of human mathematical behav lour is pending Such a rev ision 
appears to be laborious and difficult, and should be undertaken from the point 
of view of the theory of the unique and specific relations, called numbers I 
doubt if a single man could accomplish this rev ision Such an undertaking vv ill 
probably be the result of group activities, and may, in the beginning, be unified 
by the formulation of one fundamental A principle of non-identity, the disregard 
of which, from science down to 'mental' ills, can be found at the bottom of 
practically all avoidable human difficulties 

The problems are very complicated and extremely difficult, and need to 
be treated from many angles At present, w'e have many scientific societies, 
grouped by their specialties, but we do not have a scientific society composed 
of many different specialists whose work could be unified by some common and 
general principle There can be no doubt that the principle of 'identity', or 
‘absolute sameness in all aspects', is inv'ariably false to facts The main problem 
IS to trace this semantic disturbance of improper evaluation in all fields of science 
and life, and this requires a new co-ordinating scientific body of many specialists, 
with branches in all universities Each group would meet, say monthly, to

di5cu<® their problems, and give mutual technical assistance in tracing this vrst 
general semantic disturbance. Such meetings would stimulate enormoush 
scientific products ity. In fact, ^ ithout such a co-ordinating body, the present 
enormous technical det elopments m each branch of science preclude the revision 
of general pnnciples, on tthich, in the la»t analysis, all other of our actuities 
greatly depend The first task then, is to find a co-ordinating principle, and 
present it to the scientific world 

Pstchiatiy-, and common expenence, teach us, that in heavx* cases of 
dementia praecox we find the most highly developed 'identification' con- 
siderations suggest that any identification, no matter how slight, represents a 
dementia praecox factor in our semantic reactions The rest is only a question 
of degrees of this maladjustment From this point of t iew. tt e will find dementia 
praecox factors even in mathematics In ph\=;ics, only since Einstein has this 
factor of un-sanity been eliminated., and this elimination has already produced 
an ever-growing crop of ‘geniuses', which merely means, that some inhibitions 
of mis-evaluation haie been elimmated from these jounger men, and that thei 
are humanly more ‘normal’ than the others 

In mathematics, from a A point of \iew, we must first of all not identify 
different aspects of our mathemaucal behaiiour, nor tr\ to cover up these 
identifications of endless aspects by the one verj' old term ‘mathematics’. This 
word, ‘mathematics’, in its accepted sense co\ers a non-existing fiction. What 
does exist, and the only thing we actually deal unth, is human mathematical 
behaviour, human j r, and the results of human mathematical behaviour and .c r 
A treatise, say, on a new quantum mechanics, has no \ alue to a monkex or a 
corpse, and only human mathematical behaviour and s r, ha\e any actual itoii-d 
existence, and is the only thing which actually matters So ne see that ‘mathe- 
matics’ co\ers a non-existent fiction if elenieniahstically separated from human 
mathematical behax lour and s r I use the term ‘mathemaucs’ in the non-el 
sense, and attempt to signalize some of the difficulties non-elementalism in\ oh es 
at this transitory- stage 

From a A non-identity , structural, non-cl point of xiew, human mathe- 
matical behai lOur must be treated uniquely as a phy sico-mathematical discipline, 
and postulational method= to be used exclusnely as a most valuable cheikii g 
method To base mathematical behaMour and j r on postulational methods 
exclusively', is to introduce dementia praecox factors into saence, which only 
induces the spread of semantic maladjustment in life 

Our mam task in producing a A rex ision of mathematical J r, is in the 
elimination of identification from our's r about ‘infinity ' and m the formulation 
of a A definition of numbers in terms of relations This would enable us to 
rebuild human mathematical s r from a theory' of numbers point of view, as a 
physico-mathematical discipline The intrinsic, or internal theory' of surfaces, 
and the tensor, or absolute calculus, are methodologically our most secure 
epistemological guides. 

I xx'ould suggest that mathematical and scientific readers who are interested 
in a A rex'ision should, at first, in their special fields, sketch in techmeal papers. 



PREFATORY REMARKS

presented before the local International Non-aristotelian Societies, A pitfalls 
and A problems and outlooks Only after this is done, shall e be able to begin 
a co-ordination of their findings, and thereby initiate a rc\ ised and unified A 
science, mathematics, and perhaps ultimately a saner scieniific amlizahon. 

The scientific achievements dealt with in Book III, are developing so 
rapidly, and the technical points of view alter so often, that on a static printed 
page it is impossible to do them justice The writer has spared no efforts to 
keep informed of these scientific developments until two weeks before the 
appearance of this book, yet because these new developments do not represent 
new and fundamental semantic factors, I deliberately do not include them here 
In some instances, a given author may seem to change his opinions, but, from 
a A point of view, it sometimes appears that the original notions were more 
justified, and so I preserved them without change 

The following pages are written exclusively from a semantic point of v lew, 
an undertaking which is far more difficult than dealing with a restricted technical 
physico-mathematical problem, because it inv'olves second order observations, 
of the first order observations, of the first older observer, and of the relations 
between them , . When it came to a final revision of the manuscript, and reading 
of the proofs, I found that dealing with so many v'aried fields, languages, and 
symbolisms at one period, was no small task, and I only hope that I have not 
over-looked too many errors or misprints 

If we must have slogans, a A motto readily suggests itself — ‘Scientists of 
the world unite' Perhaps this motto may prov e moi e constructiv e and workable 
than the familiar A elementahstic slogans which have mostly led to the dis- 
membering of human society Protests against any misrule should not be 
confused with the proclaiming of disrupting general principles Let me repeat 
once more, that the most lowly manual worker is useful only because of his 
human nervous system, which produced all science, and which differentiates 
him from an animal, and not primarily for his hands alone, otherwise we would 
breed apes to do the world's work 

In the explanations of some geometrical notions, and some parts of the 
theory of Einstein, I have followed often very closely the Einstein's Theory of 
Relativity by Max Born, which is easily the best elementary exposition I have 
read, and also the books of Eddington In the quanium field I have followed 
mostly the books by Biggs, Birtwistle, Bochcr, Haas, and Sommcrfeld, and I 
wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to the above authors 

I am also under heavy obligations to Professors E T Bell, P Bridgman, 
B F. Dostal, R J Kennedy, and G Y Rainich, who were so kind as to read 
the MS and/or proofs, and whose criticism and suggestions were invaluable 
to me However, I assume entire responsibility for the following pages, especially 
since I have not always followed the suggestions made. 




PART VIII 


ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


Bein^ myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself 
the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that 
are not hard Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow What 
one fool can do, another can (Sio) silvanus p Thompson 

Besides the theory of surfaces is the model on which all the higher theories 
are built and must be built, and it is well to master it completely before 
attempting generalizations (425) g y kaimch 

To find such relations Einstein has applied a mathematical method of 
great power — ^the calculus of tensors — with extraordinary success The 
calculus threshes out the laws of nature, separating the observer's eccen- 
tricities from what is independent of him, with the superb efficiency of a 
modern harvester (2i) e t bell

CHAPTER XXXII 


ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 

The principle of gaining knowledge of the external world from 
the behaviour of its infinitesimal parts is the mainspring of the theory 
of knowledge in infinitesimal physics as in Riemann’s geometry, and, in- 
deed, the mainspring of all the eminent work of Riemann, in particular, 
that dealing with the theory of complex function (S47) herm\nn weyl 
The conception of tensors is possible owing to the circumstance that the 
transition from one co-ordinate system to another expresses itself as a 
linear transformation in the differentials One here uses the exceedingly 
fruitful mathematical device of making a problem "linear” by reverting 
to infinitely small quantities (S47) Hermann weyl 

Section A Introductory 

In the first draft of this book written in 1928, the following pages preceded 
Part VII In a final revision in 1032, it seemed advisable to transfer pages 
nhich to laymen look ‘mathematical’, to the end of the volume, because the 
majority of even intelligent readers ha\e a sort of ‘inferiority complex' about 
anything ‘mathematical’ 

The patient reader knows by now, I hope, that on neurological grounds, 
he must for the sake of sanity, be able to translate the dynamic into the static, 
and the static into the dynamic, and also that he must know at least about 
the modern structure of ‘space’, ‘time’, ‘matter’ These conditions seem 
essential for sanity, and so I had no choice but to gi\e the minimum of a 
structural and semantic outline, and to acquaint the reader with the existence 
of modern scientific problems and vocabularies It is not my aim to teach 
the reader mathematics or modern physics I must limit myself to structural 
and semantic issues, for there are excellent elementary books which will gite 
him the necessary informations 

The following pages should in no way intimidate the intelligent reader 
Elementary structural statements and definitions are gi\ en in simple language, 
followed by illustrations to render their meanings more understandable The 
pages are less technical than they look, as each example is carried through 
in the most elementary way in all of its details, so as to make easy reading 
A real difficulty for some readers may' come from the semantic blockage created 
by the use of apparently strange, and, to them, unknown terms, or from a 
feeling of fright or abhorrence of anything mathematical, due to deplorably 
faulty introduction to some branch of mathematics at the hands of some 
teacher innocent of the broader epistemological aspects of science. I am 
acquainted with scientists of tcry considerable mathematical gifts, tvho have 
had to overcome this phobia of mathematics. Once the word ‘mathematics’ 
was mentioned to them, they became ‘mentally’ paralysed An ‘emotional’ 
fright seized them and it took some months to overcome this undesirable 
childish s r I use the subject of mathematics as an illustration of this difficulty, 
because I want to contrast the comparative simplicity of mathematical notions

with the complexity of human problems and language For when we ha\e 
understood the simplest notions, which happen to be mathematical, then only 
shall we be able better to understand our human problems, which are in 
comparison so difficult and so confused 

Any reader who has a distaste for mathematics will benefit most if he 
overcomes his semantic phobia and struggles through these pages, even se\ eral 
times. As a result of so doing he will find it simple although not alwai s easv. 
It IS always semantically useful to overcome one's phobias, it liberates one from 
unjustified fears, feelings of inferiority. The main point of this iihole dis- 
cussion IS to evoke the semantic components of a li\ ing Smith, when he 
habitually uses the method which will be explained herewith This method is 
so simple and so fundamental that in the form given by a A-s} 'stem and further 
simplified according to the gifts of the teacher, it will some day be introduced 
into elementary schools without technicalities, as a preventive semantic method 
against 'insanity', un-sanity and other nervous and semantic difficulties, and 
as a foundation for a training in sanity and adjustment 

Section B On the Differential Calculus 

1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

As we hate already seen, the structural notion of a function is strictly 
connected with that of the variable The variable on one level does not ‘vary 
It IS a selection by Smith of a definite value from a git en set As these processes 
are going on inside of the skin of Smith he might experience on a different 
level a feeling of ‘change’ The method of dealing with such problems is git en 
by the mathematical differential and integral calculus 

The beginnings of methods dealing with ‘change’ are to be found even 
among the ancients Galileo, Roberval, Napier, Barrow, and others were 
interested in ‘fluxional’ methods, before Newton and Leibnitz.* The epoch- 
making discoveries of the last two mathematicians consisted not only in 
perfecting the knowledge they had and in inventing new methods, but also — 
and tins is perhaps the most important — ^they formulated a general theory of 
these structural methods and invented a new notation suitable for their purpose 
The definite abandonment of the old tentative methods of integration in faiour 
of methods in which integration is regarded as the inverse of differentiation 
was especially the work of Newton Leibnitz’ main wmrk was in the field of 
precise formulation of simple rules for differentiation in speaal cases and the 
introduction of a very useful notation 

It IS not an e.xaggeration to say that the calculus is one of the most inspiring, 
creatixe, structural methods in mathematics There is little doubt that the 
analysis of the foundations of mathematics, and their revision, was suggested 
by a study of the methods of the calculus It is striiclurally and semanticalh 
the ‘logic’ of sanity and, as such, can be gi\ en ultimately without technicalities 
by the present A -system and semantic training, with the aid of the Structural 
Differential 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 575 


The application of the differential calculus to geometry produced differential 
geometry This prepared the way for the notions of Einstein and Minkowski 
The whole of modern physics becomes possible through the calculus, and 
it will probably be correct to say that the achievements of the future also will 
be dependent on it 

The present ■work is also to a large extent inspired by it, and develops 
simple non-technical methods by which the ps>cho-logical structural 5 r 
necessitated by the calculus can be given to the masses in elementary education 
ivithout any technical knowledge of it This statement does not include 
teachers, who should be acquainted with at least the rudiments of the calculus ^ 
It IS true that in the beginning we did not suspect that the semantics of 
the calculus are indispensable in education for sanity It is the only structural 
method which can reconcile the as yet irreconcilable higher and lower order 
abstractions Without such a reconciliation, at our present level of develop- 
ment, sanity is a matter of good luck quite beyond our conscious or educational 
control 

Let us recall the rough definition of a function y is said to be a function 
of X if, when x is given, y is determined In symbols we write y=J{\) which 
we read 'y is equal to a function of x’ or ‘y is equal to / of v’ If y is a function 
of *, or y=/(x), then * is called the independent variable, being the one to 
which we arbitrarily assign any value we choose out of a gi\en set of talues 
The y is called the dependent variable as its value depends on the \alue we 
assign to X 

A function may have more than one independent variable, m which case 
we have a function of several variables It happens frequently that to one 
value of the independent variable there may correspond several values of the 
dependent variable Then y is said to be a multiple-valued function of v 

Roughly speaking, a function is said to be continuous if a small increment 
in the variable gives rise to a small increment of the function 

A theory of functions can be dev'eloped without any references to graphs 
and geometrical notions of co-ordinates and lengths, but in practice (and in 
this work), it is extremely useful to introduce these geometrical notions, as 
they help intuition A modern definition of an analytic function is technical 
and unnecessary for our puipose Suffice it to say that it is connected with 
derivatives and power series, which means structure 

Geometry is a very remarkable science It may be treated as pure mathe- 
matics, or It may be treated as physics It may therefore be used as a link 
between the two or as a link between the higher and lower order of abstractions. 
This fact IS of tremendous psy'cho-logical and semantic importance It is not 
by pure ‘chance’ that the most important writers on mathematical philosophy, 
authors who have generalized their knowledge of mathematics to include 
human results, were mostly geometers 

Indeed, Whitehead, in his Universal Algebra (p 32), says, and justly so, 
that a treatise on univ'ersal algebra is also a treatise on certain generalized 
notions of ‘space’ 'Space' should be understood as ‘fulness’, ‘fulness of some- 



576 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


thing’, a plenum Naturally coherent speech, like universal algebra, must be 
coherent speech about something ‘Generalized space’ becomes generalized 
plenum, and so it belongs to two realms One is contentless and formal, hence 
generalized algebra, the other, in that it refers to a generalized plenum, becomes 
generalized geometry, or generalized physics 

The mam importance, perhaps, of geometry is in the fact that it can be 
interpreted both ways One way appears as pure mathematics, and therefore 
as the study of sets of numbers representing co-ordinates The other takes the 
form of an interpretation, in which its terms imply a connection with the 
empincal entities of our world Obviously if speech is not the things spoken 
about, w'e must have a special discipline which will translate the coherent 
language of pure mathematics, which is contentless by definition, into another 
way of speaking w hich uses a different vocabulary capable of both interpretations 
Again, the different orders of abstractions, which our nervous structure 
produces, are perfectly reflected in the very structure and methods of mathe- 
matics The possibility of the use of the ‘intuitions’ of lower order abstractions, 
is extremely useful in pure mathematics This fact makes geometry also unique 
It allows us to apply to the development of geometry both orders of abstrac- 
tions — the ‘intuitions’, ‘feelings’, of the lower order of abstractions, and the 
static, ‘quantum’ ] ump methods of pure anal> sis This is also why the einstemian 
physics becomes four-dimensional geometry, which, because it can be treated 
on both levels of abstraction, gives tremendously powerful and important 
psycho-logical means for sanity and nervous co-ordination of the individual 
Since Einstein, many far-sighted scientists have said that although they do 
not know m w hat respect the Einstein theory will affect our lives, yet they feel 
that it will have a tremendous influence. I venture to suggest that the bearing 
of the Einstein theory and its development on the problems of sanity, as 
explained in this work, is a new and unexpected semantic result of the application 
of modern science to our liv es As the Einstein theory could have been formu- 
lated more than two hundred years ago when the finite velocity of light w'as 
discovered, so the present theory is also several hundred years overdue The 
only consolation W'e have left is that it is better late than never 

The scope of this work allows us to go but a little beyond these simple 
remarks, and permits only a v'ery brief explanation of the most fundamental 
and elementary beginnings of the calculus In this presentation I shall appeal 
very often to intuition (lower order abstractions), as this will help the reader 
The notion of differentiation of a continuous function is the process for 
measuring the rate of growth, that is to say, the evaluation of the increment 
of the function as compared wuth the growth or increment of the variable 
We may describe this process as follows If y is a function of x, it is helpful not 
to consider x as having one or another special value but as flowing or growing, 
]ust as we feel ‘time’ or follow the ripples made by a stone thrown into a pond 
The function y varies with x, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing 
We have already defined the variable as any value selected from a given range 
Let us consider our x as given in the interval between 1 and 5 We are now 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 577 


interested in all \alues which our x may take between these tivo values, or, as 
we saj , in this interxal Obxioualy we can select a few xalues, or, in other 
words, take big steps, as, for instance, assigning to x the successixe xalues 
= X2 = 2, X3=3, X4 = 4, X3 = 5 In such a case we would haxe few xalues 
and the difference betxveen two successix-e xalues xvould be rather large, for 
instance, xj — \2 = 1 But such large differences are not of much interest to us 
here We max, if we choose, select smaller differences, in other xx’ords, assign 
more xalues to our xariable in the gixen range 

Let us take, for instance, for our x the series of values 1, 1^, 2, 2^, 3, 
3§i 4, 4§, 5 Here xve see that the difference between two successixe xalues 
IS smaller than 1, it is J So x\e already hax-e nine, instead of the former fixe, 
xalues wLich xx'e may assign to our x Thus we haxe selected smaller steps by 
which to proceed Let us select still smaller steps, for instance, i Our exten- 
sional manifold of x'alues for x in the interval betxx'een 1 and 5 xx'ould then be 
1, I4. 1^1 If. 2, 2\, 2^, 2|, 3, 3i, 3i, 3f, 4, 4f, 4i 4|, S V\ e see that in the 
interxal between 1 and 5, xxe haxe already 17 xalues which xxe may assign to 
our x-ariable, but w'e haxe followed the ‘groxvth’ of our x by smaller steps, 
namely, bj steps of f If xve choose to diminish the steps to lo, we xvould hax e 
for our exrensional manifold of xalues 1, 1 1, . . , 1 9, 2, 2 1, , 2 9, 3, 

3 1 3 9, 4, 4 1, . , 4 9, 5 in all, 41 xalues for v, an> txx-o succeeding 

\ alues differing by po If " ® select still smaller steps — let us sa> , 155 — we hax e 
401 xalues for x and the difference berxx-een txio successixe x alues is still smaller, 
namelx, 3^. This process may be carried on until we haxe a» man} numbers 
between 1 and 3 as xx-e choose, since xxe may make the difference between suc- 
cessixe numbers in the sequence as small as we please In the limit, between 
any two numbers, let us sax. 1 and 2. or an> txxo fractions, there are infinite 
numbers of other numbers or fractions It is obxious that in a gixen interxal, 
let us say, between 1 and 5, xxe can haxe an indehnittlv large number of inter- 
mediaiy numbers arranged in an increasing progression, such that the difference 
between txxm succe,ssi\e numbers can be made smaller than any ass’gned xalue, 
w hich is Itself greater than zero 

1 he abox'e may be made clearer bx 
a geometrical illustration Let us take 
a segment of a line of definite length, 
let us say 2 inches Let us designate 
the ends by numbers 1 and 3 In figure 
(A) xve dixide the segment into 2 equal 
parts of one inch each, and see that to 
reach 3 starting xx'ith 1 w^e hax e to pro- 
ceed by txx'o large jumps from 1 to 2, 
and from 2 to 3 In figure (B) w e hax-e more steps in the intern al and therefore 
the steps are smaller. In figures (C) and (D) the steps are still smaller and their 
number greater. If the number of steps is x'ery large, the steps are x eiy small. 
In the limit, if the numbers of steps become infinite, the length of the steps tends

toward zero and the aggregate of such points of di\ision represents (in the 
rough only) a continuous line 

It IS important that the reader should become thoroughly acquainted 
with the above simple considerations as the> will be \ery useful in any line ol 
cndea\our Here we already have learned how, somehow, to translate dis- 
continuous jumps into ‘continuous’ smooth entities Because of the structure 
of our nervous system we ‘feel’ ‘continuity’, jet we can analj'se it into a smaller 
or larger number of definite jumps, according to our needs The secret of this 
process lies in assigning an increasing number of jumps, which as they become 
vanishingly small, or tend to zero, as we say, cease to be felt as jumps and 
are felt as a ‘continuous’ motion, or change, or growth or anj thing of this sort 

An excellent example is given by the motion pictures \\ hen w e look at 
them we see a very good representation of life with all its continuitj' of 
transitions between joj' and sorrow If we look at an arrested film we find a 
definite number of static pictures, each differing from the next bj- a measurable 
difference or j'ump, and the joy or soirow which moved us so in the plaj' of the 
actors on the moving film, becomes a static manifold of static pictures each 
differing measurably from its neighbour by a slightly more or less accentuated 
grimace If W'e increase the number of pictures m a unit of ‘time’ by using a 
faster camera and then release this film at the ordinary speed, we get what is 
called slow motion pictures with which we are all familiar In them we notice 
a much greater smoothness of movements which in life are jerky, as, for instance, 
the movements of a running horse They appear smooth and non-jerky, the 
horse looks as if it were swimming Indeed we do swim no less than fishes, 
except that our medium, namely, air, is less dense than water, and so our 
moxements have to be more energetic to oxcrcome gra\itation The aboxe 
example is indeed the best analogy in existence of the w'orking of our nervous 
system and of the difference between orders of abstractions Let us imagine 
that some one wants to study some event as presented by the moving picture 
camera What would he doi* He would first see the picture, in its mox'ing, 
dynamic form, and later he would arrest the movement and devote himself 
to the contemplation of the static extensional manifold, or series, of the static 
pictures of the film It should be noticed that the differences between the 
static pictures arc finite, definite and meastiiable 

The pow'er of analjsis which we humans possess in our higher order 
abstractions is due precisely to the fact that they are static and so we can take 
our ‘time’ to investigate, analyse , The lower order abstractions, such as 
our looking at the moving picture, are shifting and non-permanent and thus 
ex-ade any serious analysis. On the level of looking at the moving film, we get 
a general feeling of the events, with a very imperfect memory of w hat w e hav e 
seen, coloured to a large extent by our moods and other ‘emotional’ or organic 
states We are on the shifting level of lower order abstractions, ‘feelings’, 
‘motions’, and ‘emotions’. The first lower centres do the best they can m a 
given case but the value of their results is highly doubtful, as they are nut 
especially reliable Now the higher order abstractions are produced bj the 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 579 


higher centres, further removed, and not in direct contact with the world around 
us With the finite veluciLj of nerve currents it takes ‘time’ for impulses to 
reach these centres, as the cortical pathways offer higher neural resistances 
than the other patlrwajs** So there has to be a survival mechanism in the 
production of nervous means for arresting the stream of events and producing 
static pictures of permanent character, which may allow us to investigate, 
verify, analyse , 1 1 must be noticed that because of this higher neural resistance 

of higher centres and the static character of the higher abstractions, these 
abstractions are less distorted by affectiv e moods For, since the higher abstrac- 
tions persist, if we care to remember them, and the moods v ar> , w e can con- 
template the abstractions under different moods and so come to some average 
outlook on a given problem It is true that we seldom do this, but we may do 
It, and this is of importance to us 

As one of the aims of the calculus is to study relative rates of change 
we will consider a scries of successive values of our variable which differ by 
little from each other If we have y=/(v) we can consider the change in .r for 
a short interval, let us say, from ao to vi, so that we assign to our v two v'alues, 
\ =Aoand i = vi The corresponding values of our function or y will be yo=/(vo) 
and j'l =/(vi) In general, small changes in y will be almost proportional to the

The above ratio represents the ratio of the increment of the function to the 
increment of the variable In the limit when the increment in the variable 
becomes vanishingly small or w^hen Av tends toward zero, and our function is 
continuous, the limit of this ratio gives us the law of change or growth of 
our function

Let us illustrate this by a simple numencal example Take the equation 
y = V- and assume that v = 100, whence y = 10,000 Suppose the increment of x, 
namely, Av = l/10 Then v-|-Av = 100 1 and (v-t-Av)“ = 100 1 XlOO 1 =10020.01. 
The last 1 is l/lOO and only one millionth part of the 10,000, and so, we can

neglect it and consider y+Ay = 10,020, whence Ay =20 and Ay /A\ =20/0 1 =200 
Tn the general case, if y = \^ and instead of v we take a slightly larger value, 
Jc+Av, then our function y also becomes slightly larger, thus, 
y-j-Ay = (f+Av)® =.t*+2rAr +(At)® 

I f we subtract y = v* from the last expression we ha\ e 

Ay = 2vAx+(AA.)®, dividing by Ar, we ha\e 
Ay/Ax = 2v+Av 

In the limit as Ax approaches zero, the xalue of the above ratio, or the rate of 
change of our function, would be 2-v:, as Ax would disappear If our x = 100, the 
above ratio w'ould be 200, as determined above in the case of the numerical 
example Another way of sjmbolizing the derivative is Dxy =dyfdx, but this 
requires a short explanation 

In Chapter XV we have already discussed the problem of the ‘infinitesimal’ 
and we have seen that ‘infinitesimal’ is a misnomer and that there is no such 
thing at all Yet this word is very often uncritically used by mathematicians 
and IS therefore often confusing By an ‘infinitesimal’ mathematicians mean a 
variable which approaches zero as a limit The condition that it should be a 
variable is essential It would probably be better to call an ‘infinitesimal’ an 
mdefiiutely small quantity or ‘indefinitesimal’, and that is what the reader 
should understand when he sees anywhere the word ‘infinitesimal’ or ‘infinitely 
small quantity’ 

These indefinitely small quantities are in general neither equal, nor even 
of one order Some by comparison are indefinitely smaller than others, and 
hence are said to be ‘of higher order’ Usually several quantities are considered 
w Inch approach zero simultaneously In such a case one of them is chosen as 
the pnncipal indefinitely small quantity Let us recall that if we take any 
number, for example, 1, and divide it by 2 w'e have 1/2 If wc divide 1 by 4 
w e hav c 1 /4 vv hich is smaller than 1 /2 , if we div ide 1 by 10 we hav e 1 / 10 which 
IS still smaller If we carry this process on indefinitely, taking larger and larger 
denominators, the results are fractions of smaller and smaller values In the 
limit, as the value of the denominator becomes indefinitely large the value 
of the fraction approaches zero This simple consideration will help us in the 
classification of indefinitely small quantities 

Let us take a as the principal indefinitely small quantity and 6 another 
indefinitely small quantity If the ratio b/a approaches zero with a we say 
that b Is an indefinitely small quantity of higher order with respect to a In 
other w ords, although a approaches zero in the limit yet it is infinitely larger 
than b and so the ratio b/a also approaches zero, 

If the ratio b/a, approaches a limit k different from zero as a approaches 
zero, then b is said to be of the ‘same order’ as a and b/a=k + B where e is in- 
definitely small with respect to o In such a case b (k + t) =ka+ae, and ka is 
called the principal part of b The term at is obviously of a higher order than a 
We may say in general that if we have a power of a, for instance a", such 
that the ratio b/a” approaches a limit different from zero, b is called an 
infinitesimal’ (indefinitesimal) of order n with respect to a. 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 581 


Let us give a numerical illustration We know that there are 60 minutes 
m one houi, 24 hums in a daj , or that there aie 1440 minutes in a day, and by 
multiplying 1440 by 7, that there are 10,080 minutes m a w eck Our forefathers 
called this 1/10,080 pait of a week a ‘minute’ because of its minuteness It is 
obvious that a minute is very small as compared with a week But if we sub- 
divide a minute into 60 equal parts vv'e hav'e a still smaller quantity, a quantity 
of second order smallness and so we called it a second Indeed there arc 3600 
seconds in one hour, 86,400 seconds in a day and 604,800 seconds in a week 
If we decide that for some purpose a minute is as short a period of ‘time’ as we 
need to consider, then the second, 1/60 of a minute, is relativ^ely so small that 
It could be neglected In a calculation where 1/100 of some unit is the smallest 
value which needs to be considered, we may define this 1/100 as of first order 




Fig 1-B 


smallness Then 1/100 of 1/100, or 1/10,000, of that unit, which is relatively 
of second order smallness, is entirely negligible The fractions w^hose smallness 
we are considering here are comparatively laige, and we usually deal with 
much smaller quantities, but the smaller a quantity is, the more negligible 
the correspondingly smaller quantity of higher order becomes 

Let us consider a geometrical interpietation of the above If we represent 
a quantity « by a line segment, and a slightly greater quantity, a -|-dv, by a 
slightly longer line segment, then the quantities .v^ and +dx)^ =x^ +2\d\ -Kdv)^ 
may be represented bj squares where sides are the line segments which represent 
the quantities x and x+dv respectively 

If we denote the areas hy A, B, C D, wc see that A =\^ and that 
A-\-B ■\-C-\-D =x--\-'2-'xdx-\-{d\Y. If we select our d\ smaller and smaller the 
areas B =C=xdx diminishing in one dimension only, become also smaller and 
smaller, but D = (dxY is vanishing much more rapidly as it is diminishing in 
each of two dimensions, whence it is said to be a quantity of second order 
smallness, which for all purposes at hand may be neglected 

If we take y=/W and its derivative

582 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


In the above expression Dij'Ax represents the principal part and eAx appears 
as an indefinitesimal of higher order This principal part is called the dif- 
ferential of y and is denoted b> dy If «e choose ff v) =.v we have dx = Ax and 
so, dy =Dzy dx. 

So we see that the differential of the independent \anable x is equal to 
the increment of that variable This statement is not generalh' true about 
the dependent variable, as e does not generallj vanish 

The denv'ative is also sometimes denoted as/'fv) or y' and this notation 
IS due to Lagrange, all three notations are used and it is well to be acquainted 
with them 

The derivative of a function f(x) is in general another function of x, let 
us sayf'(x). If/'fv) has a denvative, the new function is the derivative of the 
derivative or the second derivative olf(x) and is denoted b> y" OTf"( vj. Similarh 
the third denvativ'e y'" or f'"(x) is defined as the denvative of the second 
denvative and so on In the other notations we have 

d/d)\ iT-v 

Having introduced these few definitions it must be emphasized that the 
mam importance of the calculus is in its central idea, namel>, the studj of a 
continuous function by following its histoiy by indefinitely small steps, as the 
function changes when we give indefinitely small increments to the independent 
variable As was emphasized before, the whole psycho-logics of this process is 
intimately connected with the activities of the ncnoits structure and also with 
the structure of science In this W'ork we are not interested in calculations, 
complications, or analj tical niceties. Mathematicians hav e taken excellent care 
of all that We need only to know about the structure and method w hich help 
to translate dynamic into static, and vice versa, to translate ‘continuitj' on 
one lev el, or order of abstraction, into ‘steps’ on another 

To illustrate what has been said and to give the reader the/er/ of the process, 
let us take for instance a simple equation 3' = 2x’ — v-r5 where y represents the 
function of the vanable v exijresscd b> a group of symbols to the nght of the 
sign of equalitv 

To determine the relative rate of growth of this function, that is, to 
differentiate it, we replace x by a slightly larger value, namelj , x+\x, and see 
what happens to the expreosion 2v^ becomes 2(v -(-At)® =2v^ -l-6v°Avi-6.v(A.i:)^ 
-(-2(Ax)®, — x becomes — v— A.v and the constant 5 remains unchanged. In 
symbols, y-|-A3'=2v^-|-6v^Av-|-6v(AK)*-t-2(Av)® — V— Ai -t-5, where Ay repre- 
sents the increment of the function and Av represents the increment of the 
independent v ariable 

Subtracting the original expression y=2v’ — v-|-5 we get the amount bv 
which the function has been increased, namely 

Ay = 6 v*Ay -|-6.v(Av)- -)-2(Ay)® — Av 

To determine the relation, or ratio, of Ay, the increment of the function, to Av 
the increment of the independent variable which produced Ay, we divide 
Ay by Ax, and obtain the equation 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 583 


7^ = 63c’ +63 i:Av +2(A*)® — 1 
Ax 

Then as Ax approaches 0 the terms in the nght-hand side of the equation 
which contain An as a factor also approach 0 and replacing the left-hand side 
dy dy 

by — we obtain the equation — = 6*^ — 1 which means, that as A\ approaches 0, 
dx dx 

the ratio of the increment of the function to the increment of the independent 
variable approaches 6\“ — 1, true for any value we may arbitrarily assign to x 
It should be noticed that in our function the left-hand side represents 
the ‘whole’ as composed of interrelated elements which are represented by the 
right-hand side When instead of x we selected a slightly larger value, namely, 
x-f-A-v, we performed upon this altered value all the operations indicated by 
our expression We thus have in mathematics, because of the self-imposed 
limitations, the first and only example of complete analysis, impossible in 
physical problems as in these there are alwa>s characteristics left out 

An important structural and methodological issue should also be empha- 
sized In the calculus we introduce a ‘small increment’ of the variable, we 
performed upon it certain indicated operations, and in the final results this 
arbitrary increment disappeared leaving important information as to the 
rate of change of our function This device is structurally extremely useful 
and can be generalized and applied to language with similar results 

It has been noticed already that the calculus can be developed without any 
reference to graphs, co-ordinates or any appeal to geometrical notions, but as 
geometry is an all-important link between pure anahsis and the outside W'orld 
of physics, we find in geometry also the psycho-logical link between the higher 
and lower orders of abstraction But the appeal to geometrical notions helps 
intuition and so is extremely useful For this reason we will explain briefly a 
system of co-ordinates and show what geometrical significance the derivative has 
We take in a plane two straight lines X'X and T'F, intersecting at 0 at 
right angles, so that X'OX is horizontal extending to the left and right of 0, 
and YOY', is vertical, extending above 
and below O, as a frame of reference 
for the locations of point, lines, and 
other geometrical figures in the plane 
We call this a two-dimensional rec- 
tangular system of co-ordinates This 
method may be extended to three di- 
mensions, and our points, lines, and 
other geometrical figures referred to a 
three-dimensional rectangular sj stem of 
co-ordinates consisting of three mutually 
perpendicular and intersecting planes 

As we see in Fig. 2, we have four quadrants I, II, III, IV, formed by the 
intersecting axes X'X and Y' Y The co-ordinates of a point P, by which we

mean the distances from the axes determine the position of the point uniquclj 
We call X'X and Y'Y the axis of X and the a\ts of Y rcspectn cly, and O the 
origin. If "we select a point Pi in the plane of X'X and Y' Y and draw' a line 
PiM perpendicular to X'X then OM and AIPi are called the co-ordinates 
of Pi, OM IS called the abscissa and is denoted hy x=b, and MPi is called the 
ordinate and denoted b> y=a We speak of Pi as the point (b,a), or, in general, 
of any point as the point (.'1,3') 

Let us draw OX — OM = b and draw lines P1P4 and PaPa through M and -V 
respectively perpendicular to X'X, making J/P4 = -VP2 = .VP3 = .I/Pi =a We 
then have four points Pi, P2, P3, P4, m each one of the four quadrants and 
all of them by construction would have equal numerical talues for their 
abscissas and ordinates To be able to discriminate between the four quadrants, 
and so avoid ambiguit3', we make the convention that all \alues of y aboie 
X'X are to be positive and below X'X negative, and all values of x to the right 
of Y'Y positi\e, to the left negati\e Thus we see that b3' such conventions 
the point Pi would have both b and a positive, P2 would have b negative and 
a positive, P3 both b and a negative, and finally P4 would have b positive and 
a negative, or in 33 mbols Pi(b,a), Pii—b.a), Psi—b, —a); and finally Pi(b, —a) 

It IS obvious that for any point on the X avis (for instance M) the ordinate 
y—Q If our point is on the Y avis the abscissa »=0 and the co-ordinates of 
the origin 0 are both zero (0,0) 

From the above definitions we see at once how to plot, or locate, a point 
To plot the point (—4,3), since the abscissa x is negative and the ordinate y is 
positiv e we locate N on X'X, 4 units to the left of 0 At we erect a perpen- 
dicular upon which we locate the point (—4,3), 3 units above .V The s3mbol 
( —4,3) represents a particular case of the general s3'mbol {x,y) and is accordingl3 
plotted as a particular point as just shown If instead of the pair or relations 
evpressed by two equations x= —4, >'=3, we hav'e a single relation expressed 
by one equation, for example, y=x—2, we have y expressed as a function of x, 
whence by assigning to x different values, corresponding values of y are 
determined, and a set of points may be plotted where abscissas and ordinates 
are corresponding values of x and y respectively Thus, when x=0, y= —2, 
when v = l, y = —1, when x=2, y =0, w^hen x = 3, y = l, when x=4, y = 2 , . 

We may now plot the points .4(0,— 2), 5(1, — 1), C(2,0), £>(3,1), £(4,2), 
or as many more points as we may choose by giving x additional different 
Y values

As we plot larger and larger numbers of points closer and closer together, in 
the limit, if we take indefinitely many such points, m e approach a smooth line 
It can be proved that an equation of the type gi\en in this example, namely, 
where both variables are of the first order, always represents a straight line 
Such equations are called therefore hnear equations, as they represent stiaight 
lines 

The problem of linearity and non-linearity is of extreme importance, and 
we will return to it later on Here we are interested onlj in the definition and 
meaning of linearity of equations 

Let us consider next a simple equation of second degree, In assign- 

ing arbitrary values to x, we note that x® is always positive (by the rule of 
signs) whether x is positive or negative Hence, we may tabulate \ alues of x 
with the double sign ± meaning either -f- or — .

e see for each value of y we have two values for x which differ only in sign 
This means that W'e have points on two sides of the Y axis with numerically 
equal abscissas and, since for x=0, y =0, 
the beginning of our curve is at the origin 
of co-ordinates and the curv’e is symmet- 
rical with respect to the Y axis 

If we connect the points D', C, B', 

A', 0, A, B, C, D, with straight lines we 
have abroken line But if we choose smaller 
and smaller differences between the suc- 
cessive values of x, the broken line be- 
comes smoother and smoother, and, in 
the limit, as we take increasingly smaller 
steps, or, in other words, plot indefinitely 
larger numbers of points in one interval, we 
approach a smooth, or continuous curve ^ ^ ^ 

It must be noticed that in equation® 
of higher orders the ratio of changes in 
the function y to corresponding changes in the variable x vary from point to 
point, and so we have a ctirve instead of a straight line It is necessary to be- 
come quite clear on this point so we may better compare the two different types 
of equations as to the law of their growth 




586 VIII. ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


Let us write down in two columns the successive values for the two types 
of equations Let us take the equation the graph shown in the

The equation y = 2.ic involves the variables in the first degree and we see that 
the ratio of changes in the ordinates to corresponding changes in the abscissas 
remains constant (proportional) The triangles in Fig 5, are either equal or 
similar, which necessitates the equality of angles and so the line OABCD is 
of necessity a straight line In this case as x=0 gave us y=0 the line passes 
through the origin of co-ordinates 

The picture is entirely different in the case of the higher degree equation, 
■'^*1 

y=Y illustrated in Fig 4 From the table of values of the function v\e see 

that the value of the function increases increasingly more rapidly than the 
values of the independent variable and so the ordinates are not proportional to 
the abscissas If in Fig 4 we connect O with A, 0 with B, 0 with C, 0 with D, 
respectivelj , we see that the lines OA, OB, OC, and OD have different angles 
with the axis A'^Y, the respective triangles are not similar, and so there is no 
proportionalit> The lines OA, OB, OC, OD , do not represent a straight line 
as they have all different angles with the axis XX' and so the points A, B, 
C, D . , cannot he on a straight line but represent a broken line which, in the 
limit, when the points plotted become sufficiently near together, becomes a 
smooth and continuous curve 

The fact that equations in which the variables are only of the first degree, 
represent straight lines, and that equations of higher degrees represent curv ed 
lines IS very important, as will appear later on We must notice also that the 
problem of linearity is connected with proportionality 

These few simple notions concerning the use of co-ordinates will allow us 
to explain the geometrical meaning of the denvative and the differential.

Consider Pi and P2, (Fig 6) two points on the cur\e, y=f{x), referred to 
the axes OX and OY Drop perpendiculars Piil/i and P2-I/2 from Pi and P2

Pi draw the secant P1P2, the tangent to

represents Ay=y2—yi=/('«a)— /(■«!) the 
change in the function y

As P2 approaches Pi along the curve, the secant P1P2 rotates about Pi

PiQ But as P2 approaches Pi, Ax=X2 — Ai =i/iil/2 approaches zero or

finding of the slope of the graph of the function The increment Ay of the

From the above considerations we see that the differential calculus gives, 
by the application of some extremely simple structural principles, a method 
of analysis by which we can discover a tendency at a particular stage rather 
than the final outcome after a definite interval From such fundamental yet 
simple beginnings the whole calculus is dev’eloped Most of these developments 
are not needed for our purpose, but we will explain one specially important 
theorem The theorem in question is that the derivative of the sum of two 
functions is equal to the sum of their derivatives In symbols 

Dx{u + 11 ) +DxV.

Dx(u -l-») =Z>iM +DxV 

The sjmbol Dx means also that certain operations are to be performed 
upon our function, namely, to find its derivative When used in this sense it 
IS called an operator The operator Dx can be also written in its differential 

form as — and similarly for higher dcri\atives 
dx 


2 MAXIMA AND MINIMA 

It will be useful to have some applications of the differential calculus 
explained. 

If a function y=/(c) is continuous in an interval a<x<b and has larger 
(or smaller) values at some intermediate points than it has at or near the ends, 
then It has a maximum (or minimiini) at some point * =X 0 ) inside this inten al 
If Fig 7 represents the graph of the function, it is obvious that at the ma.\imum 
(or minimum) the tangent to the curve is parallel to the axis and therefore 
the slope of this tangent is zero As this slope is given by the derivative and 
the slope is zero we have a simple method of finding the maximum (or the 
minimum) of a function by equating the first derivative to zero, namely, 
DxV — 0 when .c = vo 

It IS useful to be able to discriminate between the maximum and the 
minimum of a function. Fig 7 shows that this can be done by finding means 
to discriminate between the two cases when our curv^e is concave upwards or 
concave downwards The slope of a curve for a particular v'alue of v 

is given by the value of Dxy, cor- 
responding to that value of x If 
the value Dxy is positive, y increases 
as X increases, and the curve 
slopes up as we move to the right, 
if the value of Dxy is negative, 
y decreases as v increases, and 
the curve slopes down as we move 
to the right 

If we consider the curve y=/(v) which has its concave side turned 
upward (Fig 8), the slope of the curve itself is a function of v, tan a=f'(v) 
If we consider a variable point P on a curve y =/(x), together with the tangent 
to the curve P, as following the curv e in the direction of increasing values of v, 
the curve is concave upward whenever the slope is increasing algebraically. 


Y

SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 589 


that IS when Dx tan a = 0 In other words, the curve is concave upwards for 
those values of x for which Dx tan a is positive, or since tan a=Dxy for those 
values of v for which Dx tan a = DiiD^y) —Dx^y \ 
is positive. Similarly a curve is concave down- 
wards for those values of x for which Dx tan a 
=Dx{Dxy) =Dx^y is negative. These results 
can be expressed thus 

A curve y=/(v) is concave upward when 
Dx^y>0, or, in words, when the second de- 
rivative is positive, and the curve is concave 
downward when the second derivative is 
negative, or, in symbols, when D^^yKQ. q 

From Fig. 7, we see that for a maximum 
we must have our tangent parallel to the Jf'Jf 
axis and our curve concave dow awards, hence for these conditions the first deriva- 
tive [Dzy]x=xa =0i and the second derivative [Z>i®y]t=ii) <0 For a minimum the 
first derivative must again be zero and the second dcnv aliv e positiv e, vv hence 
the concave side of the curve is turned upwards It should be noticed that 
the problems of maxima and minima play an extremely important structural 
psycho-logical and semantic role in our lives All theories, somehow, are built 
on some minimum or maximum principle involving evaluations which are 
fundamental factors of all semantic reactions. In daily life we apply these 
structural and semantic notions continually In science this tendency made 
Its appearance quite early The problem of maxima and minima was treated 
seriously as far back as the second century b c In the eighteenth century 
Maupertuis formulated a ‘supreme law of nature', that in all natural processes 
the ‘action’ (energy multiplied by ‘time’) must be a iniminum Euler and 
Lagrange gave an exact basis and form to this principle, and finally Hamilton, 
in 1834, established this principle structurally as a variational principle, known 
as the hamiltonian principle, which appears to be of extreme generality and 
usefulness It facilitates the deiivation of the fundamental equations of 
mechanics, electrodynamics and electron theory It has also survived, in a 
generalized form, the einsteinian revolution, for it contains nothing whatever 
which would connect it with a definite co-ordinate sj stem , it inv olv cs onlj pure 
numbers and so is invariant to all transformations It is structurally one of the 
most important invariants ascribed to nature, being independent of the sy stems 
of reference of the observ ers 

It is very desirable that this problem should be investigated further from 
the structural psycho-logical semantic and neurological point of view, as the 
very foundations of human psycho-logics are fundamentally connected with 
such a principle, which itself is an invariant in human psycho-logics 

Its importance is still increasing, and the hamiltonian principle plays a 
most remarkable role in all the newest advances of science Any reader need 
only look attentively at his daily life to realize that there too this principle 
plays a predominant role.

3. CURVATURE 

In modern scientific literature we hear often the fundamental term ‘cun-a- 
ture’ menboned, and a few words about it will not be amiss. If we take two 
perpendicular lines X'OX and OY and select on OF a number of points A, 

B, C,D , further and further aw ay from 0 
V* and describe arcs of circles w ith these points as 

0 centres with radii ^10, BO, CO, DO . . respecmelj 

Fig. 9, we find each successive arc flatter and 

c 0 

\ c' / closer to the line X'X than its predecessor. In 

\\ y ^ X f /y/ other words, the larger the radius of our circle. 

^ the flatter its arc is In the limit as the radius 

^ 0 ^ of the circle becomes indefinitely lar^e, the arc 

^ approaches a straight line by intuition and b> 

definition We notice also that the cur\ature 
of each circle is uniform, that is, one-talued at eieiy point, but that when we 
pass from one circle to another of different radius, the curvature changes 

If we consider a curve and two points on it, H/i and Jl/j, fFig 101 and 
draw two tangents at these points, then the angle between these two tangents 
will depend on two factors, the sharpness of the cur\ e and the distance between 

the points Mi and .l/j If we take the 
/ / points near enough and designate the 
//' length of the arc benveen them by Ar. 

Ay the angle between the two tangents 

by Afl, then the limiting \a!ue of the 
y y ratio AS,' As, as J/j approaches -l/i, 

\ becomes dBfds, and is a measure of the 

Ml 1 rate of change of the direction of the 

/ tangent at M, as M motes along the 

Fig 10 cune Let us designate the rate at 

which the tangent turns where the 
point descnbes the curve with unit velocitj- as the curvature, or k =±.d6/ds, 
but as ^ IS essentially a positive number or zero we accept only the absolute 
value of this ratio To find d8/ds we notice that tan 6=dy/d\ 

or fl=tan“*— =tan“' /, whence d6=-^ — = — ■

But ^ =— where ds —'Z{dx)^ + {dy)^ 1 +y'-dx 


whence k=-

The reciprocal of the curv'ature is called the radius of curt ature The radius 
of curvature of a circle is its radius. The curvature of a curve is metisured by 
the radius of the osculating circle, that arcle which fits the curve the most 
closely in the neighbourhood of our point. 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 591 


4 VELOCITY 

Until now we ha\e treated our independent variables as any quantity 
but there are many problems where the independent variable represents 'time' 
For instance, if we travel by railroad the distance increases as ‘time’ increases, 
plants and animals grow with ‘time’. By the aierage velocity with iiliich a 
given point moves for a gi^ en length of ‘time’ ^ e mean the distance s tra\ ersed 
divided by the ‘time’ elapsed If, for instance, a tram makes 5 miles m 10 
minutes we say that its average velocity is 30 miles per hour, or, in s>mbols 

Velocity, o=- In this case we were considering uniform velocity, but very 

often we have to deal vvnth velocities which arc not uniform and which might 
be increasing or decreasing In such a case we can describe the velocity 
approximately at any given moment if we take a short interval of ‘time’ 
immediately after the moment in question and take the average velocity for 
this short interval 


For instance, the distance a stone falls is according to the law, s = 16 We 
want to find how fast it is going after /i seconds when = 16 and a short 
interval after we have, let us say, sj = 16 Obviously the average velocity for 

the interval k—h is ^ — ~ feet per second If we take fi = l, ii = 16, and the 
h — h 

difference fj— fi=01 of a second then 43 = 16 < 2 ' = 16x1 21 =19 36 and 


42-41 
ii —ii 


>36-16 3 36 

= =33 6 ft per second 

n 4 /I 4 * 


If we take the interval of ‘time’ smaller, for instance, l/lOO of a second 


we would have — — ^=32 2 feet per second, and if we take the intervals as 
k-h 

1/1000 of a second the average velocity would be 32 0 feet per second We see 
that we could determine the speed of the stone at any instant with any degree 
of accuracy by direct calculation, but this is not necessary If we regard the 
interval k—h as an increment of the variable t, that is as Af, and 43— ji=As 
which represents the increment of the distance considered as a function of 
the ‘time’ we would have the average velocity =As/At As At approaches 
zero in the limit, the average velocity approaches a limit and this limit is the 
velocity V at the instant fi, or in symbols 

»= Iim — = — In words, the velocity of a 

at^At dt 

point is the 'time' derivative of the space traveled 

If the velocity is not uniform, the rate at which the velocity is increasing 

dv 

is called the acceleration and may be written as o =— , but as we hav e already 

dt 

In words, the acceleration is the second 
derivative of the distance with respect to ‘time’. 


seen dv is itself d\

592 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


In the above notes we have not attempted to give the reader more than 
some structural and methodological notions, and what amount really to short 
structural explanations of definitions which will be useful later on The reader 
can find many excellent books which give all the additional information he 
may want 

Section C On the integral calculus 

So far, we have been studying a method by which to find the variation of 
a given function corresponding to an indefinitely small variation of our variable 
We saw that the rale of change of our function was given by the first derivative, 
which in turn was also a function (usually different) of our independent variable 
and so could itself xary and have a rate of change, and so give us a second 
derivati\ e , . 

And now we must explain briefly the inverse problem, namelj', given the 
derivative to find the function In symbols, gi\en u=DxU, find U 

The function U is called the integral of u with respect to *, or, in symbols, 
U = J" udK 

To integrate a function /(v) is to find a function F{y) which when dif- 
ferentiated gives again the function /(v) with which we started As in this 
work we are not interested in computations, but only in the structural, 
methodological, and semantic aspects, the interse problem of differentiation, 
namely, integration, is less important for us here, and I will explain only a 
single example We have already differentiated the function y = 2.\® — r -|-5 and 
found Its dernative dy/dx=6\^ — 1 Just as the dcritative of the sum of a 
number of functions is equal to the sum of their derivatn es, a similar rule holds 
for the integrals, namely, that the integral of the sum of a number ol functions 
IS equal to the sum of their integrals Hence we can take in our example onlt 
the first term of our equation In sjmbols =6v'', in words, the deri\a- 

tive of 2x^ IS 

In a problem in integration we would ha^e 6v“ given and we would ha^e 
to find the original function from w'hich was obtained by differentiation 
In our case the solution is already given, namely, J'6x^d\=2x^ * In general 

the solution of problems of integration is largel) 
dependent on the ingenuity of the sober, al- 
though we hat e a number of standard formulae 
and methods The geometrical meaning of in- 
tegration IS much more interesting for us and 
we will give a short explanation of it 

If we consider the curve given by an equa- 
tion y=/(r) and the area bounded by the A 
axis, the two ordinates whose abscissas are v = a 
and x=b and the curve, we may find the area 
as follows 



*The constant of integration is omitted so as not to confuse the reader 



SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 593 


If we select an arbitrary -value x=ai:i for which y=yi=f(.Xi), denoting the 
corresponding value of the area A by Ai (Fig 11) and give to \i an increment 
Ax, then the area A i would receive the increment AA We can approximate 
by the help of two rectangles, one of height 3 'i=/(xi), the other of height 
yi =y\ +Ay =/(t 2 ) =/(*! LAt) 

We see that AA is larger than the smaller rectangle In symbols 
yiAx <AA <(yi+Ay)Ax, 

hence yi< — <(yi+Ay) 

Ai: 

As we pass to the limit and let Ax approach zero, we ha\e 

lim That is, DxA=yi=f(xi) when X'=\i, which means that' the 


ordinate of the curve at any point is equal to the .v deri\ ative of the area at 
that point In general, B^A =y, and hence, A ’=J'ydx 

The consideration of what is called the definite integral is still more 
instructive Let us take the curve in Fig 12 represented by an equation y =/(x) 
and a pair of ordinates vi hich intersect the X avis at the points t = i o and v =Ji„ 
Let us divide the interval x'oiin into n 
equal parts and erect ordinates at each 
point of division Let us construct a 
set of pairs of rectangles with these 
ordinates as we constructed the single 
pair of rectangles in Fig 11 By inspec- 
tion of the figure we see that the area 
under the curve is slightly greater than 
the sum of the areas of the included rect- 
angles and slightly less than the sum of 
the areas of the including rectangles When v is allowed to inciease without 
limit the sum of the areas of either set of these rectangles approaches the area 
bounded by the curve, the X axis, and the end ordinates In sjmbols, the 
area of the first rectangle beneath the curve is /(vo)Av, where Av denotes 



■^ 1 —^ 0 =— — — The area of the second rectangle is /(vi)Av , 


«-l 


these areas is/(a:o)Aa:-f-/(vi)Av-(- -|-/(x„_i)Av = y] fMAx

If we allow n to increase without limit we have the area under the curve 
A = Inn [/(vo)A\ +/(xi)Ax+ +/(v„-t)Ax] = lim J^/(x)Ax

X=Xff 

=fKx)dx = = -F(xo) 

In words, the above formula indicates the fundamental process of the integral 
calculus, namely Let f(x) be a continuous function of x throughout the 
interval If we divide this interval into n equal parts by the 

points a: = -Vo, V], . , v,., and form the sum/(vi))Av-t-/{a:i)A\--h -l-/(jc„_i)Ar,

594 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


as ■fte let n increase without limit, this sum wull approach a limit, which can be 
found by integrating the function /(v), that is, by hnding the function F(v) of 
which /(*) is the den\ ati\ e, and by taking the integral between the limits 
X =xo and x = v-„, that is, by taking the difference between F(x„) and F(xo) 

It must be noticed that in our first example, the case of the indefinite 
integral, we considered integration as the in\erse of differentiation, in the 
second example, we considered the definite integral as the limit of a sum 

The symbol of the integral, St had its origin in the letter 5 from the latin 
word ‘summa’, the integral being historically understood as the definite 
integral, or the limit of a sum 

Section D Further applications 

1 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION 

When we have more than one independent variable, for example, two, 
we have to become acquainted with w'hat is called partial differentiation 
This process is important, as in practice we usuallj' deal with several independent 
variables It presents \ery little that is new from a structural and method- 
ological point of view, but we give it here, simply to explain the meaning of 
the term, as the reader ma> find it used in other works 

If we have a function z of two independent xanables x and y, z=/(x,y) 
which geometrically represents a surface, we may differentiate with respect to 
one of the variables, let us say x, and hold the other t anable y fast, that is, 
treat it as a constant In this way we should then ha\e a partial demative 
of 3 with respect to x Similarly, if we treat x as a constant and differentiate 
in respect to y, we should ha\e the partial deniatiie of z with respect to y 
The above definitions give us the rules for partial differentiation — that is, 
following the ordinary rules, considering each \ anable indixidually and treating 
all the other variables as constant 

The notation for partial derivatives is similar to the ones explained before, 
except that the lower case letter d is replaced by the script form 3 or a subscript 
IS used to indicate the x anable with respect to which the differentiation is

2 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 


A natural development of the invention of the calculus vas the introduction 
of differential equations Differential equations differ from the ordinary 
equations of mathematics in that in addition to variables and constants they 
contain also derivatives of one or more of the variables involved Differential 
equations are of extreme importance, and arise in many problems Newton 
solved his first differential equation in 1676 by the use of an infinite series, 
eleven years after his discovery of the calculus in 1665 Leibnitz sohed his 
first differential equation in 1693, the year in which Newton first published 
his results From this date on, progress in the development and application 
of differential equations was very rapid, and today the subject of differential 
equations occupies in the general field of mathematics a central position from 
which important and useful lines of development flow in many different 
directions 

To integrate or solve a differential equation means, analytically, to find 
all the functions which satisfy the equation In gcometrj', it means to find all 
the curves which have the property expressed by the equation In mechanics 
It means to find all the motions that may possibly result from a given set of 
forces , The degree of the differential equation is defined as the degree of the 
derivative of the highest order which enters the equation The order of the 
differential equations is the order of the highest derivative it contains. 

Equations in x and y, of the first degree in y and its derivatives with respect 
to X, y', y" , are called linear equations The mam equations of phj sics are 
linear differential equations of the second order, since y, the primitiv e function, 
y', the first derivativ'e, and y", the second derivative, appear only in the first 


degree 


(Fy dx 

For instance the equation — r+ni— + 023 '

or y" +aiy' +aiy=X, 


w^hen X represents a function of v alone is such an equation It is linear, or of 
the first degree, because the second derivative, y", appears only to the first 
degree It is of the second order because that is the highest order derivative 
in the equation As we may recall, the derivative of a function gives us the 
rate of change of the function when vve give successive values to the independent 
variable When we study the rate of change of the rate of change of our function, 
we study the rate of change of the first derivativ'e w'hich expresses the rate of 
change of the function, whence we obtain the derivative of the second order, 
and so on If vve equate our derivatives to zero, or choose a value of the variable 
for which our derivative becomes zero, the rate of change of our function 



596 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEIMATICS 


becomes zero I n other words, the value of our f unction is momentarily constant, 
it has a stationary \alue. 

Quite naturally, differential equations which mtolve denvatives intohe 
implicitly and explicitly the whole fundamental structural framework of the 
calculus as explained in this chapter by expressing the ‘rate of change’ of some 
natural process If the rate of change is zero, it might express some ‘natural 
law', or some uniformity as found in nature In other words, differential 
equations express differential laws, which in turn express the momentary' ten- 
dencies of processes xvhose outcomes are gi\cn by the process of integration 
From what has already been said here, it is oIimous that differential 
equations and the differential laws which they express are of extreme structural 
importance. They formulate not only the uniformities and tendencies found 
in nature, but also of necessity somehow invoke causality' Besides which, 
they are also in accord with the phy'sical structure and function of the ner^ ous 
system. We shall return to this most important subject in the next chapter, 
in xthich we shall analyse the physical significance and aspects of w'hat ha= 
been explained here 

3 METHODS OF APPROXIMATION 

In discussing the above fundamental notions of the calculus we considered 
a portion AB, of the curve given by the equation y=/(v), (Fig 13 ) and two 
points on this curve Pi with co-ordinates (xi, yi) and P2 with co-ordinates 

(v2, >’2) moving along the curve, the 
B secant, or chord, P1P2 rotates about Pi, 

Its length steadily diminishing, and in 
the limit as the length of the chord P1P2 
tends toward zero, the slope of the se- 
cant approaches the slope of the tangent 
PiT We saw that the slope of this tan- 
gent was given by the value of the first 
derivative of the function w'hich repre- 
sented the curve We W'ere try ing to get 
some knowledge of the direction of our 
Fic 13 curve at a given point by considering 

the slope of a stratghl hne of smaller and 
smaller length When we studied the curvature of our curve W'e considered the 
rate of change of the slope of our tangent and so, by the aid of a second deriv a- 
tiv e, we found the curvature In this case we approximated our curv e to a circle 
of radius equal to the radius of curvature of the curv e at a given point 

In attempting to determine the length of a portion of our curve a point 
cannot be regarded as a piece of the curve but only as marking a position on it 
For the purpose of determining the length of an arc it is convenient to replace 
each small element of the arc by its chord, a lineal element By definition the 
length of an arc of a curve is the limit, if such limit exists, toward which the 




SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 597 


sum of the lengths of the chords of its small subdivisions tends as the number 
of chords increases indefinitely and then indiMdual lengths all approach zero 
uniformly For example, the circumference of a circle is the limit approached 
by the perimeter of an inscribed polygon as the number of its sides increases 
indefinitely, the lengths of the individual sides all approaching zero 

Similarly the length of a cun-e may be approximated by the sum of the 
lengths of segments of tangents at successive arbitrarily chosen points, merely 
by choosing the points nearer and nearer together For example, the circum- 
ference of a circle is the limit approached by the perimeter of a circumscribed 
polygon as the number of its sides increases indefinitely, the lengths of the 
individual sides all approaching zero In either case, a point on a curv c taken 
with a vanishingly small portion of the tangent to the cur\e at that point may 
be called the lineal element of the cun e. 

The abox e definitions apply equally well in either two or three dimensions 
The lineal element in two dimensions may be defined by three co-ordinates x, 
y, p, of which X and y are the co-ordinates of the point through which the lineal 
element passes and p is the slope of the element This slope, as we already 
know, is to be found by differentiation, and is given by the formula p =dyfd\ 
In geometrical problems which relate the slope of a tangent to that of other 
lines, it is not the tangent that is of real importance but the lineal element 
From this point of view a curve is made up of infinite numbers of vanishinglj 
small lineal elements which are tangent to it, which is the point of view of the 
differential calculus Or the curve is composed of infinite numbers of \ amshingly 
small chords which are the sides of an inscribed polygon, which is the point of 
view of the integral calculus 

Obviously, in the limit, both points of view are equualent, although as a 
matter of convenience they may be different In any case, it must be obvious 
to the reader that using straight lines instead of pieces of a curve, or using as 
closer approximations arcs of circles, facilitates our study of the curves, indeed 
renders such study possible at all, and in practice we can carry our woik to any 
degree of approximation we choose But in theoretical work we require pre- 
cision, hence we think in terms of infinite numbers of v,inishmgly small steps 
The differential and integral calculus supply the only perfect technique for 
these processes of analysis and synthesis 

4 PERIODIC FUNCTIONS AND WAVES 

We have already said that the most important relations of physics are 
represented by linear differential equations of the second order It is important 
to know the connection of these equations with the general theory of waves 
or oscillations 

If on a circle of unit radius, as shown in Fig 14, we take several points 
Pi, Pi, Pi, Pi, and connect these points by straight lines with the centre O, 
we get angles XOPi, XOPi , In trigonometry we define certain functions of 
these angles and a unit of measurement For our purpose we will only define 
the so-called sine and cosine, as we have already met the definition of tangent

tan 6= The angles XOPi, XOPi , may be speafied b> the ratios 

}S\P\/OP\, MzPilOPi , respectively each of which ratios has a definite v alue 
This ratio in any case is called the Jine of the angle, and is written in abbreviated 
form sin 0. If the radius of our circle is taken as unity then simply J/iPi = 
sin Z. PiOMi=sin0, since OPi = l. The ratio OMi/OPi is called the cosme 
of the angle XOPu and is wntten cos 0

Fio 14 


There are two units of measurement of angles In ordinary', or sexagesimal, 
measure, the unit angle is the degree, 1/360 of the entire angle about a point, 
1/180 of a straight angle, or 1/90 of a right angle The degree is div ided into 
60 equal parts called minutes The minute is divided into 60 parts called 
seconds. In circular measure the unit angle is the radian, the angle at the 
centre of a circle whose arc is equal to the radius of the circle This angle is 
a constant vv hcther the circle be large or small, due to the fact that the cir- 
cumferences of circles var> as their radii, and, in one circle, angles at the centre 
are proportional to their arcs The constant ratio of the circumference of the 
circle to Its radius is given b> the number ir=3 14159 . , this number being 

‘incommensurable’ with unity As the length of the circumference of a circle 
with radius R, is 2 ir R we see that the entire angle about the centre, vv'hich in 
degrees is 360, is m radians 2 ir , that a straight angle equals 180 degrees or ir 


radians, and that a right angle equals 90 degrees or - radians 
180 ^ 

Thus 1 radian = =57‘’17'44" 806 which, asitdependson thevalue 

ir 

of ir is itself an ‘irrational’ number The ‘incommensurability’ of the radian 
with right and straight angles makes its practical use inconvenient One of 
the main uses of the radian is in theory as it introduces a marked simplification 
in that the ratio of the sine of an indefinitely small angle to the angle itself is 1, 
when the angle is measured in radians In other words, the equivalence of an 
indefinitely small arc and chord becomes apparent numencally when the angle 
and sine are expressed m one unit

From Fig 14 and from this table, it follows that the values of the trigono- 
metric functions are equal for the angles 0 and 27r, or in the language of degrees, 
for the angles 0° and 360° We see also from Fig 14 that the angle XOPi, or 
any other angle, has one measure as expressed by its trigonometric functions 
if we add to it 360° or 2ir radians 

The structural importance of the trigonometric functions in analysis lies 
in the fact that they are the simplest singly penoiltc functions and are therefore 
adapted for the representation of undulations As we have already seen the 
sine and cosine have the single real period 2ir, which means that they are not 
altered in value by the addition of 2ir to the \ariable The tangent has the 
period ir 

Besides the three functions defined above, we usually define three others, 
the secant, the cosecant and the cotangent as reciprocals respecti\ely of the 
cosine, the sine, and the tangent These last three we may disregard in our 
present discussion 

Let us consider the function y=&in x, and construct the curve which this 
equation represents If we draw a circle of unit radius, Fig 14, the ordinates 
corresponding to the different angles XOPi, XOPi , give the values of y, 
while the angles measured in radians, gne the corresponding values of the 
abscissa x. 

Plotting corresponding values of x and y as thus obtained in Fig 14 we 
get in Fig 15 the partial graph of the function y = sin x Proceeding again 
around our circle in Fig 14, that is, adding 360° or 2ir, to each of our angles, 
hence to their abscissas of the curve in Fig IS, we add to the graph a second 
complete wave We may thus proceed either forward or backward obtaining 
as many complete waves, or undulations, as we please, as in Fig 16 

The curve represented by y=cos3r is obtained in like manner and is quite

To differentiate sin x we give to x the arbitrary values xi, and Xi+Ax and 
compute for y the corresponding values yi = sin Xi and yi -1-Ay = sin (.ri-l-Axl

Subtracting yi from yi+Ay, we have Ay = sin (xi+Av)— sin Ai Dhiding

To express the meaning of the above geometrically we may lake a circle 
of unit radius and construct the angles xi and (xi+Ax), (Fig 18). Then 
il/iPi=sin xi, JlfiiPj = sin (xj+Ax), QF 2 =sin (xi+Ax)— sm xi=Ay, and arc 
PiP2=ZjPiP2=A*:. 

The limit approached by the ratio AyfAx—QPifPiPi as Pj— f Pi, or 
as Ax-4 0, is by previous definitions the sine of the angle MtPiPi, since tn the 
limit the arc P 1 P 2 becomes a straight line, the hypotenuse of the right triangle 
P 1 QP 2 , which IS similar to the right triangle PiJ/iO, whence angle ZilAPjPi = Zvi,

It may be easily and similarly shown 
that cos X = — sinx Our mam 
interest is in the second derixative 
We see that the derivative of sin x is 
cos X, and that the derivative of 
cos X is —sin X 

Differentiating again we obtain 
the second derivative of sin x as 
—sin X, and the second derivative of 
cos X as —cos X 

The sine and cosine and their 
linear combinations are the only func- 
tions which when differentiated twice 
give us the second differential coef- 


ficient equal and of opposite sign to the original function.

SEMANTICS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 601 


In physics we deal with many processes which are structurally periodic, which 
means that a definite physical condition constantly recurs after equal intervals 
of ‘time’. The number of seconds or fractions of seconds within which the 
process runs its course is called the period VVe know already that the simplest 
periodic functions are sine and cosine functions of the type 

sin (v+2Mir) =sin x, and 

cos (\:+2jMr) =cos v, where n may ha\e any in- 
tegral value Furthermore we have already seen that the first dcri\ati\es, 
therefore all derivatives of such functions are likewise simple sine and cosine 
functions In particular, the second derivatives of the sine and cosine functions 
are likewise sine and cosine functions taken with the opposite algebraic sign. 

If we express the variability of a process as a function of ‘time’, that is, 
by an equation of the form S = F(t), thenm a periodic process, F(h+7iT) =F(/i), 
where T is the period and n any integer. If the process repeats itself, as in a 
periodic process, we must have 


dF 

dl 

l=l\+nT 

dF 

dt 

and 

t=ti 

(PF 

dt^ 

(=li+nr 

d^F 

dP 


but, as we have already seen, the sine and cosine functions satisfy these 
conditions. 


A process which can be described 1 




IS called a hatmomc vtbrahon or, a ‘pure sine vibration’, or simply a ‘vibration’ 
or ‘oscillation’. The constant A, which represents the maMnium value of the 
displacement on either side, is called the amplitude The period T is called 
the ‘time of vibration’, its reciprocal value which gi\ es the number of v ibrations 
in a unit of ‘time’ is called the vibration number or frequency. 

As the second derivatives of sine and cosine functions are equal to the 
original functions taken with the opposite signs, we can describe harmonic 
vibrations by differential equations of the first degiee (linear) and of the second 
d~S (2^1 

order of the special type — - = —a-S, w'hcre 5 =A sin ' he), A representing 

dr T 

the amplitude, T the period, e the phase of the vibration The factor of propor- 
tionality a IS taken as the square of any arbitrary real quantity to indicate 
that the right-hand side must alwajs have the opposite sign to that of S 

The propagation of a v'lbration is called an advancing plane wave which 
has both velocity and direction, 

Fourier has shown that any given form of wave may be represented by 
the superposition of a series of sinc-waves, which gives sine-waves great 
theoretical and practical importance. 

In writing this chapter I had tvvo mam aims One was to briefly indicate 
the essential semantic factors involved in the differential methods The other, 
to make the general reader and even specialists who are not mathematicians 
acquainted with some terms and rudiments of method which will be necessary 
for further discussion. 



602 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEilATICS 


The differential methods invohe semantic factors essential for a ^4. -system, 
the OB-valued semantics of probability and for sanity and cannot be longer 
disregarded. 

The main pressing issues are twofold One, to formulate methods which 
w'ould impart the A semantic reactions of the calculus, w^hich need not invol\ e 
any technicalities, and can be imparted in the most elementary’ home or school 
education The other is to draw the attention of specialists to these semantic 
problems so that they will work them out 

An attempt to sohe the first issue has been undertaken in the present 
volume The second task will probably be accomplished in the not too 
distant future 

It is earnestly suggested to all scientists, professional men and teachers, 
who are not mathematicians, to become familiar with differential methods 
and so acquire the appropriate semantic reactions Experience, in many cases, 
has show n that this will assist them in acqumng semantic balance and ‘mental’ 
efficiency Teachers and physicians in particular, w'ould be greatly- helped in 
their efforts to tram children and patients in the A reactions The benefit 
is not in any ‘calculations' whatsoe\er, but in the method and the related 
psy cho-logical reactions 

There is an excellent, short, most elementary and amusing account of 
the calculus by Sylvanus P Thompson Calculus Made Easy (Macmillan) which, 
for the present, is all that is need«i for this purpose. 



CHAPTER XXXIII 


ON LINEARITY 


The conception of linear transformation thus plays the same part in 
affine geometry as congruence plays in general geometry, hence its funda- 
mental importance (547) Hermann weyl 

It IS instructive to compare the mathematical apparatus of quantum 
theory with that of the theory of relativity In both cases there is an ap- 
plication of the theory of linear algebras (215) w Heisenberg 

This "perturbation theory" is the complete counterpart of that of clas- 
sical mechanics, except that it is simpler because in undulatory mechanics 
we are always in the domain of linear relations (466) E schrodinger 

As a result of experimental research on association, in 1904, I was led 
to show the complexity of the factors governing evocation . . And I 

have often insisted since then on this essential idea, in opposition to the 
simple schema of linear associative connection. (4ii) henri heron 

We have already had several occasions to mention the ‘plus' or additive 
issues as connected with linearity This problem is of structural and linguistic 
as well as empirical and psycho-logical semantic importance. It is sufficient 
for our purpose at present that we should notice two facts, namely, (1) That 
in one dimension, linearity expresses the relation of proportionality, (2) That 
the problems of linearity are dependent on the relation of additivity 

The structural notion of additivity is of great antiquity. Being the 
simplest of such notions, it naturally originated very early m our history The 
earliest records show that the Babydonians and the Egyptians used the additive 
principle in their notation Our primitive ancestors, long before any records 
were written, had similar structural conditions present, open for investigation 
and reflection, that we hav e today That this was the case is not a mere guess 
Otherwise we would still be at their stage of development Some beginning 
had to be made somewhere There is little doubt that the men of remote 
antiquity presented many ty'pes of make-up, as we do today Some, for instance, 
vv'ere more cunous than others, some more inventive, some more reflective . , 
which, as we know today, is found even among animals These more gifted 
individuals were, as usual, the inventors, discoverers, and builders of systems 
and language of their period They could not long fail to recognize the fact 
that a stone and a stone, or a fruit and a fruit are different from one stone or 
one fruit. For instance, the two stones might have saved the early observ cr's 
life in defence, or the two fruits might have satisfied his hunger or thirst, where 
one would not have done so. An accumulation of objects was obviously some- 
how different from a single pbject As these problems were often of vital 
importance to their liv es, names for such accumulations of objects began to 
be invented, and one and one was called two, two and one was called three , . 
Number and mathematics were born as a structural semantic hfe-necessity

604 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


for a time-binding class of life They ■were an expression of the neurological 
structure and function and of the tcndcnc>' toward induction. 

In the beginmng, names and generalizauons -were made from the simplest 
brute facts of life, and our primitive ancestors did not realize, that these crude 
generalizations might not have a structural validity . which the>' seldom doubled 
that the> possessed, e\en as ve toda>, seldom doubt Those pnmiti\e 
saentists, (and we today differ \er> little from them), haMng produced lerms, 
objectified them, and began to speculate about them. Let us examine some 
examples of such primitive mathematical speculations. Addition, of course, 
by vhich we generate numbers . — one and one make two, two and one make 
three . , nas all-important They could not miss the simple fact that three 
Vi hich is equal to tvi o and one, bj definition, is more than two or one A primi- 
ti\e generalization, nameh, that the sum is ahiays more than the summands 
taken separately, was still further generalized to a postulate that a part is 
smaller than the whole This generalization has hampered mathematics almost 
up to our ow n day, and for manj" thousands of > ears it prevented the discov en 
of the notion of mathematical infiniU, which we have already discussed in 
Chapter XIV 

It must be noticed that such generalizations inv oh err. which are objecnv e 
and un-speakable If verbally formulated thej should have a structure similar 
to that of the facts, otherwise they are fanciful and v icious, because not properh 
formulated. When formulated they become public structural facts (s r arc- 
personal, individual, non-transmittable, and un-speakable) and so the\ ma> be 
criticized, improved, revised, rejected, All human histon' shows that the 
correct structural formulation of a problem is usually as good as the solution 
of it, because sooner or later a solution ahvavs follows a formulation. 

After many thousands of v ears — in fact, practically only the other daj' — it 
was found that these pnmitne generalizations were in general not valid 
Negative numbers were invented, and two plus minus-one was no mure 
three but one, 2+{ — i) = l The sum was no longer greater than its summands 
The usual tragedy takes place here also A few people know the facts, but the 
old primitive structural j r remain in some of these few, as well as m the great 
majority of us who did not ev en know the facts That such structural j r do 
not vanish quicklv, or generall>, is proven again and again throughout historv 
We see it very clearlj' in the problems of 'infinity', or £ geometries, or jV 
phjsics But the most pathetic sight is to see scientists who have rationalized 
the technique without a deeper re-education of their s r This is most clearlv 
seen in the case of man> writers on the foundations of mathematics, the Einstein 
theor>’ or on the new er quantum mechanics They feel m the old structural 
w a> , they rationalize in the new, hence their works are full of self-contradictions. 
Readers and students alike feel how' ‘difficult’ and messy the whole subject is. 
.Vs a matter of fact, the new theories are neither messy nor difficult They are 
really much simpler and easier than the old theories, provided our structural J i 
are purged of the primitive structural tendencies to which every one of us is 
heir When this semantic re-education of our structural feelings is accomplished 



ON LINEARITY 


605 


It IS the old that beromes ‘unthinkable’ and incomprehensible, because it gives 
such a structural mess. 

Something similar might be said about a feeling deep-rooted in all of us 
namely, the 'plus’ feeling In all the advances of science we struggle against it. 
For instance, the example of the green man-made leaf given prcMously shows 
clearly that man-made affairs may with some plausibility be considered as 
‘plus’ affairs, but not so with non-man-made natural lea\cs, which appear 
not as ‘plus', but functional affairs, where the greenness was structurally not 
added but happened, or became As a structural fact, the world around us is 
not a ‘plus’ affair, and requires a functional representation In chemistry, for 
instance, does hydrogen ‘plus' oxjgen produce water, H 2 O? If we mix the 
two gases, two parts of hydrogen with one of o\>gen we do not get water 
We must first pass a spark through the mixture, when an explosion occurs 
and the result becomes water, a new compound quite different from its elements 
or from a mere mixture of them Does one gallon of water and one gallon of 
alcohol make two gallons of a muxture? No, it makes less than two gallons 
Does light added to light make more light? Not always The phenomena of 
interference show clearly that light ‘added’ to light sometimes makes darkness 
Four atoms of hydrogen, of atomic weight 1 008, produce, under proper con- 
ditions, one atom of helium, not of atomic weight 4 032, but of atomic weight 4 
The 0 032 has somehow mysteriously vanished Such examples could be quoted 
endlessly. They show unmistakably that structurally this world is not a ‘plus’ 
affair, but that other than additn e principles must be looked for 

The struggle against this ‘plus’ feeling is quite eMdcnt, but often unsuc- 
cessful, in scientific literature Man ‘is’ an animal ‘plus’ something Life ‘is’ 
‘dead matter’, ‘plus’ some ‘vitalizing principle’, . In scientific literature we 
find curious expressions as for instance, 'It is impossible to express the conduct 
of a whole animal as the algebraic sum of the reflexes of its isolated segments’ , 
or, ‘The individual represents heredity plus environment’, or, ‘That the 
abstraction does not merely take aw'ay from a number of engram groups some 
components and combine the rest into one sum, but forms thereby a new psj'chic 
structure is self e\ ident and is in no way peculiar to the psyche Thus a clock 
work IS as little the mere sum of its little wheels as a human being is the sum 
of his cells and molecules’ , and later on, ‘to be exact the ego consists of the 
engrams of all our experiences plus the actual psjchism’ There is endlcsa 
material that might be quoted, but for our purpose these few samples w'lll 
suffice We do not give them with the purpose of citing authoritati\ e examples 
of the need of non-plus considerations Far from it We do it to emphasi/c 
the astounding fact that, although the best men in their fields ha\ e \ agucly felt 
this necessity, yet even they become a prey to this very old structural linguistic 
semantic tendency In all three cases quoted the authors were of the best 
we have. They have fought all their lives against the ‘plus’ tendency and 
methods, and yet, if they succeed in eliminating this tendency from one part 
of their subject, they plant it quite obviously somewhere else We see that 



606 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATFIEMATICS 


we are dealing here with an ingrained psycho-logical tenldency which can be 
remedied only by a fundamental, At structural, semanttic investigalion 

Let us analyse these quotations In the second cajse, we hear, after a 
successful attack on plus tendencies, a statement that the f individual represents 
heredity plus environment' Is this statement truei* Lat us take examples. 
There are certain fishes which are heliotropic and swim (toward the light, but 
if we change the temperature of the water they become ^egatively heliotropic 
and swim away from the light Is this most complex acti'v ity of the organism- 
as-a-whole a ‘plus env ironment' fact, or does the change of temperature produce 
some fundamental functional changes? When, for instance, a good mother rat, 
having been put on a different though still abundant diet, which is deprived 
of some minute amount of special vitamins, begins to eat her litters, is this 
again a ‘plus' reaction, or is it a most complex functional change of the 
organisra-as-a-vvhole^ Or when a human being, because he received in childhood 
an 'emotional' shock through outside events (action or language of parents, 
for instance) develops a functional disorder, or even a physical ailment, is this 
again a ‘plus environment' problem^ Or, when chickens fed on eggs laid bj 
hens kept without sunlight or violet rays, or which have only received sunlight 
through a glass window, develop rickets and soon die, though they do not 
do so when the glass windows are removed and the sunlight is allowed to 
operate directly upon the hens Is this again a 'plus environment' example’ 
One 'Smith' and one 'Smith' make two 'Smiths’, as far as theatre or railwav- 
tickets are concerned, but in life, under proper condinons, they form a family 
and very often many more than two 'Smiths’ come out of such 'addition' 
How about their work? Is it a mere sum? In the case of inventors who mav 
have been influenced by one or many men directly or indirectlj , do their inven- 
tions produce a sum of the work of as many men? Surely the steam engine or 
the dynamo produces more work than not only the inventors, but the series 
of other men who have been indirectly responsible for the inspiration of the 
inventors, could ev'er have produced So again it is not a 'plus' affair 

In the third case we see the author attacking the 'plus’ tendency on one 
page, and planting another 'plus’ a few pages further on, w hich implies at once 
some objectified additional entity In this respect it must be noticed that 
this additive tendency represents a partial and important structural and 
semantic mechanism of identification, and to deal successfully with it, vve must 
clear up the problem connected with the additive tendency 

The numberless and endless 'philosophical' volumes, for instance, which 
hav e been written about the 'body-soul' problems, show the tremendous struc- 
tural and semantic importance of the clearing up of this 'plus' versus 'non-plu'-' 
issue The reader may recall that the A, the E, and the jV systems have one 
underlying structural metaphysics The E systems deal with non-Iincar 
equations and with curved lines, of which the linear equation and the straiglii 
line, (one of zero curvature), are only particular cases And the general theorv 
of Einstein, which is the foundation of systems, also introduces non-linear 
equations Ought we to be surprised to find that a ^-system must also solve 



ON LINEARITY 


607 


this difficult structural and semantic problem of linearity versus non-linearitj , 
of additivity versus non-additivityi* 

Indeed the problems demanding our attention are extremely baffling and 
difficult Even in such a perfected science as physics, we have great difficulties 
in using non-linear equations, and are still at the stage where we solve few' 
equations other than linear ones To make any progress at all we must start 
with the simplest available problems in this field, namely, mathematical 
problems The mam point at this stage is not a solution of the problem but Us 
formulation When foimulated and brought to the attention of mankind, 
there is no doubt that it will be eventually solved. 

To better understand the additive principle, let us consider a group of 
elements, the individuals of which we denote by letters a, b, c, d , . Let us take 
two or more of these elements and produce a synthesis which results in a third 
or n-th entity Let this synthesis be of such a nature that the characteristics 
ascribed to the elements are also present in the resultant synthesis, in other 
words, let them have the so-called group characteristic. If our elements are, 
for instance, numbers, the new synthesis is also a number and belongs to the 
original group We must notice that the problem of order is important m the 
formulation of the additive principle If a and b are the two elements the 
sjnthesis of which we define, w'e must be clear that a first and b second, or 
b first and a second, must be recognized m the sj nthesis Let us assume also 
that only the two alternative orders a and b, or b and o, arc of importance m 
this case The commutative law asserts that a plus b is equal to b plus a, 
a+b =b+a, which means that the two piossible alternativ'e orders give equivalent 
results We must notice that this does not mean that order does not enter 
into this synthesis, in such a case the above mentioned commutative law would 
make no assertion at all It is of importance that order should be inv'olved in 
the synthesis It is a matter of indifference only as far as equivalence by a 
commutative law is concerned 

We should notice for our purpose that the synthesis has the 'same' charac- 
teristics as the elements had In other words, if we know the characteristics 
of the elements we know the characteristics of the result For instance, if the 
elements were numbers, the result will be a number, and no characteristic 
absent in the elements will appear in the result This predictability from the 
characteristics of the elements to those of the result is perhaps one of the most 
striking characteristic.' of additivity On the one hand, it allows us to foretell 
the future, on the other hand, it limits considerably the applicability of the 
additive principle It is obvious that when we combine elements, and the 
results hav'e new characteristics absent in the original elements, the new 
problems are structurall> no more of an additive character, and the synthesis 
must be different 

Only a few of the simplest entities in physics possess additive character- 
istics If we take, for instance, 'weight' or ‘length’ or 'time', we see that these 
units are additive One pound, or inch, or second, if added respectively to one 
pound, or inch, or second, gives us two pounds, or two inches, or two seconds 



608 VIII. ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


Not so, however, with temperature, or density, or many other derived magni- 
tudes, as we call them If we ha^e a body of temperature of one degree and 
combine it ivith another body of equal temperature the synthesis will not 
have a temperature of two degrees, (as in the case of weight), but of one degree 
This applies to density , t\vo bodies of density one each will not give us a body 
of density two, but of density one 

Before further analysis of the problems of linearity and additivity, it 
will be well to consider a few definitions 

If an entity u is changed into an entity v by some process, the change 
may be regarded as the result of an operation performed upon «, the operand, 
which has converted it into v If we denote the operation by/, then the result 
might be written as v =fu The symbol of the operation / is called the operator 
We are familiar with many such, indeed the symbols for all mathematical 
operations may be treated as operators So for instance the symbol y/ 
indicates the operation of extracting the square root If we deal with a range 
of values for a variable x, what we have defined as the function sj mbol/(v) may 
be treated as an operator whose operation on x may be indicated by the 
symbol fx The operation of differentiation may be s>mbolized by D, the result 
of whose operation on the variable u, Du is the derivative of it The sign of 

a 

the definite integral f may be taken as indicating an operation which con- 
h 

\ erts a function into a number , . 

It IS important to know that many of the rules of algebra and arithmetic 
when defined in this way, give rise to a calculus of operations The fundamental 
notion in such a calculus is that of a product If u is operated upon by / 
the result v is indicated by /«, or symbolically, v =fu If v in turn is operated 
upon by g the result w is indicated by gv, or symbolically, w=gv= gfu, whence 
the operation gf which converts u directly into w is called the product of / 
and g If this operation is repeated several times in succession the usual notation 
of powers is used, for instance ff=f, . Not applying the operator at 

all, which we would denote by /“, leaves u unchanged, which we indicate 
symbolically by the equation /“«= it The operator/" is equivalent to multi- 
plication by 1. /'’ = !, whence/" may be called the idem operator. We see also 
that the law of indices holds; namely, the/™ X/" =/"+". 

For our purpose we will analjse only one special case, namely, where we 
have It, V and u+v as operands, and such an operator./, that f(_ii+v) =fu+fv 
Expressed in words, this means that the operator applied to the sum of the 
two operands gives a result equal to the sum of the results of operating upon 
each operand separately Such a special operator is called a linear, or dis- 
tributive, operator. 

In terms of functions we would have /(x-l-y) =/(v)-f-/(y) which may be 
called a functional equation It has been proved that such a functional equation 
has one type of solutions, namely, when / is equivalent to a multiplication 
by a constant, orfx =cx. This fact is of great importance for us Many problems 
in science are stated in terms of variation. For purposes of analysis a statement 



ON LINEARITY 


609 


that varies as y' is written y=kx, where k is called a factor of proportionality, 
which enables iis to convert a statement of variation into an equation If 
y varies inversely as x, we write y=^(l/-v:) or y=k/x A multiplication by a 
constant thus introduces a relation of proportionality, hence the importance of 
proportionality in a world where constants are present 

It must also be noticed that the two fundamental operations of the calculus 
are linear without being equivalent to multiplication by a constant These 
are ‘the derivative of the sum is the sum of the derivatives', that is, 
D{u+v) =Du+Dv, and ‘the integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals’, 
.that is J'{u+v)dx = J'tidx+J'vdx But as the fundamental notion of the 
calculus IS to substitute for a given function a linear function, in other words, 
to deal with curves as the limits of vanishingly small straight lines, this linearity 
underlies structurally all fundamental assumptions of the calculus, and one 
might say with VVeyl that 'one here uses the exceedingly fruitful mathematical 
device of making a problem linear by reverting to infinitely small quantities’ * 
A vector is defined roughly as a line-segment which has a definite direction 
and magnitude, and any quantity which can be represented by such a segment 
IS defined as a vector quantity 

The addition of vectors is defined by the law of the parallelogram, as in 
the case of two forces It should be noticed that because of this definition the 
sum of two vectors differs in general from the arithmetical sum of the lengths, 
and only collinear, or parallel vectors obey the arithmetical summation law 
The introduction by definition of mathematical entities which obey dif- 
ferent laws from the usual arithmetical laws is an important structural and 
methodological innovation It gives us the useful precedent of defining our 
operations to suit our needs The vector calculus accepted as the definition of 
the sum of two vectors the law established experimentally in phjsics for the 
sum of two forces, and so the vector calculus from the beginning was struc- 
turally a particularly useful language in physics Only since Einstein has the 
value and importance of the vector calculus for physics become generally 
appreciated. 

If we have two vectors, a and b, start- 
ing from a common origin 0 and complete 
the parallelogram as in Fig 1, then the di- 
agonal of the parallelogram will be the re- 
quired sum, a H-b, by dejfniiw» 0 

If we choose two co-inibal vectors of 
unit length, one on the X axis, and the other 
on the Y axis, and call them i and j, we can 
always represent any vector x as the sum of Fig 1 

two vectors, one of which is the projection 

of X on the X axis, and the other the projection of x on the Y axis (See Fig. 2 ) 
Let us call these vectors x' and x" respectively Then x=x'-t- x", by definition 
But x' differs from 1 in length only, hence it can be obtained by multiplying 1 by 
39 




610 VIII. ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


an appropriate number, say a Similarly, can be obtained from j by multi- 
plying j by ft, and so, in symbols, x'=ai, x"=ftj, and x=ni-bftj All vectors 

of the plane can be obtained from i and j m this 
form The numbers a and 6 are called com- 
ponents of X 

Now that we know how to express a % ector 
in terms of its components, namely, x=ci-l-ftj, 
let us consider a vector function /(x) which satis- 
fies the equation /(x-l-y) =/(x)+/(y) We may 
take ai =x and 6j =y and x -fy =z then we ha\'e 
/(z) =/(x -hy) =/(oi) -|-/(ftj) But since a and ft 
are numbers, we have/(ai) =af(i), and likewise, 
/(ftj) =ft/(j). so that/(z) =<j/(i) -|-ft/(i) But/(i) is itself a vector and therefore 
expressible in the form a'l-l-ft'j, and, /(j) =ci-l-dj Hence, /(z) =a(a'i-t-6'j) -f- 
ft(fH-rfj) =(aa'-|-ftc)i-|-(aft'-|-ft<f)j In general, the components are the co- 
efficients accompanying i and j, and so we have the components of /(z) =/(x-t-y) 
in terms of the components of z, and we see how the components of a vector 
are changed into the components of the linear vector function of the vector 

In general terms, a continuous vector function of a vector is said to be 
a hnear vector function when the function of the sum of any two vectors is 
the sum of the functions of those vectors, that is, the function / is linear if 
/(ri-l-r 2 )=/(ri)-|-/(r 2 ), whence, if a, be any positive or negative number and 
if / be a hnear function then the function of a times r is a times the function 
of r, /(or) =a/(r) 

Linear vector operators are also defined b> a similar equation, namelj , 
Z,(a-l-b) =Z,a-fI,b 

Let us recapitulate If we take the functional equation /(v -hy) =/(v) -h/fy), 
which might be used as a definition of linearity, and which is based on additivity, 
and take v = y = 1, then we hav e /(I -|-1) =/(2) and also /(I) -|-/(1) =2/(1) , and 
so our original equation becomes by substitution /(2)=2/(l) It is obvious 
that the original equation, /(v -(-y) =/(v) -t-/(y) , is the source of indefinitely many 
such relations for particular numbers For instance, /(3) =/(2 -|-1) =/(2) -1-/(1) , 
but, in accordance with what we obtained before, /(2)=2/(l), so that 
/(3) =2/(1) -|-/(1) =3/(1), and in general, /(v) =t/'(1) So, if we have an equation 
/(v -hy) =/(t) -t-/(y) for numbers, vve know that we can obtain the value of this 
function for any * if we know it for 1 If we denote the function of 1, which 
IS a constant, by /(l)=fe, we have the general form of the function which 
satisfied /(t -hy) =/(v) -t-/(y) expressed by f[x) =kx In words, a functional 
equation of the above type, namely, a function of the sum equal to the sum 
of the functions, has only one possible type of solution, namely, when / is 
equivalent to a multiplication by a constant, or, /(v) =kx But this last means 
proportionality The values of the function are proportional to the arguments 
(vaiiablcs) In fact, let us consider two arguments, that is, two values of the 
independent variables x and y We have, as shown before, f{x) =kx and

(>') =ky. Dividing the first by the second, we obtain f(x)/}{y)=kx/ky=x/y 
or, in another form, /(.v)/x-=/(y)/}’=^ 

Let us consider an example We know from elementary geometry that if 
we take an angle a and diaw parallels which cut the sides at AA', BB', CC, 
DD' , the corresponding intercepts are propor- 
tional In general, the lengths of the segments on 
the left side are not equal, neither are they equal 
to the segments on the right side If we designate 
the segment AB as x and BCasy, the correspond- 
ing segments A'B' and B'C' we may designate as 
f{x) and/(y), respectively, which means function 
of v and function of y A'B' —f(x), B'C'=f(,y) 

But the aboie intercepts are proportional, which 
AB BC AB+BC 
A'B'~B'C'~A'B'+B'C' 


means that - 



We easily see from Fig 3, that AB+BC=AC = x+y, and A'B'+B'C' =A'C' 
and so A'C' on the one hand is f(AQ =fix+y) and on the other hand it is 
f(.x) +f(y) and therefore /(v -Hy) =f(x) +f(y) We could multiply examples by 
taking relations between central angles in a circle and arcs of its circumference 
In fact, any problem of measure in E geometry could be used as an example 

In our development we started with definite additive natural tendencies, 
not only in our highest, yet undeveloped, mathematics, which we call our 
daily and scientific language, but also m our lowest, but perfected, language 
which we call mathematics In this perfected language the notion of additivity 
IS connected with linearity, and the methods of approximation are also founded 
on additiMty and linearity. 

Yet the world around us in its more fundamental structural aspects is not 
additive, and for adjustment we must find means of passing from additixc 
tendencies and formulations to non-additivc tendencies and formulations 
hlodern mathematics has developed these methods, and modern physics is 
beginning to apply them Let us repeat the importance of linear functions 
implies the importance of 'straight' lines The> are important on two counts 
first, because they are simpler than all other curies, so that naturally we want 
to study them before we study other curves, such as, for instance, circles or 
the other conic sections in elementary geometry, and secondly, because all 
curves can be approximated by straight lines This point is ver>' important, 
as approximation is the most powerful method we have of handling com- 
plicated situations 

There are two methods of approximating a curve in the vicinity of a point 
If we are interested in the immediate vicinity of a point we approximate the 
curve by its tangent, as the tangent approximates the curve m the vicinity of 
a point better than any other straight line If we want to decrease the error 
which we make in this approximation, we have only to decrease the vicinity 
in which we consider it If we do not want to restrict ourselves to a small 



612 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


neighbourhood we have to use more complicated methods of approximation 
We inscribe into the cur\c a broken line which consists of segments of straight 
lines The beginnings of the study of curves consist in reducing the study of 
curves to (1) The study of straight lines connected with the curves' tangents, 
which IS the point of departure of the differential calculus, and (2) The study 
of the inscribed broken lines, which is the point of departure of the integral 
calculus. 

Now cun'es represent only the simplest dependences In other cases we 
have more complex kinds of functions, for instance, vector functions, but m 
every case we have linear functions, the simplest of then type, and other 
functions are studied by approximating them in one way or another by linear 
functions In using the term ‘function’, we mean not merely numerical functions 
but also operators, which are to the ordinary functions what ordinary functions 
are to numbers A general definition of linearity can be connected with that 
of proportionality in the following manner If two variables are proportional, 
one to another, then to the sum of any values of the first corresponds the sum 
of the corresponding values of the second 

The simplest part of any field is the consideration of linear, additive 
questions, linear equations (equations of first degree in algebra), linear dif- 
ferential equations, linear integral equations, linear matrices, linear operators , 
But sooner or later we come to the more difficult and more interesting non-linear 
problems Perhaps the mam importance of the General Theory of Einstein 
lies in the fact that the equations of physics become non-Unear Now, although 
non-lincar equations can be approximated by linear equations, the character 
of a world determined by non-linear equations must be entirely different from 
a world determined by linear equations In a linear world electrons would not 
repel each other but would travel independently of each other, and there could 
be no relation between the charges of different electrons But we know that 
electrons do repel each other, and attract protons, and that their charges are 
equal In physics, if a system can be described by linear differential equations, 
the causal trains started by different events propagate themselves without 
interference, with simple addition of effects 

The properties of systems which can be described by linear differential 
equations have, as we have already seen, the property of additivity This means 
that the result of the effects of a number of elements is the sum of the effects 
separately, and no new effects will appear in the aggregate which were not 
present in the elements In such a universe there is ‘continuity’, fields are 
superposable, wave disturbances are additive, ‘energy’ and ‘mass’ are inde- 
structible , . In such a universe we can have two-valued causality, as causal 
trains started by different events propagate themselves without interference, 
and with simple addition of effects, and the present can be analysed backwards 
into the sum of elementary events, that is, a two-valued causal analysis is 
possible 

If our equations are not linear, the effects are not additive and a two- 
valued causal analysis is not possible. 



ON LINEARITY 


613 


The joint effect of two causes working together is not the sum of their 
effects separately®, and we need oo-valucd causality 

Analytically, if we have linear differential equations and we have one 
solution yi =/(^) and another solution = F{x) then their sum is also a solution , 
namely, y3=fM+F{\) If the differential equations are non-lmcar and if 
yi=/W and y2 = F{x) are two solutions, thcn/Cal+Ht) is not a solution 

Linear problems and linear equations play a very important stniituial 
role in science and theie is little doubt that linear equations prcpondciatc 
enormously, although many fundamental e\ents cannot be described by suth 
equations. A universe which can be described by linear differential equations 
of the second order has definite structural characteristics — m the mam in 
rough accord with observation As such differential equations give us the 
tendency of a process, we may use them to desenbe large-scale phenomena by 
integration, or the statistical phenomena of great numbeis 

Unfortunately, the study of non-lmcar problems is structurally very 
difficult and largely a problem of the future 

There is one very important point w'hich W'e should not miss We know' 
already that there is a fundamental difference between different oiders of 
abstractions Physical abstractions ha\e always charactcnstits left out, and 
our higher order abstractions are further remoied from life, but they hate all 
characteristics included The problem of sanity being a problem of adjustment, 
we must somehow coi relate these abstractions in which characteristics are 
left out with those which include all characteristics, and so mud proceed by 
approximations Mathematical methods, particularly those of the differential 
and integral calculus, hace ecohed the best technique of approximation in 
existence today, which, as we haic seen, is stiictly connected with linearity 
or additivity. 

A similar urge which prompted us in the expression of our additiie 
tendencies and methods in the structure of language, has led to the production 
of the calculus For organisms which abstract in so numeious and such diffeient 
orders, the methods of the calculus aie therefore fundamental psycho-logical 
devices, conditioning sanity' 

In conclusion, w'e should notice livo quite iinpoilant facts One of these 
is that the nervous system, being in a state of nenous tension, cannot struc- 
turally be a simple additive affair in all its functions, a fact which c\ cry one 
of us has experienced Too many stimulations dull, or abolish, or change 
reaction in an enormous variety' of w'ays Pieron, as a result of experimenting 
in association, has not only shoivn the comjilcxity of these processes, but also 
reaches the conclusion that the associati\e connections aie non-lmcai ’ The 
other most important point is that structurally the term ‘and’ implies addition 
When we confuse orders of abstractions or levels of analysis, the ‘and’ additice 
implications falsify the issues Thus for instance two atoms of hydrogen and 
one atom of oxy'gen and a spark produce water. The second ‘and’, at least, 
is used illegitimately, as it applies to an entirely different level (the spark) 
from that of the atoms. Linguistically we introduced additive implications. 



614 VIII OX THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEIMATICS 


while empincallj we are dealing with most complex non-additive, non-lmear 
higher-degree functions When we confuse orders of abstractions, as we all 
do, the ‘and’ is bound to introduce structurally false implications, which it is 
very difficult to avoid — the more so since these semantic problems are generallj 
entirely neglected. 



CHAPTER XXXIV 


ON GEOMETRY 

At the same time it not be forgotten that the physical reality of 
geometry can not be put in evidence with full clarity unless there is an 
abstract theory also . Thus, for example, w hile the term electron may 
have more than one physical meaning, it is by no means such a protean 
object as a point or a triangle (2S9) Oswald \eblen 

Euclidean space is simply a group (4i7) hexri poimc vre 

It IS onl> in Euclidean "graxitationless’ geometry that mtegrability 
obtains issi) hermvnxwe\l 

The fundamental fact of Euclidean geometiy is that the square of the 
distance between two points is a quadratic form of the relative co-ordinates 
of the two points {Pythagoras’ Theorem) But if we look upon this law as 
being slnctly valid only for the case when these two points are infinitely near, 
we enter the domain of Riemann’s geometry (547) herm \.nx weyl

it determines Thus, the principle of transference of distances or lengths which 
IS the basis of metrical geometiy , carries with it a principle of transference of 
directum, in other words, an affine relationship is inherent m metrical 

space (547) HERM-tNMWEYL 

But before dealing with the brain, it is well to distinguish a second char- 
acteristic of nervous organization which renders it an organization in 
levels (411) HENRY PIGEON 


Section A Introductory. 

The mam metrical rule in geometry' is the familiar Pythagorean theorem 
In 1933 this rule is no longer considered as generally valid outside of the euclid- 
ean sy stem, as its proof depends on the doubtful postulate of parallels. It is 
considered as an empirical generalization in which the relatit e error deinaases 
when the distances become smaller Indeed the small element of length, ds, 
gn en by the py thagorean rule is considered con- 
\enient and reliable m our exploration of the 
world 

The Pythagorean rule states that in any right 
triangle, ABC, the square of the side opposite the 
nght angle (the h\ potenuse) is equal to the sum 
of the squares of the two other sides (the legs). 

In sy mbols, AB^=ACP+BC^ If we build squares 
on all three sides of the triangle ABC and denote 
the areas of the squares by C', A', and B' then 
we hat e C = A' +B'. 

The above rule is also the main metrical 
rule for co-ordinate geometry, which gives us 
the length of the line segment joining any two 
points. Consider, for example, two points m two dimensions, P i and P*, whose

co-ordinates referred to a pair of axes in the plane are (\i, yi) and (vj, ys) B> 
drawing the lines P^Q and PiQ parallel to the X and Y axes respectively, a right 
triangle P1QP2 is formed whose legs PiQ and PiQ are equal to X2 — -vi and yz — yi 
respectit elj , whence P1P2, the hypot enuse of the right tria ngle, or the distance 
s between the points, is equal to or f='N/(a,2 — Vi)® 4 -(y 2 -yi)' 
If we pass to indefinitely small quantities and choose to deal with differentials 
we have ds- =d\.^ -f-dy^ where dx = X2 —Xi and dy =y2 — j'l Usually the physicists 
treat their differentials as very small quantities and we may do likewise, although 
this IS not precisely what a differential represents 

In three dimensions similar formulae appear, namely, = x® +y® -I-2- for 
the distance of a point from the origin and s=V^(.'e2— ■'^i)^+(y2— yi)^+(22— -1)’ 

for the distance between two points Pi (\i, yi, ei) 
and P2 (^2, y2, 22), and also ds^=dx^+dy-+d::-, 
for the indefinitesimally small distance between 
two points 

In referring our geometrical entities to co- 
ordinate axes, or frames of reference, as the\ are 
called, we aie interested m the properties of our 
geometrical entities and not in the accidental char- 
acteristics of our frames of reference, or the acciden- 
tal characteristics of the form of representation w e 
are using. Mathematicians discovered long ago 
that the form of representation is not of indiffer- 
ence to the results they obtain Speaking roughly 
they have discot cred that in one form of representation, they obtained character- 
istics a, b, c, d, VI, n, in another form, characteristics o, 6 , c, d, p, q, and 
in still another form, characteristics a, b, c, d, s, t , In cases where direct 
inspection was possible they find by checking up predicted characteristics, that 
such characteristics as o, b, c, d in our example actuall> belong to the subject of 
our analysis, w hereas the characteristics m, 11, p, q, s, t, . , do not 

belong to our subject at all, but vary from one form to another depending on the 
form of representation Such facts make mathematicians distinguish between 
characteristics which are intrinsic, which actually belong to the subject inde- 
pendently of the form of representation, and those which are extrnme, which 
do not belong to the subject, but are accidental and tary with the foim of 
representation we happen to use 

If wo mix intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics we ha\e a structurally 
distorted knowledge of our subject Ob^ lously w e are interested in methods by 
w Inch these two types of characteristics can be separated and distinguished 
Such methods are found in what we call the transformation of co-ordinates, 
which means the passing from one form of representation to another, from one 
system of co-ordinates to another which corresponds to translation from one 
language to another Obviously those characteristics which are intrinsic to our 
subject are and must be independent of the accidental selection of our form of

leprcsentation, and therefore should remain unchanged when we pass from one 
frame of reference to another Any characteristic which is changed by such a 
transformation of our s> stems of reference is clearly an extrinsic characteristic 
injected b> the form of representation and not belonging to our subject, and so 
the transformation of co-ordinates is precisely the test we need and use. 

Let us take for instance the line segment P 1 P 2 , as in Fig 3 We may refer 
PiPi to a system 0, or to a sjstem O' Obviously the length of the line PiPt 
is independent of the axes of reference used, and the formula for the length of 
a line is not altered, although the values for the x’s and y’s are different in the 
tw'o systems In other words, the sum of the squares of the differences of the 
co-ordinates remains inv ariant In s> mbols, 

i =v (vis-xi)H(y2-yi)- {^i'-xiT+W-yi'Y 
Such expressions, howev er, as xi -f xj or 
yivj , are not characteristics of our 
subject but characteristics of the par- 
ticular frame of reference used, and so 
are mostlj of no interest to us 

In such an elementary example 
as given here we are directl> ac- 
quainted with our entities, and so 
we can inspect them directly and 
check for intrinsic and extrinsic char- 
acteristics But when we deal with 
geometries of more than three di- 
mensions, such checking becomes very' 
difficult, if at all possible, and so new 
methods hav e to be inv ented 

If we vv ish to eliminate the unit by which w'e measure our lines, this can 
be done bj using a relation called a ratio Let us, for instance, select 3 points 
A, B, C, and write the invanant formulae for t he distance AB and AC in the 
form V (x 2 -\i)--}-(y 2 -r,)^ and V (v3-vi)--f-(y3-3'i)® 


Y 



then the ratio 


R = 


V (v2-ri)--l-0’2-3’i)^ 


y/ (vi— vi)'-|-f3'3— yi)^ 

IS independent of our unit of measurement If. for instance, this ratio jR = 1, we 
conclude that AB=AC, a characteristic which belongs to our lines and which 
IS independent not only of our system of reference but also of the unit which we have 
used 


A great step forward in the formulauon of methods which lead to invariant 
and intrinsic formulations was made in the invention of what is called the vector 
calculus and its extension in the modern tensor calculus A few explanations of 
this pnnciple will be of interest 

vector is roughlj a directed segment of a straight line on which we dis- 
tinguish the initial and the terminal points A vector has thus magnitude and 
direction. In practice wre deal with two kinds of entities; some are purely 



618 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


numerical, establishing a specific, mostly asymmetrical, relation and have no 
direction, as for instance, mass, density, temperature, energy, electrical charge, 
population, mortality , These quantities which do not involve direction arc 
called scalar quantities 

Such quantities as velocity, acceleration, electric current, stresses, flow of 
heat or fluids , which involve not only magnitude but also a definite direction, 
are called vector quantities, and have given rise to a special calculus called the 
vector calculus 

The invention of the vector calculus was a most revolutionary and bene- 
ficial structural and methodological step It was originated independently by 
Hamilton and Grassmann The benefits of this method are manifold, but we 
are interested mainly in but two of them. The first is that vector equations 
are simpler and fewer in number than co-ordinate equations The second, and 
most important, is that the language of vectors is independent of choice of axes, 
and of frames of reference It is naturally invariant for any transformations of 
axes If axes are needed we can easily and simply introduce them, but we al- 
wa> s have means to discriminate between intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics 
The modern tensor calculus which irfade the general theory of Einstein possible 
IS simply an extension of the vector calculus 

The above methodological and structural remarks are of fundamental 
semantic importance to us in all our affairs Human life and affairs are never 
free from linguistic issues Their role is similar to that ol mathematics, that is 
to say, a form of representation gives us not only the characteristics which are 
intrinsic in our subject, but also introduces extrinsic characteristics which do 
not belong to the subject of our analysis but are due to the particular language 
we use and its stiiicture The analysis of these linguistic issues is much belated 
and extremely difficult because of the structural complexity of our language 
These issues were discovered first in mathematics because of its clear-cut struc- 
tural simplicity, and it is important that we should be aware of such new and 
unexpected fundamental semantic problems We will not enlarge upon this 
phase of the problem here, except to mention that the whole of the present 
work, which uses a different language, of a diffeient structure, already shows 
the usefulness of the new method Sometimes we discover new characteristics, 
and sometimes we are led to emphasize characteristics which are known but 
have not yet been sufficiently analysed 

To carry our linguistic analogy further, we may take, for instance, the 
statement, ‘knowledge is useful’ We could translate this statement into any 
other language and it would preserve its meaning. But if we make the state- 
ment, ‘knowledge is a word which has six consonants and three vowels’, such a 
statement may be false when translated into another language Mathematics 
being a language, has difficulties similar to ordinary language, but in mathemat- 
ics It IS often much more difficult to separate from other statements those which 
are purely about the language used The so-called tensor calculus attempts to 
perform this last task. 



ON GEOMETRY 


619 


The tensor calculus is an extension of the xector calculus, which has be- 
come famous since Einstein 1 1 gn cs us formulations independen t of any special 
frame of reference In using it we are automatically prexented from ascribing 
to the events around us charactenstics vhich do not belong to them The 
tensor equations give us absolute formulations, absolute being understood as 
relatixe, no matter to what Obviously the only language fit to express the 
‘laws of nature' should be independent of the particular point of view or lan- 
guage of some obserx'er It should gixe us formulations in\ariant for any and 
all s> stems of reference, although we might use preferred s> stems of reference, 
as, for instance, the principal axes of an ellipse, uithout any danger The 
reader should not miss the point that such an ideal should be considered as the 
highest ideal in science. It is the mathematical species of a theory of ‘unnersal 
agreement' The above 50i(nrfs simple and innocent, but, when actuallv' applied, 
plays havoc with most of our old 'universal laws' These laws do not survive 
this important and uniquely valid test, and so become mere local gossip instead 
of being the 'universal laws’ that they claim to be W e will return to the struc- 
tural problem of inv anant formulations later At present we must explain =ome 
other simple considerations 

On any surface we need two numbers or ‘co-ordinates' to specify the posi- 
tion of a point, and so a surface is called a two-dimensional manifold Points 
in three-dimensional manifolds require three numbers, points in four-dimensional 
manifolds four numbers, and similarly for any number of dimensions. 

For our purpose, it is enough to speak in two dimensions, as our statements 
can easily be generalized to any number of dimensions If we want to localize 
a point on a surface it is enough to divide the surface into meshes by any two 
line-sj stems which cross each other Bj labeling the lines of each svstem with 
consecutive numbers, two numbers, one from each sjstem, wnll specify a par- 
ticular mesh. If the meshes are small enough we w'lll be able to locate any 
point accurately 

These specifying labels or numbers require that we know what kind of 
mesh w'e are using Distances between points are independent of mesh systems. 

For the above reasons it is important to have more data about the mesh 
system we are using which means that we have formulae which express the 
distance between two points, which is independent of the mesh systems, in 
terms of the mesh system. 

We have already seen, in our study of the differential calculus, that, as a 
rule, it is simpler to deal with very short distances, and that it is easy to pass 
to larger distances by the process of integration As yet we have used only 
plane rectangular sy-stems of meshes in our illustrations, but this restriction is 
not necessary If we use oblique co-ordinates (Fig 4j, the formula for the ele- 
mental distance is ds- =dxi-- 2 kd\id\ 2 +d\ 2 -, where A=cosine of the angle 
beuveen the lines of partition 

The polar co-ordinates (Fig. S) of the point P are the distance r=OP , of 
the point from the origin 0, and the angle, 0 = ZJCOP, between the hne OP 



620 VIII. ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


and the axis OX The formula for the elemental distance in polar co-ordinates 
IS ds^ =dr^ +r^d6^ 

Fig 6 shows the co-ordinates frequently used by geographers, namely, 
geographic longitude and latitude, where the distance ds^=dfi^+cos^PdK^. 



Fig 4 



Fig S 



It should be noticed that these formulae for different systems of co-ordinates 
are different To make it still more obvious to ocular inspection, we will tabulate 
them in one lettering, thus 

ds^ =d\i^ +dxi‘ for rectangular systems 

ds^ =dKi^ +xi^dxt^ for polar systems ... 

di- =iici*— 2 for oblique systems ^ 

ds- =dv]* -t-cos^jCidt2® for latitude and longitude systems ^ 

It must be noticed that the values for the variables are not equal in these 
different equations It is not necessary for the reader to know in detail how 
these formulae are obtained, but it is necessary to see that they are different, 
that they hai e different structure The numbers of different co-ordinate systems 
we can use are infinite, but in practice n e use only a few well-known types 
There are also definite and simple formulae for passing from one system of 
co-ordinates to another 

We should not assume that in practice we always know what system of 
co-ordinates we are employing For instance, before we learned that our earth 
IS ‘round’, we did not know whether in our measurements we were employing 
the flat co-ordinates of a plane or spherical co-ordinates We made some 
measurements and then we had to discover what kind of formulae would fit 
these measurements 

To find out what kind of co-ordinate system we are using, we select two 
points, let us say (*1, -1:2) and (.vi-t-dv, a-2-l-dv) very close together, make our 
measurements of ds, and then test our ds to find which formula it fits If we 
find for instance that our ds^ is always equal to dx^ -^dx^ we may assume for 
simplicity and our purpose that our co-ordinate system is plane and rectangular 
If our measurements fit any of the first three formulae ( 1 ), we may assume 
for simplicity and our purpose, that we are dealing with a plane surface, as 
each of these systems belongs to the plane But if we find that the actual 
measurements of ds^ are such that they never fit these first three formulae, 
but only the fourth one, we know, that our surface is not plane but curved

like a sphere Tit as we may, we shall be unable to build on a plane any 
co-ordinate system which will fit the last formula Thus we arn\e at an im- 
portant conclusion, nameh , that from measurements we have a structural hint 
as to the kind of •world we are in 

Section B On the notion of the ‘Internal Theory of Surfaces’ 

Let us imagine some two-dimensional beings confined to their surface 
and unable to have a look at that surface from our third dimension For them 
our third dimension would be ‘unthinkable’, and therefore the surface of a 
sphere like our earth which is cur\ed m the third dimension would also be 
'unthinkable' or ‘bejond them’. Should the% conduct some measurements in 
their 'world’ and find that these measurements did not fit any of the first three 
formulae but onlj the fourth, they would ha\e to reconstruct radically their 
'world conception’ and conclude that their world was a spherical surface Our 
own situation does not differ radically from the situation of the inhabitants 
of this hypothetical tw'o-dimensional world 

If we find oursehes so restricted as not to know' whether we are finalli 
dealing with a flat or spherical surface, we can select a point 0 and with a 
definite radius R describe from this point a circle ABC Then we can measure 
the circumference of this circle. Now we know from geometr>' that in the plane 
the arcumference of the circle L-2rR 
where R is the radius of the circle and 
IT =3 1415 ... If our surface is flat 
(ABCD), our measurement of L and R 
will satisfy the relation expressed in 
the formula But if the surface is 
curved, our R = 0.4 will be larger than 
i?'=.40', and we shall find that our -r 
IS not 3 1415 , but smaller We 

see once more that the metrical proper- 
ties of our world throw some light on Us 
structural character. 

We should notice also that the cun aturc of a tw’o- 
dimensional surface is in the third dimenaion and that 
it is the means of gixing us data about the surface 
without our leaxnng the surface and going into a third 
dimension. It is easy to conxince oneself about these 
facts by taking 12 wires or strings of equal length and

622 VIII. ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


The formulae (1) have been generalized to 

ds- = Eiidvi^ +2gi^xidxi +gi-idxi (2) 

for two dimensions and to 

ds^ =gndxi^+g22dxi‘+g33d\i^+gudxi‘+2gi2dxidv2 
+2gi3dxidx3+2gudxidxi+2g23dx2dx3+2g2idx2dxi+2g3idx3dxt ^ ' 

for four dimensions It is easy to see that ds^ =dxi^ +dx 2 ^ is obtained from (2) bi 
taking gii = 1 , gi 2 =0 and I 22 = 1 This applies to formula (3) out of which ii e 
can have any of the other formulae by equating some of the g's to zeros, or to 
one or to other values Formula (3) is called ‘the generalized Pythagorean rule’, 
of which the ordinary form as given previously is only a particular case W’e 
see, by comparing the formulae (1) with (2) and (3), that these g’s are not 
equal for different systems of co-ordinates, and that they are factors in measure- 
determination which represent the geometry of the surface considered It is 
customary to write the above formulae in an abbreviated form thus, 
ds^ = yi / . gmndxmdxn , where we give to tn and n the values 1, 2, 3, 4, or, 
(wi, n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and where the symbol means summation 

We will now evplain briefly the above generalizations and the meaning 
of the g’s given in the evpressions 

In the beginning of the nineteenth century the mathematician Gauss 
formulated the vtternal theory of surfaces without reference to the plenum in 
which they are embedded This theory perhaps is and will remain a model on 
which all theories should be built He introduced also a new kind of co-ordinates 
which have become of paramount importance, and which since Einstein are 
called gaussian co-ordinates Gauss investigated the theory of surfaces, which 
are in general curved, embedded m three-dimensional ’space’ In 1854 the 
great mathematician Rieraann generalized the two-dimensional gaussian theory 
to a continuous manifold of any number of dimensions Historically, both 
Gauss and Riemann can be considered as the precursors of Einstein. 

Let us imagine a surveyor to have the task of mapping a thickly W'ooded 
hilly region Because of the conditions of his work, he can not use optical 
instruments, and he has no ‘straight lines’ to deal with So euclidean geometry 
will, in general, not be applicable to the region as a whole. It can be assumed, 
however, that euclidean geometry may be applied to very small regions which 

can be considered flat What we know already 
about the differential and integral calculus shows 
us that such approximations, when taken on a 
very small scale, are perfectly reliable and jus- 
tifiable 

The surveyor would lay out on his ground a 
network of smoothly curving lines, in two fami- 
lies, an X family and a Y family. (Fig. 9 ) All 
the curves of the X family would intersect all 
the curves of the Y family but no X curve 
would intersect another X curve, nor a Y curve 
another Y curve

Let us take the sur\e\or’s netvi'ork and label the cur\'es by consecutive 
numbers in each familj The essential point is that these numbers, (let us call 
them the X and V numbers) do not represent either lengths, or angles or other 
measurable quantibes, but are simph labels for the curves, much as when 
we label streets by numbers 

But such numbering does not lead us far We must introduce some measure 
relations We have at our disposal a measunng chain and the arhitmry meshes 
of the network which we have introduced. The next step is to measure the 
small meshes one alter another and plot them on our map. When this is done 
we have a complete map si.milar in structure to our region. Because of the 
smallness of the meshes we can consider them as small parallelograms, and 
such parallelograms can be defined by the lengths of two adjacent sides and 
one angle. 

We ma> however, proceed differently, as shown on Fig. 10 

Let us select one mesh, for instance the one bounded by the curves, 3 and 4, 
and by the curves 7 and 8 Let us consider a point P within the mesh, and 
let us denote its distance from the point O (x=3, y = 7) by r This distance 
could be directly measured Let us draw from the 
point P parallels to our mesh lines and label the 
intersections with mesh lines by A and B, respec- 
tively. Let us also draw PC perpendicular to the 
a axis 

The points .<1 and B then also ha\e numbers 
or labels or gaussian co-ordinates m our network. 

The co-ordinate of .4 may be determined by 
measuring the side of the parallelogram on which 
A lies and the distance of A from 0 We can 
regard the relation called the ratio of these two Fio. 10 

lengths as the increase of the x co-ordinate of 

A towards 0. We shall denote this increase it-elf by x, choosing 0 as the origin 
of the gaussian co-c'dirates. Similarh we determine the gaussian co-ordinate 
of y of B as the ratio m which B cuts the corresponding side We see that 
these two ratio i which for brevity wc call x and y are the co-ordmates of 
our point P. 

As X and y are ratios they of cour'-e do not give us the lengths of OA and 
OB but the lengths are gi\en, tor example by av, and by, where a and h are 
definite numbers, to be found hy further measurements. If we move the point 
P about, its gaussian co-ordinates change but the number'! a and h w'hich gixe 
the ratio of the gaussian co-ordinatts to the true lengths remain unckan^e/i. 

We find the length t which is the distance of the point P from O, from 
the right triangle OPC h> thf pyrhagorean rule s- = 0P~==0Cr+CP'. But 
0C=0A+AC and therefo'e by substituting and squaring we have 
s-=A 0'+20A AC^A(P-‘rCP^. From the right triangle APC we have 
A(P-\-CF^ =AP^, whence substituting again we have s^ =0A*-l-20.(4 AC+AP^. 
But OA =ax, AP=0B =by, and aa AC is the projection of AP =6y, it also has 




624 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


a. fixed ratio to it, whence we may put AC=cy, and so we obtain the important 
formula 5 ® =a-\.^+2utxy+b~y^, in which a, b, c are ratios gn cn by fixed numbers 
Usually this formula is represented differently, a} is designated by gu, ac by gu, 
and 6* by g 22 ; whence our formula becomes =guv'^+ 2 gi 2 vy+g 22 j'* in which 
the numbers 11, 12 and 22 are simply ordering labels without quantitati\ e values, 
mere subscripts, labels, indices , which indicate that the different g's ha\c 
different values We see that the above formula is the one which was given 
prev'iously by (2) 

The g's with different labels serve just as sides or angles for the determina- 
tion of the actual sizes of the parallelograms and we call them the factors of 
the measure determination They may have different values from mesh to 
mesh, but if they are known for ev^ery mesh, then, by the last formula, the 
true distance of an arbitrary point P, within an arbitrary mesh from the origin 
can be calculated ^ 

The procedure by which we can locate any point on the surface is simple 
If our point P IS between the two curves x=3 and ji=4 we can draw nine 
curves between these two curves and label them 3,1, 3,2, ; 3,9 If P now 

lies between curves 3,1 and 3,2 we can draw nine curves between these two 
curves and label them 3,11, 3,12, , 3,19 , We could do similarly with the 

y curv'cs and in this way we would succeed in assigning to any point as accurate 
a pair of numerical labels as we pleased, and so finally have the gaussian 
co-ordinates of any point We used nine curv’es simply to get the very con- 
venient decimal method of labeling The cartesian co-ordinate systems which 
we use in plane geometry obviously represent only special cases of gaussian 
systems 

As we have already seen, our g's are ratios, and so represent numbers Such 
numbers may be regarded as tensors of zero rank for convenience of the mathe- 
matical treatment, and the quantities gn, giy, gyy, may be treated as com- 
ponents of a tensor Since this tensor determines the measure relations in any 
particular region, it is called the metric fundamental tensor Its value must be 
given for the region in which we want to make our calculations It determines 
the full geometry of the surface in a given region, and, conversely, we can 
also determine the fundamental tensor in a given region from measurements 
made in that region, without any previous knowledge of how our curved sur- 
face IS embedded in ‘space’ at the place in question The fundamental tensor 
in general varies continuously from place to place, and so ev'ery geometric 
manifold may be regarded as the field of its metric fundamental tensor 

Purely mathematical investigations show that the fundamental tensor 
defines a number called the ‘Riemann scalar’, which is completely independent 
of the co-ordinate system and leads to the definition of the curvature tensor, 
which can be connected with the 'matter tensor' ® 

The main importance of the introduction of such arbitrary curv'es is to 
produce formulae for the surfaces which remain unaltered for a change of the 
gaussian co-ordinates — in other words, which remain invariant This was 
achieved by the introduction of the relations called ratios which are pure

626 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


The problem is to determine whether a particular kind of space-time is 
possible We must im estigate the different g's hich give us different kinds 
of space-time, and not those which distinguish different kinds of mesh systems 
in one space-time This means that our formulae must not be altered in any 
way if we change the mesh sjstem 

The abo\e condition makes an extraordinarily simple test of laws that 
have been or may be suggested Among others, Newton’s law is swept away 
How this happens can be shown in turn dimensions 

If in one mesh s>stem (x,y) we hax-e ds-^giidv^+lgizdydy+gi^dy^, and in 
another system (x',y') ds‘‘=gnd-<.'-^2gnd\'dy'->rgiidy-, one law must be 
satisfied if the unaccented letters are replaced by accented letters Let us 
suppose that the law gu =^22 is assumed We change the mesh sjstem, for 
instance, by spacing the y lines twice as far apart, that is, we take y' =y/2 and 
keep x' =x Then ds-=gnd\.‘^+2g\^xdy-\-g2^y^=giidx'^+4tgiidx'dy' +Ag 2 'idy''^. 
We see that g\\ = gw and gn = His. Whence if gn is taken equal to g 22 , gii' 
cannot be equal to £ 22 ’ 

A few examples would coniince us that it is extremely easy to change a 
formula entirely by the mere change of mesh systems It seems unnecessary 
to emphasize the fact that ‘universal law's’, to be ‘universal’, should not depend 
structurally to such an extent on the accidental and, after all, unimportant, 
choice of reference systems * 

To remedy such a state of affairs, impossible in mature science, the tensor 
calculus was invented The whole general theory of Einstein seems to demand 
that the equations of physics should ultimately be expressed in tensor forms, 
in other words, that 'universal laws’ should cease to be ‘local gossip’, a demand 
w hich must be granted, and on this point the Einstein theory is bex ond criticism 
and IS an epochal methodological advance of an irreversible structural lin- 
guistic character 

In dealing w'lth co-ordinate systems we have 
heretofore used them to represent only ‘spatial’ 
entities, spreads of different dimensions It is 
desirable to become acquainted with a different 
use of co-ordinates, in which one of them will 
represent ‘time’. The last use is just as simple 
as the former, but the graphs which we obtain 
are different 

Let us take the simplest example, of a point 
P moving uniformly along a straight line OX 
with the velocity of one inch per second We 
could represent its movement in one dimension, 
as in Fig 11, and say that our point P is at Pi 
after one second (/ = 1), at P 2 after two seconds 
(/ = 2) , at the point after n seconds (<=») 


Section C Space-time 



Fig 12

But we could also represent this movement m a different way We could 
choose two mutually perpendicular avcs OX and OT as in Fig 12, OX repre- 
senting the ‘spatial’ actual direction of the movement and OT, which we have 
heretofore used to represent a second ‘spatial’ co-ordinate, now representing 
the ‘time’ co-ordinate 

We would lay off on the X axis our inches, 1, 2, 3, . . n, and on the T axis 
our seconds 1, 2, 3, » In our two-dimensional space-time our point P would 

be at the point 0 (v: =0, / =0) After one second it would be at the point Pi 
(x = l, < = 1), after two seconds at the point Fa (* = 2, / = 2) , after n seconds 

at the point P„ (,v=n, t = n). We see that the position of our point P in two- 
dimensional space-time would be represented by a series of points each given 
by two data- one ‘spatial’, the other a corresponding ‘time’ If the intervals 
are taken indefinitely small, in the limit our ‘moving’ point would be represented 
by a static line inclined to the X axis. We could then speak either of our ‘moving’ 
point, or else not use the term ‘moving’ but speak of infinitely many static 
points, each given by two numbers, one representing a distance, the other 
‘time’ Our ‘moving’ point would become a static world-line. The reader should 
notice that in this case we have structurally changed our language from dynamic 
to static, and raised the dimension Our mathematical ‘moving’ ‘point’, which 
had no dimension in our one-dimensional ‘space’, is in our two-dimensional 
space-time represented by a static onc-dimensional line 

In this example we had uniform 
translation. We did not introduce 
acceleration The distances were pro- 
portional to the ‘times’, hence our line 
was ‘straight’ and inclined to the X 
axis at a constant angle 

Using such space-time representa- 
tion we see that a point when it is not 
‘moving’, but is stationary, is repre- 
sented by a line parallel to the ‘time’ 
axis T, as shown at A on Fig 13 Our 
point A is getting older, so to speak, but 

does not ‘move’ In the next case, the point B does not ‘move’ until it is some 
seconds old, when at B' it begins to ‘move’ with constant velocity. Point C 
‘moves’ in the beginning at one constant velocity until C where it acquires a 
certain different velocity and the direction changes 

In Fig 13, D represents a point experiencing a senes of sudden changes 
of velocities The graph is a succession of short straight lines forming a broken 
line or open polygon As the changes of velocity occur more and more frequently 
the sides of our polygon become smaller and smaller, and in the limit, as the 
changes of velocity become continuous, our bioken line becomes a smooth 
curve E. 

Motion with continuously changing velocity is called accelerated or 
retarded motion The rate of change of velocity is called acceleration and is 




628 VIII ON THE STRUCTURE OF MATHEMATICS 


represented by the second deri\ative of the distance with respect to the 'time', 
symbolically, A =dv/dt=d^s/dt- 

It IS important to notice that in space-time an accelerated motion is repre- 
sented by a curved line In uniform (constant velocity) motion the distances 
are proportional to the ‘times’, and the line is straight and its equation is of 
the first degree In accelerated motion the distances are not proportional to 
the ‘times’, the lines are curved and the ‘time’ element dt enters in the second 
degree at least, namely, as dt- 

For example, let us study the graph of the motion represented by the 
equation x =Al?ll which means that the distance * is proportional to the 
square of the ‘time’. 


Let OX (Fig 14) be the ‘spatial’ avis, 
and OT the 'temporal' axis We lay off 
on our T axis equally-spaced points, repre- 
senting the seconds 1, 2, 3, 4 , and calcu- 
late the distances x for each of these values 
from the equation x=At-/2 where A 
represents a constant acceleration 

Let us assume that the constant ac- 
celeration A IS given as 4 metres per 
second per second The equation v =4fy2 
becomes x=2fi. Corresponding to the values /=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , we ha\e the 
values * =0, 2, 8, 18, 32 , If we plot these points, and assume that the change 
IS continuous, we may join the points by a continuous curve, which represents 
the motion of the point as a curved world-line 



Similarly, in three-dimensional space-time, a point moving uniformly in 
the plane XY would be represented in the plane XY hy the hne AB, and in 
three-dimensional space-time by the static line AB', where the ‘times’ are 
proportional to the distance 



As we have already seen, non-recti- 
linear motion may be considered as accel- 
erated motion We will generalize the 
above to the case where any curved path 
IS traversed with constant velocity In this 
case the direction of the velocity is changed 
If we take the motion of a point which 
describes a circular orbit with constant 
velocity, It IS easy to find its acceleration, 
which is called in this case centripetal 
acceleration 


Let us consider a point P, moving in 
a circular orbit with a constant velocity v, as given in Fig 16 If at a certain 
‘time’ It IS at i4, after a short interval t, it will be at B The direction of the 
velocity will be changed from AA' to BB'.

If we construct the triangle DCE by drawing CD parallel and equal to 
AA', and CE parallel and equal to BB‘, we see that the angle Z.DCE is equal 
to the angle ZA'A"B' because the sides are parallel, and it is also equal to the 
angle ZAOB whose sides are perpendicular to AA' and BB'. The triangles 
ABO and CDE are similar be- 
cause they are isosceles and 
the angles between the equal 
sides are equal. Clearly the 
side DE =w, represents the 
supplementary velocity which 
transforms A A' into BB' We 
know that in similar triangles 
the sides are proportional so 
wecanwriteDE/ CD =AB/OA. 

By inspection of our figures we 
seethatDE CD =v,OA =r, 
the radius of the circle. The 
chord AB may be taken as the Fig 16 

arc AB of the circle, provided 

the ‘time'-inter%'al is taken sufficiently small Let us write chord AB =s. We 
have ii'/v =s/r or w =svlr. If we divide both sides of our equation by t we have 
VI / 1 = it'/ Ir But w/t = A , the acceleration, and s/t-v hence A=v~/r In words, 
the centripetal acceleration is equal to the square of the velocity in the circle 
dnided by the radius 

The abo\e formula is of structural importance because it is the foundation 
for the empirical proof of Newton’s law of gravitation For our purpose it is 
important for other reasons, to be stated later 

There are two more diagrams which should be considered, in this connec- 
tion Fig 17 represents the plane circular motion of a point P whose orbit in 
the p ane XY is the circle FAB In three-dimen- 



sional space-time the plane circular orbit of 
motion would be represented by the static 
cyhnd ical helix (or screw-line) with axis parallel 
to the ‘time’ axis T (Fig 17 ) We should note 
that the motion is dynanncally circular in the XY 
plane, yet a three-dimensional space-time repre- 
ser tation gives us a stationary helix 

Similarly for vibrational mo\ements which 
could be represented in one dimension by to-and-fro 
movements on the X axis from A to B and from B to 
A (Fig 18 ) Ifweintroduceourspace-timeformof 
representation by introducing the T axis, our vibra- 
tional world-line would be represented structurally

by a wax e-line along the T axis In particular, if the vibrational motion is simply 


harmonic, a proper choice of the ‘time’ unit makes the wave-line a sine curve ®

Becoming thoroughly familiar with these few 
simple examples takes away a great deal of 
mystery from the Mmkowski-Einstem and the 
new quantum world. We see that after all there 
IS nothing extraordinary in the fact that in 
languages of different structures we get different 
y forms of representations and pictures, and that 
in a world where accelerations abound we may 
very profitably use the term ‘cur\ ed’ 

When we come to speak about the Einstein 
theory, the four-dimensional space-time world of 
Minkowski, and the new quantum mechanics, 
Fic 18 we shall have considerable use for these few' 

notions and illustrations 

Section D The application of geometrical notions to cerebral localization 
In the present work we are 'dealing in the mam with structure and the 
adjustment of the structure of our languages to empirical structures, and at 
this point it will be of use to suggest some of the consequences which follow 
from what has been said 

The question of cerebral localization is a difficult and vital problem In 
former days it was supposed that the brain had individualized centres with 
stnctly defined functions Attempts were made to ascribe to definite cerebral 
parts definite functions such as 'memory', ‘intelligence’, 'morality', 'talents’ , 
In the meantime, experimental facts disproved such structural views, and as a 
reaction another tendency appeared , namely, to deny any localization 

Modern researches show unmistakably that both of these extreme ten- 
dencies are at variance with experimental structural facts It appears that the 
lower centres play a more important role according as the terminal, or higher 
centres, are less developed and that there is considerable \ ariability, at east m 
man, not only from the morphological and histological aspects but also from 
the functional aspect It was found impossible to generalize from the particular 
development of centralization and functional distribution in one species to the 
distribution in another species Localization may vary even in one indrudual 
under different circumstances Metabolism, and slight disturbances iq the 
functioning of a neuron, were also found to have a most far-reaching influence, 
shown m its relations to other groups of neurons. The problems of localization 
are far too complex to attempt even an account of them, the more so since t'he 
reader will find excellent accounts of them in the large literature on the subject 
The general conclusion reached by practically all investigators is that some 
localization of nervous function does exist, yet it has a certain variability which 
depends on an enormous number of factors 

The methods explained in this chapter will enable us to suggest a method 
by which wc can orient ourselves in the bewildering complexity of the function- 
ing of the nervous system 




ON GEOMETRY 


631 


One of the main difficulties is that the structure of this world is such, that 
It IS made up of absolute mdiMduals, each with unique relationship toward 
environment (m the broadest sense), and we have to speak about it in terms of 
generalities ‘Laws’ , formulated in the old two-valued ways, can never account 
adequately for the facts at hand, being only approximations The mathematical 
methods which have already been explained give us at once a great advantage 
We have seen that if we have a function, y =/(v), let us say, and take the graph 
of this function, to every point of the graph there corresponds a pair of values 
X and y. We have seen also that each of the four quadrants I, II, III, IV has 
a characteristic pair of signs In quadrant 
I, both X and y are positive, in II, x is 
negativ'e and y positive, mill, both x and 
y are negative , and finally, in IV, x is posi- 
tive and y negative We can easily see that 
the value of the v anables may be thought 
of as variable conditions different for each 
individual, and that definite localizations 
corres[Jond to them In our example we 
had to do with a function of one inde- 
pendent variable, and we had a one- 
dimensional line, curved in two dimen- 
sions When we had a function of two 
independent variables we had a surface, 
which in general was curved in a third 
dimension By analogy we may pass to any number of dimensions, where by 
dimension we do not mean anything mystenous, but roughly tlie number of 
variables involved in the problem 

We see that if we think of the activity of the nervous system in terms of a 
mathematical function with an enormous number of variables, we shall not 
only have place for the uniqueness of each individual, determined by the value 
of the variables and the character of tlie function, but that this would also 
imply a localisation, which is permanent in a given indiv idual at a given 'time' , 
which again implies the totality of 'circumstances’ , Our function would be 
N =f{xi, Xi, Xi, x„) 

In fact It IS hard to see how it is possible to analyse the activities of the 
nervous system in any other way The facts are, that every organism is an 
individual, distinct and different from others, and so vve must hav'e means to 
take this individuality into account Different values for different variables 
take care of this point Similarities are accounted for by the general structural 
character of the functions For instance, any quadratic equation with two un- 
knowns gives us a conic section An equation of the type y'=av represents a 
parabola, the graph of any equation of the form vy =a represents a hyperbola , 
For every definite set of values of our variables the implied localization is also 
definite, which corresponds to the fact that in a given individual at a given 
‘time’ , the localization is definite One value for the whole function can be

reached by guing different sets of values to the different variables For in. 
stance, in the function z=5i,— 2y— 1, if v = l and y = 1, then 7 — 1, but we can 
have z = 2 by taking x=l and y = 3 5. Or if one of the conditions be non-cx- 
istent, which means that the value of one of our variables is zero, for instance, 
T=0, we still could ha%e the value z =2 by taking y= -15 This fact accounts 
for the many-to-one correspondences of causal factors, typified, for instance, 
by sunshine or cod liver oil producing a similar effect 

It should be understood that in what is said here, the numerical values do 
not matter In most of the cases we are not advanced enough to be able to 
deal with such numerical values What is to be emphasized is the structure of 
the language we use The method should enable us, instead of dealing with 
generalizations in the old language, which somewhere hat e to be contradicted, 
to use a language of mathematical structure which shall account for the facts 
and leave room for the great individual varieties of organisms m structure and 
function 

After all, we should not be surprised that the theory of functions and 
language of functions is structurally appropriate in expressing, and so in under- 
standing, the funchomng of the ner\'ous system, or any other system Per- 
sonally I have benefitted greatly through this method, and many baffling 
structural complexities hav e been much simplified 

Structurally, when we use the language of functions, variables , we 
automatically introduce extensional structure, as already explained, and v\e 
have at our disposal methods of translation of different orders of abstractions — 
dynamic into static, and vice versa — ^which is a neurological .structural necessity 
for being rational and sane And surely science should try to be rational It 
should be stressed again that in our problem numerical values matter very 
little, but structure and method, for the many reasons already explained, are 
of paramount importance Perhaps even the v alue of numbers is due mainly 
to the structural fact that it has forced upon us extensional and relational 
methods It is the only language which is in accordance with the structure and 
functioning of the nerv ous system, and so helps to co-ordinate these activities 
instead of disorganizing them 

That these simple structural dependences haie been discovered so late is 
really astonishing The only explanation I can gi\ e of this is that we have been 
so engrossed in generalizing and generalizations that we lost sight of the fact 
that in life we deal structurally with absolute %ndividiials, and that the only 
language which preserves the extensional structural individuality for its elements 
is found in mathematics — specifically, in numbers 

It may be that a study of mathematical structure and the psycho-logics of 
mathematics will giv'e results of unparalleled human values, particularly foi 
our sanity The problems of sanity are problems of adjustment, and no means 
of adjustment should be disregarded It may also be that the main importance 
of mathematics will be found some day to be more in the mathematical methods 
and structure which it has originated, methods forced upon the mathematician

by the relational character of the entities he has to deal with, than in the pos- 
sible combinations of these entities thcmseK'cs 

At any rate, we must sadly admit that the problems of mathematical 
methods and structure and the psycho-logical values of mathematics have so 
far received very little attention, since we have failed to realize their human 
importance. In the future this problem will be further, and thoroughly, in- 
vestigated. 




PART IX 


ON THE SIMILARITY OF EMPIRICAL 
AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


The theory of relativity has resulted from a combination of the three 
elements which were called tor in a reconstruction of physics first, delicate 
experiment, secondly, logical analysis, and thirdly, epistemological con- 
siderations (457) BERTRAND RUSSELL 

The essence of Einstein's generalization is its final disentanglement of 
that part of any physical event which is contributed by the observer from 
that which is inherent m the nature of things and independent of all ob- 
seivers. (zii E T. bell 

Even Leibniz formulated the postulate of continuity, of infinitely near 
action, as a general principle, and could not, for this reason, become recon- 
ciled to Newton’s Law of Gravitation, which entails action at a distance 
and which corresponds fully to that of Coulomb (S47) Hermann \vd\l 

This limitation to what is directly observable is ultimately based on 
Mach's philosophy and, directly inspired by Mach, led three decades ago 
to the propagation of the so-called theory of "Energetics," which sought 
to recognise only quantities of energy as physically given and observable 
quantities. (48i) A sommerfeld

CHAPTER XXXV 


ACTION BY CONTACT 


The difficulty involved is that the proper and adequate means of describ- 
ing changes in continuous deformable bodies is the method of differential 
equations. . . . They express mathematically the physical conception of 
contiguous action. (45) max bosn 

The analysis of ‘matter’, 'space', and ‘time’ from the point of view of 
structure and of orders of abstractions has led us to far-reaching conclusions. 
Let us summarize the semantic results, and consider some of the immediate 
consequences 

We may begin by recalling the difference between the lower order and 
higher order abstractions The lower order abstractions are given to us by the 
lower nerve centres They are ‘dynamic’, ‘continuous’, non-permanent, shifting, 
unreliable, and above all unspeakable 

They have a character of immediacy, because, structurally in terms of 
order, they are closest to outside events They come first in order in the func- 
tioning of the nervous system We always associate with them some 'objectu ity’ 
as, by necessity, the eventual definition of an ‘object’ starts at this level 

It should be emphasized over and over again that, speaking correctly, 
on this level we cannot define anything, since abstractions on this lev'el are 
fundamentally unspeakable We may look, listen, handle, feel , but cannot 
speak and therefore cannot define. The moment we define our objects, we 
are no longer on the level of lower order abstractions By neurological structural 
necessity we have passed to the higher nerve centres (speech), and highei 
order abstractions This is what is meant when we say that this lower level 
IS unspeakable 

Because these lower order abstractions are closer to the outside events, 
and because they come first in order, they have a special character of immediacy, 
with which we must start The struggle begins when, through some primitive- 
made doctrines or structural assumptions (metaphysics), we try to avoid going 
any further than these low'er order abstractions As a matter of fact, this is an 
impossibility, because of the very structure of our nervous system However 
intensely we believe that it is possible to do so, and however ‘emotionally’ we 
attempt to do it, we are cherishing delusions, which easily become morbid 
identifications, delusions, illusions, and often hallucinations 

This level being unspeakable, the only way to function on this level is 
to look, listen , but to be silent outwardly as well as inwardly This last 
condition represents a most beneficial semantic state, really difficult, perhaps 
impossible, to acquire without training 

The higher order abstractions appear to be products of the activity of 
the higher nerve centres, further removed from the external events and lacking, 
therefore, in immediacy But these higher abstractions are static and so may 

637 



638 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


be analysed They have a separable unit ‘quantum’ structure, which can be 
treated indiiidually It should be carefully noticed that the static character 
of these higher order abstractions is the origin of their separable quantum 
character, conditioned by the human nen'ous structure They aie, if properly 
treated, reliable and are uniquely responsible for our being time-binders 

Again, by the structural necessity of our nervous system, we deal first 
with lower order abstractions, and nevt with higher order abstractions It 
must be noticed that no one, unless he is (pathologically) entirely depru ed of 
the higher nerve centres, is, or can be, an exception We all deal with lower 
abstractions first, and with the higher next, no matter how perfect or imperfect 
these abstractions may be 

The general confusion of orders of abstractions, the lack of theories, and 
therefore of structural understanding of the entirely different characters of 
these distinct orders of abstractions, leads to, and must result in, identification 
or confusion of orders of abstractions As the different processes are going on, 
whether we will it or not, in every single one of us, they may result in the 
delusional ascribing of the characteristics of the higher order abstractions to 
the lower order abstractions, as for instance, permanence, immutability . 
somewhere invoking ‘infinities’. When objectified, we have such semantic 
disturbances as fanaticism, absolutism, dogmatism, finalism , which often 
become morbid semantic states 

A similar confusion may lead to the delusional ascribing of the charac- 
teristics of the lower order abstractions to the higher ones Under such delusions 
we ascribe to the higher abstractions fluidity, shiftiness, non-permanence, 
‘non-knowability’ , which results in pessimism, cynicism, disregard for science, 
bitterness, fright, hopelessness and other equally vicious semantic disturbances 
These m turn affect by structural necessity the proper working of the entire 
organism, which always works as-a-whole 

The ^-system and other older systems were not only built before these 
facts became structurally known but were actually based on such confusion 
Hence their viciousness By building a language and a method of this nature 
they perpetuated and made effective mechanically through the structure of 
language, a harmful confusion This language being not m accordance with 
the structure and functioning of the nervous system and the world, must 
produce pathological results somewhere 

We have already seen that the use of the ‘is’ of identity is unconditionally 
delusional Naturally, attitudes (affective, lower order abstractions) which 
can assert, (higher order abstractions) that so and so on objective levels ‘is’ 
so and so, must lead to pathological results In science this is a profoundly 
unsatisfactory state of affairs and needs structural revision 

Mathematicians, though in the mam unconscious or innocent of the 
structural, semantic, and neurological issues involved, nevertheless have solved 
this problem by producing methods of passing from one order of abstractions 
to another, from dynamic to static, and vice versa The influence of these dis- 
coveries has also affected the other sciences unconsciously. Without consciously 



ACTION BY CONTACT 


639 


recognizing it, the modern trend of science is to banish from Us habits and 
methods the application of the ‘is’ of identity 

So in science we haie to use an actional, ‘behaviouristic’, ‘functional’, 
‘operational’ language, in which we do not say that this and this ‘is’ so and so, 
but where we describe eUcnsionally what happens in certain order \^'e describe 
how something behaves, what something does, what we do in our research work , 
If one asks, for instance, what ts ‘length’, what ts ‘space’, what vs ‘time’, what 
IS ‘matter’ , the onlj correct answer would be, ‘As you asked the question 
verbally, and I answer it verbally, the above terms remain terms, which beside 
structure, have no connection whatsoever with the external world’ Yet 
undoubtedly we are interested in this external world and we should like to 
use a language which would help us in understanding this world better What 
shall we do^ It seems that if we produce a language which is similar in structure, 
to the external world, somehow, as a map or picture is similar in structure 
to the region it pictures, we should have a uniquely appropriate language 
How can we do it? It is quite simple the moment we discover the principle 
First of all, abandon completely the A ‘is’ of identity, and, instead, describe 
ordered happenings in an actional and functional language Such a language 
shares with the external world at least the multi-dimensional order of happen- 
ings, and It gives us a solution 

It is easy to see that arguments (verbal) about ‘matter’, ‘space’, ‘time’ , 
will never become anything else than v'erbal All uses of the ‘is’ of identity, 
must lead to delusional evaluation The situation is radically changed when 
we use an actional or functional language, when we describe what a physicist 
does when he finds his ‘length’ or ‘second’ or any other entity he is interested in 

We should notice here that the above procedure involves extremely far- 
reaching structural and semantic consequences First of all, we abandon the 
vicious use of the ‘is’ of identity, and eliminate the semantic disturbance called 
identification We introduce automatically the full psycho-logical working 
mechanism of order, extenswnal methods and discrimination between the orders 
of abstractions We introduce the four-dimcnsional and differential methods, 
we build up static units, ‘quanta’, and so introduce measurement and its 
language called mathematics, which leads to structure and so to knowledge 
at each date 

It will be useful to recall why mathematics and measurements arc somehow 
so important in our lives Our nervous system, as we have seen, exhibits dif- 
ferent activities on different levels On one level the abstractions are shifting, 
non-permanent , on the other static and permanent in principle This is expressed 
in our lives in a longing for some peimanency, some security, some ‘absolutes’ 
Mathematics formulated this tendency first and with full success Mathematics 
has not only formulated full and successful theones of ‘change’, as, for instance, 
the theory of functions and the different calculi, but also full-fledged and 
remarkable theories of invariance under transformations These new theories 
of invariance are actually absolute formulations in the only sense in w Inch the 



640 IX. ON ICMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 

term ‘absolute’ has a mearunK, namely, relative, no matter to what; all jl 
which leads to the only content of knowledRc — structure. 

The whole Kmstein theory should, in this sense, be called the ‘theory cf 
the abaolutc', and can he expressed as the simple demand that ‘universal laws 
should be formulated in an invariant form, a most revolutionary demand and 

V et so slnu luralty natural that no one can deny it. 

\A'hfn we mathematize or speak about potential or actual measurements 
we are dealing with ordered, enleiwronal, actional, bchaviounstic, functional and 
operational entities, and so w'e build up a language which at least has a similar 
itructure to the external events Numbers imply units, quanta but al=o order. 
It seems that number is the only abstraction upon w'hich we all must agree. 
We nev cr doubt that a statement, such as that T have in my pocket five pennies', 
may he perfectly definite and asi ertainable for all The specific and unique 
relations called numbers seems to have absolute significance. It must be added 
that the existence of non-quantitativc branches of mathematics does not alter 
\v hat IS said here In these branches, the as> mmetneal relation of order remains 
paramount and vv'e may treat numbers from either of their two aspects, the 
cardinal or the ordinal 

The eiroch-making significance of the Einstein-Minkowski work consins 
precisely m the fact that they were the first toapply the abov'e, though without 
It IS true, formulating the general principle The lack of such a general, 
epistemological formulation retards considerably the understanding of their 
work, and so laymen miss the enormous structural, and semantic beneficial 
effect upon the pioper working of our nervous system and our sanitv 

Before giving a short methodological account of the Einstein theory it 
will be well to recall some structural and semantic conclusions which the 
differential calculus suggests 

When vve were dealing with the notion of a variable, we saw that the 

V ariable might be any element selected out of an ordered aggregate of elements 
We can select elements relatively widely separated from each other, as, for 
instance, the numbers 1 and 2, or points, let us say , an inch apart. It is obv lous 
that if vve choose, we can make the gaps smaller, and postulate an infinity ol 
intermediate steps When we make our gaps smaller, the elements are ordered 
more densely and closer together In the limit, if we choose indefinitely many' 
elements betw'cen any two elements, our senes become compact, if we still 
have a possibility of gaps, or they eventually become what we call continuous, 
when there are no more gaps 

Without legislating as to whether the entities we use in physics are 'con- 
tinuous', ‘compact’, or ‘discontinuous’, we may grant that the maximum 
elucidation of the above terms in mathematics is very useful We can easily 
sec that in terms of action a continuous senes gives us action by contact, since 
consecutive elements are indefinitely near each other. As the differential and 
integral calculus were built on the structural assumption of continuity, the use 
of the calculus brings us in touch not only with our x but also with its indefinitely 
close neighbour x-\-dx We see that the calculus introduces a most important 



ACTION BY CONTACT 


641 


structural and semantic lnno^ ation, namely, that it is a language for describing 
action by conlact, in sharp contradistinction to the structural assumption of/ 
action at a distance. 

Let us illustrate the abo\ e by a structural example. Consider a series of 
equal small material spheres connected with each other by small spiral springs 
as shown on Fig. 1. 

\ 2 3 n 

Fig. 1 

These little spheres all have inertia, because of which, and because of 
the little springs, they resist displacement. If we displace the first of our spheres 
either in the transverse or longitudinal direction, it acts upon the second sphere, 
which in turn acts upon the third , . We see that the disturbance of equilibrium 
of the first little sphere is transmitted like a wave to the next sphere and so 
along the whole series The most significant point in the analysis of such a 
nave of excitation is that it is not transmitted with some ‘infinite veIocit>’, or 
‘infinitely quicklj ' or in ‘no time’ The action of each sphere is slightly delaj ed 
owing to its inertia, that is, it does not respond ‘instantaneously’ to an impulse 
It must be noticed that the displacement is not due to a tclocity, but to an 
acceleration, which is a change of velocity and requires a short intcrcal of 
‘time’ The change in velocity again requires an inter\ al of ‘time’ to overcome 
inertia and produce displacement Similar reasoning applies to a long train just 
being started by the engine The cars being coupled together by more or less 
elastic means, the engine may be moving uniformly and some of the last cars 
still be stationary The pull of the engine is not transmitted instantaneousl> 
but with a finite velocity, due again to the inertia of the cars 

We see that the only structurally adequate means of describing changes in 
continuous, deformable materials is to be found in differential equations which 
express a method of dealing with action by contact 

We have already seen that this action by contact invoices also the finite 
velocity of propagation, a fact of crucial structural and semantic importance 
In the history of science we can distinguish three periods The first was naturally 
the period of action at a distance, the best exemplified by the work of two 
great men, Euclid and Newton In it we find of course, a superabundance of 
‘infinities’. With the adeent of the differential calculus, and the introduction 
of differential equations in the study of nature, the notion of action at a distance 
became more and more untenable. We had a period of pseudo-contiguous 
action, which indeed involved differential equations, but the velocity of propa- 
gation was not introduced explicitly, and so there remained an implicit structural 
assumption of ‘infinite velocity’ of propagation As an example of such pseudo- 
contiguous action we can cite the older theories of potential, which give differen- 
tial equations for the change in the intensity of the field from place to place, 
41 



642 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


*but which do not contain members that express a change m ‘time’, and heiKc 
not take into account the transmission of electricity with finite velocilx ’ 

The modern theories, as for instance, the Maxwell theory of electromag- 
netism, and the Einstein theory , are based on action by contact These theories 
not only use the differential method, but they also introduce explicitly the 
finite velocity of propagation 

The inxenlion of differential geometry with the recent contribution of 
Weyl, which we have already mentioned, transforms the geometry of Euclid 
from a language of action at a distance into contact geometry , or a language 
of indefinitely near action 

It should be mentioned perhaps that the nemannian differential geometij' 
is more general than all the£ gee meines which preceded it, and includes them, 
as well as the E geometry , as sperial carfs Perhaps, as W’ey I points oul,^ the 
investigation of the famous fifth i".s:i.late, which was the beginning of E 
geometry, yvas accidental in im7'.i-ta"te and the main structural talue of the 
E geometries lies precisely H r>e arylication of the differential methods to 
geometiy which was origins.--:! the great work of Riemann This work, 
w-e see, has carried us frem nieta-h: steal action at a distance to a physical 
action by contact In passing from the older mechanics to electromagnetic 
events a very striking analog:, appears, which explains the finite velocity ot 
propagation 

In mechanics, when we have waves in an elastic medium, the finite velocity 
of propagation is due to the delay which occurs due to the inertia of materials 
Now inertia is determined by acceleration (d’s/dt^), which represents the rate 
of change of the velocity = velocity itself being a rate of change of 

displacement We see that this retardation, oi negativ^e acceleration, is repre- 
sented by a double differentiation 

Something analogous occurs in electromagnetic ev ents The rate of change 
of the electric field (de/dt) determines the magnetic field, and then the rate of 
change (dh/dt) of the latter determines the electric field at a neighbouring 
point The advance of the electnc field from point to point is thus conditioned 
by two differentiations with resjiect to ‘time', which is quite analogous to 
acceleration 

It IS due to this double differentiation with respect to ‘time’ that the 
formulation of electromagnetic waves are structurally possible If the partial 
effects were to occur without loss of ‘time', no propagation of the electric wav es 
would occur The mawvellian ‘field equations’ not only express the above- 
mentioned relations, but introduce structurally the finite velocity of propaga- 
tion which makes the Maxwell's electromagnetic theory structurally a contact 
theory 

The Einstein theory is also stnjcturally' a contact theory, and it may be 
said that It was originated by this contact tendency, and has carried it to the 
limit, as we shall see later The gaussian theory of surfaces, whose extension 
to any number of dimensions was made by Riemann, also represents action 
by contact. This theory does not state the laws of surfaces on a large scale, 



ACTION BY CONTACT 


643 


but only their differential properties, the coefficients of the measure determii i- 
lion, the invaiiants which we can form, and the cur^atuie and its measif e 
The form of a surface and its characteiistics can then be calculated by a process 
similar to the solution of differential equations in physics 

We are now in a position to understand why the newer physics and the 
^ systems, which are built entiiely on the foundations of action by contact, 
found the jS-s>stem unsatisfactory The£-system was built on the structural 
assumption of action at a distance, and we had to select the E geometries as 
originated by Gauss, Lobatche\ ski, Riemann, and others, which gave to physics 
the necessary geometry of action by contact 

But the question of action at a distance versus action by contact has 
also an expenmental aspect which makes the latter theory more satisfartorj 
Faraday (1791-1867) was not a learned academician, and he was much 
freer from scientific prejudices than any of his contemporaries From a book- 
binder's apprentice he became through his genius one of the founders of modern 
physics His method of experimenting was to try ev'ery possible evpeiiment 
and note what happened 

In 1838 Faraday made an important stiuctural discovery, nainelv, that 
the mutual action between two electrically charged bodies depends upon the 
character of the intervening medium Faiaday established by this expciimont 
that the capacity of a spherical condenser changes when another mateiial is 
used as the separating medium, rather than air He found that the capacitv 
became twice as large when the medium was paraffin, three tunes as large for 
shellac, six times as large for glass, and about eighty times as large for watci 
This experiment became the foundation of the new theory The old ‘action 
at a distance’ theory postulated that the electrostatic field was mcrc-lv a 
geometrical structure without physical significance, while this new experiment 
showed that the field had physical significance Every charge acts first upon 
Its immediate sunoundings, and it is only through the medium of these that 


the action is propagated The 
discovery of displacement cur- 
rents necessitated an extension 
of his point of view to all 
distances ® 

Faraday was so impressed 
by this discovery that he aban- 
doned the older theories of 
action at a distance and formu- 
lated a structurally new theory 
of contiguous action for electric 



and magnetic ev'ents. Any one 


Fic 2 


can convince himself of the fact that the fields represent very actual physical 


conditions by taking a sheet of paper, sprinkling some iron dust upon it and 


644 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


putting a magnet under the paper He will find that the particles of iron dust 
arrange themselves in a very definite structure as shown in Fig 2 

Faraday also discovered that the forces between two magnetic poles like- 
wise depend on the medium that happens to be between them He concluded 
correctly that the electric as well as the magnetic forces are produced by a 
state of tension in the intervening medium. 

These two examples will suffice as illustrations, but it can be said in general 
that all modern physics gives ample proofs of the correctness of Faraday’s 
structural point of view Some physicists, for instance Helmholtz, built special 
devices to test the correctness of this theory As a matter of fact the success 
of the whole electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, which is structurally built as 
a contact theory, in which the velocity of propagation is considered finite, is 
in Itself one of the best proofs of the correctness of the theory. 

The finite velocity of light was discovered by Olaf Romer in 1676 and has 
since been repeatedly verified This velocity is usually denoted by c and is 
known to be approximately 300,000 kilometres per second, that is, 
f =3xl0‘“cm /sec , or 186,000 miles per second 

In 1856 Weber and Kohlraush calculated a certain constant which appears 
in the electromagnetic theory, and discovered that the constant had the 

dimension of velocity, [ c ] = ^ | numerical value was 

3 xlO'^cm /sec , which is the exact value for the velocity of light This fact 
led Maxwell to associate light with electromagnetic waves, a view justified by 
experiments In 1888 Hertz not only established once more the interrelation 
of optics and electrodynamics but found that the velocity of propagation of 
electromagnetic waves is finite and exactly equal to the velocity of light * 

Outside the exact sciences the principle of action by contact is making but 
slow progress, perhaps because of ^4 ^ r and the lack of structural formulations 
of the general issues at hand We are happy to find a notable exception in the 
biological work of Professor C M Child, who has laid down a foundation for 
A. biology and his system is structurally based on action by contact This 
A biology has been applied to neurology by Professor C J Herrick This 
present work, being a ^-system, must follow the methodological and structural 
advances explained here, and the A biology and neurology founded by Child 
and Herrick. 

It IS interesting to follow up the structural merging of geometry and physics 
There arc certain Smiths and Browns who call themselves physicists There 
are some rooms with various instruments, which are called physical labora- 
tories The activities of the physicists which interest us are twofold First, 
these scientists come to their laboratones, manipulate their instruments, note 
the positions of some pointers, manipulate the instruments again, note posi- 
tions again , . This represents the vn-speakable level of activity Whatever 
happens happens, but there is no speaking to be done on that level 



ACTION BY CONTACT 


645 


Later the scientist describes his experiments in words Obviously there are 
two entirely different stages m building physics, which usually we do not dis- 
tinguish. 

Quite obviously the unspeakable level cannot be called ‘physics’, and so 
we must apply the term to the higher order abstractions on the verbal level, 
namely, to the reasoned verbal account of what the experimenter saw, or felt, 
or experienced, in general abstracted on the lower levels, summarized, general- 
ized . , in higher orders 

Physics represents then a verbal discipline Being verbal, it needs a lan- 
guage What language shall we select? As we want to have a science called 
physics, we shall naturally try to use the most structurally correct language in 
existence, so by necessity we must look in the direction of mathematics 

In mathematics we find originally two entirely different disciplines One 
we may call arithmetic, the other, geometry. Becoming acquainted with these 
two originally separated languages, we find that the actual experiments and 
the stimuli for many experiences of importance to us, are outside our skins, so 
we try to choose the one of these two languages which is the more closely re- 
lated in structure to the lower abstractions — that is, to what we see, feel , 
Naturally we have an inclination toward the geometrical languages, dealing 
with ‘lines’, ‘surfaces', ‘volumes’ . , terms for which we find immediate and 
quite obvious applications. By further investigation we find that of late both 
languages have become so developed in structure, that either can be translated 
perfectly into the other This fact makes geometry the link between the higher 
order abstractions and the lower order abstractions We have seen that physus, 
as well as geometry, must be considered verbal disciplines and their fusion 
becomes a very natural fact. 

It IS true that, as yet, ‘time’ appears as the bothersome factor, but ‘time’ 
may very well be represented geometrically, except that our diagrams and 
figures look a little different. For instance, a flat circular orbit in two-dimensional 
‘space’ becomes a helix in three-dimensional space-time, a vibrational motion 
in one-dimensional ‘space’ becomes a wave-line in two-dimensional space-lime , . 
‘Time’, when properly represented, becomes simply another geometrical 
dimension 

It should not be forgotten that mathematicians obtain most of their struc- 
tural inspirations from physics and build up mathematical theories to supply 
the structural needs of the physicist We see an excellent example of this in the 
E, geometries In the days of Euclid, when physics hardly existed, we had 
‘emptiness’, ‘action at a distance’, and such notions as were quite satisfactory 
for the needs of surveyors and builders With the development of astronomy 
and physics, curved lines became more and more structurally important, and 
the haziness of the definition of ‘straight line’ also became apparent. The 
notion of ‘emptiness’ also became slowly structurally untenable Such geometers 
as Gauss, Lobatchevski, and others, began to demand that the axioms of 
geometry be tested by experiment With the introduction of ‘curvature’, the 
‘straight line’ became only a special case of a curve with zero curvature.

The invention of the differential calculus also had a tremendous structural 
influence. It introduced continuitj- as a basic assumjition in the tast structure 
of science, and cleared the waj for psjcho-logicallj' trained scientific workers in 
structural continuity, and therelore in action by contact 

The dlsco^er\ that light appears as electromagnetic waves and the finite 
velocity of both, made the notion of ‘absolute emptiness’ structurally un- 
tenable, and so £ geometry with its action at a distance, ‘emptiness’ and neglect 
of gra\ntation and electncii>, became very unsatisfactory Indeed if our uni-

Leibnitz, who invented the differential calculus independently of Newton, 
formulated a postulate ol action by contact, and therefore could not become 
reconaltd to Newton's Law of Gravitation which was structurally a law of 
action at a distance, corresponding fully' to Coulomb’s law in electiicity The 
latter law states that the force e.\erted by two electrically charged bodies upon 
each other is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, 
and acts in the direction ot the line joining them ° 

The introduction by Faraday of the structural notion of a ‘field’, instead 
of the nonon of electrical charges acting at a distance, introduced the notion of 
a strain of the electrical field, which appears structurally as ‘lines of forces’ 
Here we already have a ‘fulness’ of ‘lines’ and a big step toward the structural 
fusion of phy sics with geometry has been taken 

The transition from £ to nemannian geometry corresponds structurally 
to the transition from physics based on action at a distance to physics based 
on action by contact The fundamental metrical theorem of £ geometry is the 
py thagorean rule, w'hich expresses the fact that the square of the distance be- 
tw'ecn two points is a quadratic form of the co-ordinates of the jxiints If we 
regard this theorem as strictly' valid only in the case of points which are very 
near each other, we pass at once from £ geometry to differential geometry 
By doing so we gain a notable structural advantage, as we dispense with the 
necessity of defining our co-ordinates more precisely, because the pythagorean 
law, when expressed in differential form, is invariant for arbitrary transfor- 
mations ® 

Semantically, Riemann W'as the immediate predecessor of Einstein, al- 
though Einstein was not directly influenced by him In differential geometry 
we ought to start w ith indefimtesimally near points, and depend for the analysis 
of greater distances, areas and volumes, on integration The difficult notion of 
‘straight line’ has to be replaced by the notion of the shortest line (geodetic), 
which is easily defined by differential methods and found empirically In the 
older method, the length of a curve was to be found, in general, by the process 
of integration. The length of a ‘straight line' between two points was supposed 
to be defined as a whole, and not as the limit of a sum of indefinitely little bits 
Riemann considered that a ‘straight line’ docs not differ in this respect from a 
curve. Measurements which are always performed by means of some instru- 
ment are physical operations, and their results depend for their interpretation

upon the theoi les of ph> sics Dealing with geodetics is therefore preferable to 
dealing t\ith ‘straight lines ^ 

W e see that the problem w as ripe for a final stroke of genius k.instem s

success in giiing a geometrical interpretation to the Einstein theory accom- 
plished the probably iiretersible fusion 

Three dimensional kinematics becomes four dimensional geometry, three 
dimensional dMiamiis can be considered asfoiti dimensional statics 

\\e see immediately the human, psjeho logical, semantic and neurological 
importance of this fact Our nertous sjslem by its structure produces ab- 
stractions of different orders dtnamic on some let els, static on others The 
problems of sanity and adjustment become problems of tianslation fiom one 
level to another, for which the structural advances in science suppK us with 
methods of solution 

It should be noticed that the semantic gam due to the above facts is con 
siderable, and that being structural, it is practical as well as thcoietical The 
fact that geometry has lost its old restricted status, which formerly applied 
principallj to what could be intuitively visuah/cd’ and has been further ab 
stracted to ajiply to what can be ‘conceived’, has merged geomctiy with the 
rest of mathematics This merging represents a great structuial and semantic 
step forward, and makes possible the treatment of geometrical problems by 
purely analvtical means It liberates geometry from the restiictions of lower 
order abstraction* By using ‘geometrical intuition’ (lower order abstractions) 
we find again a gieat help in analvsis 

In the cvclic nerve cuireiits, our so called ‘intuitions’ (lower order ab 
stractions) are not struct ui ally isolated from our conceptions' (higher order 
abstractions), but both are intimately connected and influence each other 
Modern advances are not only in perfect accord with the 'organism as-a-whole 
principle, but indeed give us evcellent proofs that this principle is sound. ‘Psy- 
chologists’ miss a great deal by disregarding this important and unique form of 
human behaviour which we call matheraatizing 



CHAPTER XXXVI 


ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY 


It is preasely here, in an improved understanding of our mental relations 
to nature, that the permanent contribution of relativity is to be found 
We should now make it our business to understand so thoroughly the 
character of our permanent mental relations to nature that another change 
in our attitude such as that due to Einstein, shall be forever impossible. 

(S5) P. W, BKIDGM.tN 

It IS not my aim to expound the Einstein Theory as such There are many 
excellent and competent books w ntten on this subject I have already explained 
and stressed several structural points which in the last analysis are the founda- 
tion of Einstein's vi ork. Many ‘thinkers’ through the ages ha\ e felt v aguely the 
dangers of the structure of language and the Mciousness of objectification, that 
is, of the delusional ascribing of objective values to verbal forms This vague 
feeling, of course, is useful in individuals, but it is a private benefit, which 
cannot be made public without some sort of formulation The stroke of genius 
of Einstein was that he produced a non-elemenlahstic, linguistic system of new 
structure Einstein, being a physicist, decided rightly, as we understand now, 
to be entirely actional, behavuouristic, functional, and operational, and to stop 
gambling on words. The older el linguistic problems of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and 
‘time’ were m such a mess, due to the objectification of verbal structures, that 
it was useless to talk any more in the old way He decided to describe what a 
physicist does when he measures ‘space’ and ‘time’, and to abandon, perhaps 
unconsciously, the ‘is’ of identity 

It seems unnecessary to stress the simple fact that when we measure a 
piece of wood, for example, we mark it off w'lth another piece of material which 
we have accepted arbitrarily as our ‘unit of length' The coincidence of our 
‘unit' with the intervals between the marks is again judged by an extremely 
complex electromagnetic-neural process, which was quite disregarded until 
Einstein Our judgement is conditioned by the light rays travelling wdth finite 
velocity which excite our nerv ous system through the retina, this excitation in 
turn also travelling with finite velocity. We see that the apparently simple 
measurement of a ‘length’ is really an extremely complex process, in w'hich the 
finite velocity of light and of the nerve currents plays a very important role 
Naturally, if we were to assume an ‘infinite’ velocity of the propagation of light, 
our verbal speculations about ‘space’ and ‘time’ might be perhaps entertaining, 
but they would nevertheless be fundamentally and structurally wrong. 

Similar remarks apply to the measurement of ‘lime’ What do we mean 
when we say that a tram has arrived at the station at 9 o’clock? We mean no 
more and no less than that the arrival of the tram coincided with the arrival 
of the pointer of a clock at a point marked 9 on the clock face. In other words, 

648 



SEMANTICS OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY 


649 


we saw 'simultaneously’ the arrival of the tram and the pointer of the clock 
reaching the mark 9 

Our judgement about the results of measurements of ‘time’ depends on the 
seen coincidence of events — in this case, of the arrival of the train with the 
an i\'al of the pointer of the clock at the mark 9 Similar considerations, w hich 
applied to the measurements of ‘lengths’, apply also to the measurements of 
‘time’. 

We see with Einstein that if we want to make any headway we shall ha\ e 
to investigate the two key terms, namely, ‘velocity’ and ‘simultaneity’ 

The newtonians take a particular delight m accusing Einstein of being a 
‘psychologist’ and not a physicist We have already stressed the physical sub- 
jectivity of physical instruments What is said there applies, not only to the 
retina of the eye, but also to a photographic camera, or to a microscope or tele- 
scope, or any other instrument Before an energetic packet, be it a hght-impulse 
or a bullet, is able to accomplish any result it must first reach its mark, and so 
the finite velocity of propagation must be taken into consideration, which is a 
hard, established, empirical structural fact So the criticisms of the newtonians 
are simply shallow and unscientific (1933) They disregard most important 
empirical physical facts, and so simply defend a semantic disturbance without 
aiding science (1933) 

With the emstemians, we treat the eye on the same footing as we would 
treat the camera or any other physical instrument E\en the newtonians must 
admit that when they photograph some happening on the sun, for example, the 
happening actually occurred (approximately) eight minutes hejore the photo- 
graphic plate ivas affected The eight minutes is the ‘time’ taken by the light 
to reach the earth from the sun 

Let us anal} se the term ‘velocity’ first We find oiirseli es here, as in any 
other human problem, on two distinct levels of abstraction, and we must dis- 
criminate betw een them 

Let us take up the verbal level first We see that before we can talk about 
our terms ‘space’ or ‘time’, ‘length’ or ‘seconds’, we have to know a great deal 
about the term ‘velocity’ How do W'e define the term ‘velocity’'* We define 
It as ‘space diMded by time’, v^sfl We see that on the iierfeof lei el the situation 
IS perfectly hopeless and no result can be expected from verbal gambling 1 1 
may be added that older notions were based on objectification, or confusion 
between the two levels of abstraction, and the affective belief m the magic of 
words, identification playing most of the structural ha\oc 

How about the instrumental level, the silent leiel of the lower order ab- 
straction’ On this level, we find that physicists in their actions, behaviour, 
operations , have elaborated a fairly definite technique for finding the data 
they require So we see that there is no choice, we must start on this level 

But starting on this le\el is not all, and not enough We must somehow 
talk about these doings and operations Hence we must select a language which 
in Its structure will reflect the structure of these actions and operations There- 
fore we must abandon the ‘is’ of identity and describe in the asymmetrical

language of order the happenings recorded by an instrument or by our loiter 
nerve centres 

Without going into details \ie may summarize the results as achieved by 
the physicists Experiments by the physicists, as indicated by the coincidences 
of pointers on different instruments, ha\e seemingly established the fact that 
the ‘velocity’ of light, as defined by beJiavioimstic, operational instrumental 
means, is a constant, c = 3 10^“ cm /sec , independent of the relative velocity of 
the observers By' the ‘observers’ we mean again the readings on the instru- 
ments which the observer carries with him Now this result contradicts flatly 
the established verbal expectations which we reached on verbal levels through 
the elementalistic structure of language and the semantic disturbance, of 
ascribing ‘objectiv e’ existence, to the terms ‘space’ and ‘time’ 

The situation is acute Shall we follow our semantic disturbances and 
reject hard empirical structural facts, or shall we accept the experimental facts 
and eliminate semantic disturbances'* 

As usual, the answer is implied by the method of putting the question 
We accept the experimental facts and revise our semantic disturbances In 
this case a psychiatrist might be a useful co-worker with the physicist. 

The einsteinian revolution is structurally and semantically so fundamental, 
that every intelligent person should be acquainted with it It will therefore be 
as well to consider some of its details 

In classical mechanics we had the classical mechanical principle of rela- 
tivity, namely , that all mechanical equations have one form for two co-ordinate 
systems moving uniformly with respect to each other The above has a very 
simple empincal meaning If we travel in a tram, let us say at a velocity of 
50 miles an hour, all our activities in the train hav e one familiar relative velocity 
as if the tram were at rest. If vve throw a ball with a v'elocity of 20 miles an 
hour to another passenger on the tram in the direction of the movement of the 
tram, the ball vv ill not reach the other passenger with the v elocity of 20 miles 
an hour plus the additional 50 miles an hour velocity of the tram but will reach 
him vv'ith the velocity as if the tram were standing still Not so, however, if the 
ball were thrown to an observer, standing on the tracks The ball might hurt 
him, because it would have, relative to him, the velocity of 20 miles an hour ot 
the ball, plus the velocity of 50 miles an hour of the tram, or in all, a velocity 
of 70 miles an hour. 

Quite probably, even our remote ancestors who used artificial means of 
transportation on land or water did not overlook the structural fact that me- 
chanical events happen in just one way, whether the system is at rest or in 
relative motion With the advent of veibal formulations of physics and me- 
chanics, such happenings were formulated verbally, and so, slow'ly, the language 
of old structure with its consequent objectifications was built 

Now on verbal grounds, which seemed to be justified by experimental, 
macro-mechanical facts, we concluded that one law should prove valid in the 
case of electrodynamic and optical events. 



SEMANTICS OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY 


651 


To reformulate the above in simple s> mbols, let us imagine two parallel 
co-ordinate systems, (Y and 0" ^ of which the second moves with a velocity n 
relative to the first in the common x direction If we denote the co-ordinates 
of the first system by single primes, and the 
co-ordinates of the second system by double Y' Y" 
primes, then, as usual, the co-ordinates of a 
point, P, m the second system would be con- 
nected with Its co-ordinates in the first system 
by the equation x"=x' — iit, which means that 
the x" co-ordinate is less than the x' co-ordinate 
by the amount that our second co-ordinate 0'' 
system has moved, namely, by a=ut We gave 
the diagram in two dimensions because it is simpler, 
and, as we have assumed that the displacement is parallel to the x a\is, the 
other co-ordinates remain unaltered, y"=y', z" =z' ‘Time’ by the older as- 
sumptions, being ‘objective’ and ‘absolute’ would be ‘the same’, namely, l" =t' 
(‘absolute time') The classical law of relatii e motion states that if the equation 
of motion in the first system is/' (»', y', z', t) =0, this function must also be 
zero when *' is replaced by its new value, namely, (x'—tit)=x" so that 
/' (*", y". z", t) =0

If we select a three dimensional co- 
ordinate system O, the distance s of the 
point P from 0 is equal, by the Pytha- 
gorean rule, to s^=x-+y'‘+z^ If we 
assume that a hght ray is travelling from 
0 to P, the distance J could then be 
represented by the product of the i elocity 
of light c by the ‘time’ or ct The square of this distance would then be cV=i- 
We have or x-+y--\-z-—i^i- ~0 

We can easily consince ourseKes that if the last equation for light-waies 
holds good in the first co-ordinate system it cannot hold in the second 

Writing the last equation in our primed letters, we have x'^ +y'- -t-z'- —cH^ = 0 
If we pass to our second system of co-ordinates moving uniformly in the X 
direction with the velocity k relative to the first system, our y', z', t, do not alter 
by assumption, but only x"=x' — ut. We would ha\e by substituting \' — iil

But, by assumption, a'-+ 3 ’'*+ 2 '^— cV=0, and therefore equation (1) 
cannot be zero unless (ii-/-— =0 This last condition would mean that 
our second s>stem of co-ordinates is also at rest We see that for hght-viaves 
the older mechanical principle of relativity does not hold, as the equations are 
altered when we pass from one system of co-ordinates to another which moves 
with uniform ielocit\ relati\e to the first 

To indicate this more obviously, we will express it in formulae Consider 
two co-ordinate systems O' and 0", in which the second moves with a uniform 
velocity in the X direction relative to the first If for the hght-waves the equa- 
tion \'-+y'-+z'^—cH-=0 holds in the first system, a similar equation for the 
second moMng co-ordinate system, c-t^=0, cannot be true In 

other words, \'-+y'-+z'-—c-t‘^ 9 ^x"^+y'^+z"^—c-^, whence we have an 
tnequahty, fundamentally contradicting the classical principle of relativity 

This extraordinary and unexpected inequality, because it contradicted 
structurally the classical mechanical principles of relatii ity, which apparently 
had been well established experimentally, created a baffling semantic situation 
which was profoundly unsatisfactory 

What could we do about it^ Should we abandon the older principle of 
mechanical relatiMtj , or should we have two different laws, one for the older 
gross macroscopic mechanical relalivitj, and another for optical and electro- 
dynamic eients, or should W'e investigate the fundamental structural assump- 
tions which underlie our formulae, and see if the discrepancy is not due to some 
prejudice or some structural dogma which we have overlooked for centuries? 

If a solution of the last kind should be found it would naturally be most 
satisfactoiy The admission of two relativities, one for the mechanical events, 
the other for the optical events, would be against the whole trend of science, 
which requires the unification of theories 

Such a structural revision, namely, the rooting out of the old unjustified 
dogma w'hich made all the trouble, was the work of Einstein’s genius In this 
epoch-making discovery he was assisted in the beginning by the famous 
Michelson-Morley experiment, since performed repeatedly with similar results, 
seemingly proMng that the velocity of light is a constant no matter what the 
relative motion of the observer If we take the equation for the spherical 
propagation of hght-waves r^-py^-l-s-— c-<- =0 or x^+y^-\-s^

then c= ^ in one system of co-ordinates, 

and c= in another system of co-ordinates, 

are equal, which stated in another form would mean that 

+32 = +2 + J ,.2 +„/2 _ ^ 2^2 

The expenment says this relation is true, the arguments already advanced show 
it cannot be true So we have to hunt for some error or compensation 

With Einstein’s explanation, the finding of the error is simplicity itself 
In the older mechanical relativity our ‘space’ and ‘time’ were objectified, we

endowed them with objectiv e values of definiteness and rigidit> . we dealt with 
'absolute space’ and Mith ‘absolute time', which w'as ‘unchanging’ and ‘the 
same for all' In the older assumptions our tcloalies varied If A had 4 \elocity 
of 5 centimetres per second, for instance, and 5 was o\ertaking A with a ve- 
locity of 7 centimetres per second, the relative velocity between A and B would 
be 7 —5 = 2 cm per second The units of ‘ipace’ and ‘time’ were definite, immutable 
and did not and could not vary, which followed directly from the assumptions of 
an ‘objective’ ‘absolute space' and ‘absolute time’. 

In the case of light, we came in contact with a velocity which did not vary 
for any observer no matter what his relative motion The velocity c was found 
to be constant, so the natural assumption to make is that our ‘space’ and ‘time’ 
vary for different observers. 

In the above equations as they stand, ‘absolute time’, t=t, the ‘same’ for 
all observers is assumed, which made such equality impossible Assuming dif- 
ferent ‘times’ for different observers, t for the first, and t' for the second, such 
a compensation transforms our inequality into an equality, as demanded both 
by the experiment and by the theory Instead of writing 

x^+y^+z^ -c¥ =x'^+y’- +z'‘ -cH\ (t=t), 
which cannot be true, we write, 

xi +yi +zi -cH^ -by'Hs'® -cH'^ = 0 , (/ t') 

which can be true We should notice that in the first equation w'e have on both 
sides t, which makes the equation impossible, whereas in the second equation 
we have on the left-hand side t and on the right-hand side a different t , namely , t' 

The above considerations mean that there is a definite structural discrepancy 
between the old language and the empirical world, requiring a fundamental 
structural linguistic revision This rev ision has been accomplished, and is known 
as the Einstein theory It is not implied that Einstein's work is final, but that 
It shows clearly the structural errors of the old elementalism to which we can 
never return 

In other words, in the older mechanics we had definite and permanent 
‘time’ (absolute) and varying relative velocities. Dealing with light-waves we 
find experimentally that the velocity, c, of light does not vary with the relative 
motions of the observers and we must assume a variable tme to preserv e our 
equations. 

An obvious objection can be raised to this w hy alter our habitual notions 
of ‘time’'* Can we not keep the old j r and find some other method of compen- 
sation, less bothersome and less revolutionary? The older jihysicists and Einstein 
give a long and convincing list of perfectly sufficient reasons for such a change, 
yet their arguments always leave us somehow in doubt, with the feeling of a 
lurking possibility that the old can be preserv cd 

What has already been said in this work about structure and semantic 
disturbances and the fact that the terms ‘matter’, ‘siiacc’, and ‘time’ are not 
objects, w'hich they cannot be, removes perhaps for good and all, the last doubt 
as to the revolutionary and epoch-making significance and value of the struc- 
tural linguistic discoveries of Einstein. On these grounds alone the return to 



654 IX. ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


the old is impossible The old is due to objectification of the structural peculi- 
arities of the old el language, and to semantic disturbances, which at the present 
low leiel of our deielopment is ine\itably the result of copying lower animals 
in oiir 'thinking', a pathological process for 'man' 

It will be well to explain at this point whj I said that the Michelson-Morley 
experiment only assisted Einstein, and only seemingly proved the constant 
velocity of light Historical!) , there is no doubt that the beginning of the 
theory of Einstein ivas suggested b>, and had its ph}sical basis in this ex- 
periment In reality, as the whole of this present work about structure shows, 
the two issues are quite independent The fact of the/«i/e velocity of light has 
never been challenged, on the contrary it is becoming more and more solidl) 
established, both empirically and theoreticalK , simply because an ‘infinite 
\elocit)’ has no meaning 

With the structural results of this present work, and the establishment of 
the fact of the finite -velocity of light, the whole Einstein theory has a perfectly 
solid structural, linguistic foundation (1933) Nevertheless it is extremely 
gratifying that the latest, very important, and painstaking work of Doctor 
Roy J Kennedy seems once more to add fundamental experimental support 
to the correctness of the Einstein theory * From the point of view of structure, 
Einstein merely eliminated some primitive, perhaps even animalistic, remains 
of objectification which still lingered in the structure of our language of ‘matter , 
‘space', and ‘time' These, being animalistic, were unfit for humans, vitiating 
not only our daily lives but science as well (Eddington in The Mathematical 
Theory of Relativity, p 196, uses the term ‘pre-human’ in a similar connection.) 

It must be recalled that the definition of velocity is connected in a circular 
way with ‘space’ and ‘time' That is, in the definition of the relation of velocity, 
(v=s,'t), ‘space’ and ‘time’, the definition of any one of our three terms depends 
upon our definition of the other two, whence there are many possible wa)s of 
verbal adjustment 

As wc saw, the mechanical verbal principle of relativit) wdth which we are 
all familiar was not structurally able to account satisfactorily for a similar 
relativity of optical and electrodynamic events The older formulae of trans- 
formations were, as already given, x' =x—ut, V =y, c' =c, t =f These formulae 
are called the Galileo transformations in honour of the founder of mechanics, 
and, as we have seen, structurally they are not general enough 

If vve consider the equation c-t* =0 and x'- +y'^ —cH'^ =0, 

we find that the galilean transformations do not satisfy them Lorentz and 
Einstein have found another set of transformations which satisfies uniquely the 
above equations These formulae of new structure are called the Lorentz- 
Einstcm transformation, and are given by the following equations x' (x—vt), 
y' —y, z' =z, t' {t—vx/c^), where v is the relative velocity of one s)stem with

SEMANTICS OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY

respect to the other, c, as usual, represents the velocity of light, and the factor 
/3 = 1/V 

The most striking charactenstic of these formulae is that if we assume 
that c, the velocity of light, is ‘iitfinite’, all the expressions containing would 
become zero, c“ entering only in the denominators of fractions In such a limiting 
case j3 = l/'V^ (1— 0)=1/1 =1 and x' = (x—ut), y' =y, s'=z, l' =t which are the 
older galilean transformations 

Thus there appears the astonishing fact that all the pre-einsteinian physics 
and mechanics which involved the structural assumption of the galilean trans- 
formation, had a tacit structural assumption of the infinite velocity of light 
This assumption, known since 1676 to be false as to facts, remained unnoticed 
before Einstein 

As e=3xl0'‘’ cm /sec , c^=9XlO*“ is a very large number, whence the 
fractions uv/c* and are very small, and /3 differs very’ little from unity 

If we apply the Lorentz-Einstein transformation instead of the older 
galilean transformation to mechanical problems, the changes are so small that 
they can hardly be detected by experiments, the terrestrial velocities or vx 
being so small in comparison with the square of the velocity of light. 

The galilean transformations are experimentally shown to be structurally 
invalid for optical and electrodynamic events The Lorentz-Einstein transfor- 
mations satisfy structurally the optical and electrodynamic events, and also 
apply to the older mechanical problems We see that the Lorentz-Einstein 
transformations are more general, as they include the galilean transformations 
as a particular case when we assume c =oo 

In a few instances, where we deal with large velocities, the values of the 
fractions containing the square of the velocity of light become appreciable and 
allow experimental testing As yet all such experiments have verified the 
Einstein theory 

We should repeat again that the achievement of Einstein was the building 
of a linguistic system similar in structure to the world, which eliminated a patho- 
logical pre-human factor of objectification of terms Such structural elimination 
was bound to bring some sanity to our theories, and this fact is independent of 
experiments in physical laboratories However, it is gratifying to find that ex- 
periments support (1933) the Einstein theory It was particularly gratifying 
in the beginning, when physicists and Einstein himself believed that his theory 
would stand or fall by experiment Today w'e see that this theory represents 
such an enormous general, structural, epistemological, psycho-logical, and 
methodological non-elementahstic adv ance, that no matter what the experiments 
show or may show in the future we cannot return to a language of the old, el, 
obviously w’rong, structure of the pre-einsteinian days As usual, the negativ’e 
results are the important ones No matter what experiments may show we shall 
nev'er again accept the silent structural assumption of ‘infinite’ velocity for 
light, when we know positiv ely that the velocity is finite We shall never again 
treat terms of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ as objects — lower order abstractions, 
w’hen we know that they represent terms — higher order abstractions When 



656 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


once this is realized, we cannot ascribe ‘finiteness’ or ‘infiniteness’, ‘definiteness’, 
‘rigidity’ , to terms, verbal forms, forms of representation From this point of 
view we may consider the Einstein theory as an irreversible gam If it had 
achieved only the elimination of various structural prejudices and dogmas, it 
has done well , and at least this much Einstein has already achieved. 

The structural, verbal, cortical quest for invariance in our formulations 
also becomes apparent The older mechanics were invariant under the galilean 
transformation, equations preserved their form in different systems of co- 
ordinates In the special theory of relatmty the new laws are invariant under 
the Lorentz-Einstein transformation In this special, or restricted, theory of 
relativ ity only uniform relative motion was taken into account If we generalize 
the principle of relativity to any kind of relative motion we pass from the 
restricted to the general theory, which demands that the laws of physics should 
be formulated in a generally inv ariant form for any arbitrary transformations 

For this structural, coi tical reason it is necessary to express all the laws of 
physics in tensor equations, which satisfy such conditions of general invariance 
If this cannot be done, there must be something wrong with our language, as 
such, and with our verbal laws We require structural revision of those laws so 
as to be able to express them in tensor equations The newtonian law of grav i- 
tation and the older form of the law of conservation of energy are perhaps the 
most remarkable e.xamples They do not survive such minimal, and yet entirely 
justified, structural requirements as those of the general theory of Einstein, and 
therefore they cannot be structurally satisfactory. 

We have already seen that the equation or +y^ — cV = 0 

represents the equation of the spherical propagation of light with the finite \ eloc- 
ity c The discovery that the velocity of light is a universal constant for all 
observers, and the above equation, led historically to the re-discov'ery by Einstein 
of the Lorentz transformation which, as we have seen, has assumed such ov er- 
vvhelming structural importance The meaning of these facts is worth considering 

In Chapter XVII we analysed briefly the elementalistic language of ‘matter’, 
‘space’, and ‘time’, and came to the conclusion that to eliminate objectification 
we must abandon the semantic disturbance and the use of the term ‘is’ of 
identity. Instead, we must use an actional functional language to describe 
ordered functioning, behaviour, or operations By necessity we were led to a 
‘contact’ method We also discovered that in accepting the abov'e structural 
methods vve were compelled to discriminate between different orders of ab- 
straction, since what we see, feel, and experience is not what we say about it 
We found that on the ‘objective’ level of our actual activities, (manipulating 
instruments ,) which represent the silent unspeakable level, we could never 
find a situation in which the old language of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ could 
be used without coming violently into conflict with the properly analysed 
facts We came to the conclusion that this language was not structurally satis- 
factory, for verbally, ‘space’, ‘time’, and ‘matter’ were supposed to be quite 
clear-cut and separate entities, while in actual experience we never could find 
such separated objective entities. It became obvious that the structure of the 



SEMANTICS OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY 


657 


old language of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ was different from the structure of 
the outside world as we now know it Wc found ourselves in a situation where 
we had to choose either to keep the old language which, as it differed from them 
in structure, could ne\er gi\e a coherent account of facts at hand, or else to 
build up a new language with structure similar to that of the outside world, in 
order to have the possibility of coherent conversation about it 

The invention of such a new language is of course an extremely difficult 
undertaking In fact, it requires some genius to in\ent new, more structurally 
similar, forms of representation for the old facts Lorentz, Einstein, and Min- 
kowski prepared and finally produced such a structurally new language The 
difficulty was that verbally we had already separated what empirically could 
not be separated The problem was to amalgamate somehow the old struc- 
turally elementahsttc language of ‘space’ and ‘time’ into a non-elementahshc 
language. The key to such an amalgamation is found in the light-wa\e equation 
which gives us the structural information about the world, x“-(-y--t-:^ 

This equation represents an equality The left-hand side is expressed in 
‘spatial’ terms only — the distance between two points 0 and P The right-hand 
side expresses the ‘spatial’ length, but in a ‘temporal’ term We see that here 
we have means of translation, and a possibility of amalgamation of two ele- 
mentahstic languages, which were not supposed to be mtertranslatable 

The Lorentz-Einstem transformation formulae are x'=j8 {v—vl), y'=y, 
z' = 2 , t' (t—vx/c^) where v is the relative velocity of the two sy stems of co- 
ordinates, c, the constant velocity of light, and /0 = l/V(l —v^/c^) 

The formulae for «' and which typify, on the left-hand side, a' a ‘spatial’ 
length and /' a ‘time’, are of particular interest We see that on the right-hand 
side of the expressions the value of the ‘spatial’ x' is given by (3 (v — I'l) which 
involves ‘time' The value of ‘time’, t' is gnen by /3 {t—vx/c^), which involves 
the ‘spatial’ length x So we see that our amalgamation is complete, and separa- 
tion impossible. The above formulae express structurally the simple experi- 
mental fact that ‘space’ and ‘time’ cannot be separated At this point we are 
not ready to discuss ‘matter’. This will be considered further on in this work 
(see Chapters XL and XLI) 

The above formulae have also a very important physical and experimental 
meaning, as they introduce the ‘contact’ methods into our language Our 
actual measurements of ‘space’ and ‘time’ are strictly connected with readings 
on some instruments, and involve therefore coincidences between pointers and 
‘simultaneity’. In all instances the finite v elocity of propagation of signals must 
be taken into consideration hen our instrument, or the eye, is aflected by 
signals there is alwajs a delay due to the finite velocity of the propagation of 
the signals These delays are part and parcel of our experiment, and so our 
formulae must contain terms explicitly involv iiig this finite v'clocity of propaga- 
tion This innovation inv olv es not only a most profound structural epistemo- 
logical and semantic revolution but supplies the veiy factor that enables us to 
formulate more structurally satisfactory languages (theories), which LorenU^ 
Einstein, and Minkowski have produced.

658 IX. ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


We have been contrasting finite and ‘infinite’ velocities Let us say frankly 
that ‘infinite’ velocity is a polite ivay of speaking about blunders of observation 
‘Infinite’ velocity is meaningless Vclocit> is defined as v =i/t and if t is taken 
as zero or in other ords, if one of the fundamental factors in our definition is 
lacking, our definition ceases to define the term in question — in this case, velocitj 
So when the term ‘tune’ is lacking, we ha\e no velocity, by definition, so, to 
speak or speculate about ‘infinite’ velocity is simply making noises, and not 
saj ing ani thing The negative of this noise, namelj , sa> ing that \ elocity is not 
‘infinite’, or in a positu e sense, that velocity is ‘finite’, is on a different verbal 
footing, although it remains a polite invitation to stop talking non-sense. 

It should be noticed carefully that the general theory of Einstein is a high 
structural generalization of the special theory, and that both of them are 
generalizations of the classical mechanical principle of relativity It is founded, 
not on the introduction of any extraordinary structural assumptions, but on 
the elimination of some unjustified and false-as-to-facts structural assumptions, 
such as that of the ‘infinite’ velocity of light 

Both the theory of Einstein, and tlie theory presented in this work are long 
ov erdue The Einstein theory could have been formulated as soon as we dis- 
covered the finite velocity of light, in 1676 It should be noticed that this last 
discovery was also o\ erdue, as it did not require experiments to establish the 
finite velocity of light. It was suflfiaent to establish the meaningless character 
of ‘infinite’ velocity, which on symbolic grounds, could have been accomplished 
much earlier, and to conclude, that the veloaty of light must be finite This 
example shows the hampering, blocking, semantic effect which different mean- 
ingless verbal structures have on us To express this high and satisfactorj 
structural generalization, Emstem had to select the most general and struc- 
turally appropriate language in existence He chose at some stage of his work 
the language of £ and foiir-dimensional geometries in general and that of the 
differential geometry and the tensor calculus in particular In the latest field 
theory, Einstein and Mayer introduce a new more general and very revolutionary 
mathematical language where vectors and tensors in an n-dimensional spread 
may ha\ e m components 

At present it appears that two other very general mathematical disciplines 
will be used increasingly in the future. One of them is the theory of groups, the 
other is analysis situs. In the latter we study only these characteristics of figures 
that are unaffected (invariant) by continuous deformation produced without 
tearing Two structural points are relevant for us in this connection namely, 
that the analysis situs is fundamentally a differential and also an ordinal dis- 
cipline, based on asymmetrical relations In the next chapter, as an illustration 
of the actional, behaviouristic, functional, operational, differential, contact 
method a short account will be given of the way Einstein structurally treated 
‘simultaneity’. The elimination of the old structural dogma about ‘simul- 
taneity’ resulting from the semantic disturbance of objectification of ‘time’, is 
one of the outstanding achievements of Einstein and is historically the begin- 
ning of his theory. 



CHAPTER XXXVII 


ON THE NOTION OF 'SIMULTANEITV 

So we see that we cannot attach any absolute signification to the concept 
of simultaneity, but that two events which, viewed from a system of co- 
ordinates, are simultaneous, can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous 
events when envisaged from a system which is in motion relatively to that 
system, (iss) A einstein 

In the older days we accepted as self-evident the structural assumption 
that there is sense in such a statement as that an event A on the sun was ‘simul- 
taneous’ with an e\ ent B on the earth We assumed also that the ‘moments of 
our consciousness' had a universal 'meaning' We tacitly assumed, for instance, 
that when we saw or photographed an event on the sun, that it happened just 
the moment w'e saw it Such structural assumptions were rudely disturbed by 
the discovery of the finite velocity of light Today we know that when we see 
or photograph an e\ ent on the sun, that event happened approximately eight 
minutes earlier, as it takes about eight minutes for the light from the sun to 
reach our earth We begin to realize that the moments of our perceptions hat e 
no universal significance 

We inquire first what we mean structurally by simultaneity We do not 
need to go into details The application of functional and contact methods, 
even in the rough, will assist us We can speak in terms of instruments For 
instance, we can build a special, very fast moting picture camera, C, with two 
lenses D and E, at two oppiosite sides, and a calibrated film, F, running rapidl) 
through the middle of the camera as shown in Fig 1. If we focus our double 
camera on two flashes, A and B, occurring at ‘equal distances’, L, from the film, 
we say that the flashes occur simultane- 
ously by definition if the pictures, a and 
b of the flashes A and B, appear exactly 
opposite each other on the film, or if we 
have one picture If, under the condi- 
tions of the experiment, where the dis- 
tances between the origins of the flashes 
and the film are equal, and our film is 
moving very rapidly, the pictures of the 
flashes do not occur exactly opposite 
each other, but one picture is separated 
from the other, then we have two 
pictures, and conclude, by definition, 
that the flashes are ml simultaneous 

We introduce this hypothetical instrument to show that, in discussing 
physics, and the theory of Einstein in physics, we do not speak of ‘psychology’ 
or personal ‘subiectivity’, but that we do deal with the inherent physical sub- 

659 




660 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


iectwity of the instruments and the finite velocity of propagation When xie 
discuss the psyrho-logical or methodological or semantic significance of science 
and scienUfic method, we deal with different subjects 

When we use the term ‘observer' we mean an observer so equipped that he 
can do whatever is demanded of him. 

What was said about the definition of ‘simultaneity’ by the aid of the 
camera, applies also to ourselves 

The problem of prime importance before us is to find out if ‘simultaneit> ', 
as defined, has an ‘absolute’ and universal significance, or if it is perhaps a 
private and relative notion 

We will carry out the analysis in two wa>s, the first by example, which 
will be instructive, though perhaps not completely conclusive, the other, by 
the use of the Lorentz-Einstein transformation 

Let us perform our last experiment, which, with modern methods seems to 
be feasible, m a slightly more complicated form 

We can select a dark night in w Inch 
flashes will photograph well even at 
considerable distances We can place 
powerful projectors at A and B, and we 
place our camera so that the film will 
come exactly at C, midway between A 
and B We can start the mechanism of 
the rapidly moving film and, by an 
electrical contact made at C, we can 
produce a short flash from each of the 
two projectors. Because of the assump- 
tions, AC=CB, and equal velocity of 
the propagation of electrical currents 
and light-wav es in all directions we shall 
have by the structural definitions vv hich 
condition the experiment, one picture 
in Fig 2, say at the spot of our mov ing 
film marked by 5 The rays of light from 
A and B would arriv e ‘simultaneous!) ’ — 
that IS, ‘at the same tune’ — and w ould 
affect our moving film in one spot Oui 
definition was for a stationary observ er, 
and under the conditions, the experi- 
ment was fairly definite — all the under- 
lying structural assumptions, of course, 
being taken for granted 
Now consider an observer, as shown in Fig 3, moving uniformly in the 
direction from A to B. 

Let us assume that he is also equipped with a similar sort of moving picture 
camera as the stationary observer, and that just before he passes the point C 






SIMULTANEITY 


661 


the electrical impulse to the projectors is sent Let us assume further that the 
mark 5 on his moving film is exactly at the focal point of the camera as C is 
passed The electrical impulses trat elling from C to A and B would travel the 
distance AC = BC, produce the flashes A and B which again would travel with 
finite velocity in all directions During the inter\ al these impulses and light- 
iva\ es are trat elling, our obsert er is mot ing from A toward B, and spot 5 on his 
moting film is no more at the focus of the camera Obviously he will meet the 
light-wate from B first, at C', let us say, when mark 6 on his film is at the focus 
(Fig 3) After another short intertal when he reaches C" and mark 7 on his 
film IS at the focus, the light-wave from A otertakes him (Fig 4) 

So tte see that uhat was ‘simultaneous’ (by definition) and produced one 
impression on the moving film of the stationary observer, was not ‘simultaneous’, 
(again by definition), for the mot mg observer, as hts film registers iioo pictures 
As both observers use similar instruments and one set of definitions, ob- 
viously both are entitled to claim that their records on the film are conclusive. 
So the first can claim that the flashes were ‘simultaneous’, the second can claim 
that they were not ‘simultaneous’. The reverse is equally true If the moving 
observer had one picture, and claimed ‘simultaneity’, the stationary observer 
would have ivoo pictures, and deny ‘simultaneity’. 

But when two observers are equally justified in making two opposing claims 
where, by their very meanings, there is only one possible, we must conclude 
that the claim itself is meaningless. We see that ‘absolute simultaneity’ is a 
fiction and impossible to ascertain, as it would depend on some impossible 
‘absolute motion’, or ‘infinite velocity’ of propagation of signals 

The analytical form of showing the impossibility of ‘absolute simultaneity’ 
IS very simple, and follow^s directly from the Loren tz- Einstein transformation. 

Let us imagine two observers, one in an S system of co-ordinates (.r, y, z, t) 
and another in an S' system of co-ordinates (v', y', z', t') moving relatively w ith 
the velocity v 

Let us assume two ev^ents happening in the unprimed system at the point 
(*- 1 , yi, 2i) at the ‘time’ ti, and the other at the point yi, Zi) at the ‘time’ /j. 
According to the Lorentz-Einstein transformation the ‘times’ at which the two 
events occur relatively to the primed s> stem are given by the for mulae 
ti'=0 (/i — Viw/c®), h' (fj — V 2 i’/c'), w'here as usual |3 = l/Vl —v^/c- 
If we assume that in our unprimed system S the two events were ‘simul- 
taneous’, which means that they ‘occurred at the same time’, h would be equal 
to h, that is, /i=/ 2 , or fi— (2=0 Let us find the difference between the two 
primed ‘times’ in the moving system S', and see if this difference is zero, which 
would mean that the primed ‘limes’ are equal. 

Returning to our formulae which give us the values for the primed system 
‘times’, we express their difference as 

t\-h'=0 -/3 (ti-h+Xiv/c^-Xiv/c^). (1) 

But we assumed (i — (2 =0, therefore h’ —h' =/3 {xiv/c^—xiv/c^). 

This last formula shows clearly that (i ' — W cannot be zero , or in other words, 
h' cannot be equal to t^ unless *1 =V 2 . 



662 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


The two events which, for an observer in the unpnmed system, happen 
‘simultaneously’, =h, or h —h =0) at different places, (or Vi not equal to ar 2 , 
cannot be ‘simultaneous’ for the mo\ing observer m the primed sys- 
tem 5', but will happen at different ‘times’ (fi' is not equal to ij', or h' —h' 9^0). 

It IS extremely instructive to consider further what happens in measuring 
‘times' and ‘lengths’ in systems which are moving relatively to each other. 

If, in the equation (1) abov e, we assume vi =Xi, this means that both events 
occur at one place in the stationary unpnmed system 5 

By changing the signs and cancelling the terms with ri and xj, which are 
equal and of opposite signs, w-e have h' —h' ih—h) whence, substituting 
for its value 1 /"n/ 1 we obtain 

h ~h 

This last formula brings out a few remarkable issues In terrestrial velocities 
the square of the velocity of the motion of the observer in the primed s> stem 
S’ is very small as compared with the square of the velocity of light c^, so the 
fraction v^/c^ is small, Vi-d-/c^ differs very little from unity but the whole 
denominator is less than unity, and so h' ~h' Js not equal to h—ti, but greater 
In other words, the interval of ‘time’ between the two events appears 
larger to the observ er in the primed moving system than to the observer in the 
stationary unpnmed system In general, among all systems in a state of uni- 
form relative motion, that one m which two events occur at one place, is char- 
acterized by the fact that the ‘time’ interv al between the two events appears 
shortest to an observer in this system The shortest interv'al means that to an 
observer in the system, the events run their course most rapidly A process 
which, with reference to a given system, occurs in one place, appears to run its 
course most rapidly to an observer in that system, but more slowly to a moving 
observ er in any other sy stem 

The more rapid the relative motion, the slower the process will appear, 
and, in the limit, if an observer could move with the velocity of light, w*=c-, 
the denominator of our equation would become 1 — 1=0 and k' —h' would 
become ‘infinite’ and all events would be at a standstill 

As the formulae for length, x and x', involv'e the ‘times’ and, as we sec, 
the intervals of ‘time’ arc dependent on the relative velocities, by a similar 
process of reasoning w e find that the standards of length are also relative, and 
that the length L' in the primed system is represented by L' =L\/l—v'^ fc-. 
In other words, to an observer who secs the rod in motion, it will appear 
‘shortened’, and among all systems in a state of uniform relative motion, the 
one in which the rod is at rest is distinguished from all others by the fact that 
in It the rod appears longer than in any other system For instance, a metre 
rod ly ing on the earth in the direction of its motion would appear to an observ er 
on the sun to be shortened by 5 xl0“’ cm In the limit, when ii=c, the fraction 
= 1, 1—1 =0and L'=0, which means that to an observer moving with the 
velocity of light, a three-dimensional body would appear as two-dimensional, 



SIMULTANEITY 


663 


or a two-dimensional figure as one-dimensional The co-ordinates y and 2, as 
ive have seen, do not enter into consideration as they are equal in both systems 
moving relati\elj m the X direction, and the ‘time’ co-ordinates are inde- 
pendent of them. 

If a body at rest appears to the obsener in the unprimed s>stem as a 
sphere, it will appear as an oblate spheroid to an obser\er in the primed sjstem 
We see that structurally not only ‘simultaneitj ’ and ‘time’ are not ab- 
solute but also that length, and therefore shape, is relatiie 

We have seen that the ‘shortest’ and ‘longest’ \ allies arc important char- 
acteristics of the motion This suggests why in the general theorj of Einstein 
we are interested in, and introduce, gcodetics 

It should be mentioned here that the Lorentz transformation has been 
reached by difficult considerations involving MaxweU's electromagnetic field 
equations, unrelated to the Einstein theory Einstein found the Lorentz trans- 
formation by the simplest consideration connected with his theory' The finding 
of such important equations by two methods, entirely different structiirallj , 
must be considered as a convincing proof of the fundamental importance of 
such formulae, the more so since they follow from very simple and fundamental 
structural principles which in themselves cannot be denied because they are 
negative in character Negative statements are on a different fooling in the 
new systems, they follow structurally from a A onentation, just as the older 
positive dogmas were the structural results of aristotelianism and the delusional 
results of identification 

The facts mentioned concerning the measures of length and the behaviour 
of clocks do not presen t any paradoxes They simpl> say that these discrepancies 
are mutual and inevitable, as any measurement is only a measuiement when 
It can be registered by an instrument, or seen, or recorded in some v\aj If the 
measuring rods and clocks are moving relatively to us, what we see or what 
our instruments record is not what is happening on the moving system, which 
no one can see or record from outside the system What 
reaches us is simply what the light-waves or other signals 
moving with finite v elocity (and therefore retarded by a 
motion away from us) bring to us As all existing methods 
of communication and all known signals ha^c finite veloci- 
ties, these structural differences which are conditioned by 
the inherent characteristics of the world should be taken 
into consideration in modern science 

If we draw a square ABCD (Fig 5) and an 
aviator E were to pass this square sign with a velocity 
of 161,000 miles a second* in the direction AB, 

*I deliberately select such a velocity so as to make the contraction given by the 
formula L' = LVl — 1/2 With this aim we must make the fraction repre- 

sented by i//c’' = 3/4, then 1 — 3/4 = 1/4 and Vl/4=l/2 We find the square of 
our velocity v by taking 3/4 of the square of the velocity of light iA=. and 
find 11 = 5X^ = 161,000 miles a second

he would see — and any instrument carried by him would register it — the sides 
of our square {AB=BC=CD=DA) in the direction of his flight, namely AB 
and CD, as ‘contracted’ to half their length If he turned at right angles, the 
sides AB and CD would ‘expand’ and the other sides, which are at right angles, 
BC and DA, would ‘contract’. For us the sides AB and BC are equal, for him 
one appears twice the other To him our square appears oblong 

Under such natural structural conditions it is a fundamental fallacy to 
ascribe to ‘lengths’ or ‘shapes’ or ‘times’ any ‘absolute’ significance If we grasp 
the structural Let that ‘length’ and ‘duration’ are not things inherent in the 
external world, nor are ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’, but that they appear as 
relations between e^ ents and some specified observer, and forms of representa- 
tions, then all paradoxes would disappear 

A suggestion which concerns visuahzation may be helpful If we realize 
the structural fact that words are not the objects they represent, we shall alw a> s 
discriminate automatically between what we see, feel , on the level of lower 
order abstractions, and what we say on the level of higher order abstractions 
When we have conquered that single difficulty we could ne\er then identify 
the two different orders of abstractions. We would e\aluate the terms ‘matter’, 
‘space’, and ‘time’ as forms of representation, and non-objects, and we w ould 
describe e\ ents in a functional, operational, behaviouristic language of order 
If we realize and feel the finite velocity of propagation of all processes, we may 
\isualize all that has been explained here Diagrammatizing and even follow- 
ing with one's hand, the visualized order of occurrences, helps enormously Try 
to visualize how the atiator in the last example is flying away and how much 
more slowly the light impressions from the earth are reaching him or his in- 
struments, and the difficulties will soon vanish 

We shall also be greatly helped in our power of \ isualization when we 
become acquainted -with the structure of the Minkowski four-dimensional 
world. An explanation of this appears in the next chapter. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII 


ON THE ‘WORLD’ OF MINKOWSKI 


Moreover, the really fundamental things have a way of appearing to be 
simple once they have been stated by a genius, who was m this case Min- 
kowski (431) G V RAINICH 


We have already freely used the structural term ‘dimension’ and only 
hinted at its meanings Before we approach the Minkowski world we must 
summarize roughly what for our purpose we should know about dimensions 
There is nothing mysterious about the term ‘dimension’ First of all, the 
dimensionality of a manifold is not inherent in the manifold as such It is a 
characteristic of order and so of structure A manifold can be ordered m different 
ways, so that it follows that one manifold may have different dimcn5ionalit> , 
depending on how we order it 

A manifold which has linear order and structure is called one-dimensional 
A two-dimensional manifold is then a linearly ordered manifold of linearly 
ordered manifolds , 

Usually we speak about our 'space' of daily experiences as a three- 
dimensional manifold, but this is true only with reference to points, and not 
true with reference to lines or spheres The manifold of all spheres in ‘space’ 
is, for instance, a four-dimensional manifold, so also is a manifold of lines 
Let us explain the line-dimensionality of our ‘space’ in terms of lines. 
A line can be given by two points — one, let us sa>, in the floor of our room, 
the other in the ceiling Each of these points is given by two co-ordinates. 
It has two degrees of freedom, and so our ‘space’ is a four-dimensional (2x2) 
manifold %n hnes This means that to distinguish any line in our ‘space’ from 
any other line we would have to have four data Similarly, if we deal with 
spheres, a manifold made up of spheres requires four data, three for locating 
the centre and one giving the radius of the sphere. The above examples, of 
course, do not exhaust the structural possibilities ‘ 

The term ‘dimension’ does not apply solely to what we call ‘space’ The 
term applies to any manifold which we can order in some particular wa> 
Manifolds or aggregates abound everywhere in our lives The domain of 
colours, for instance, is a manifold, and so is the domain of tone, or of re- 
membrances , No manifold in itself has any dimensionality To ascribe 
dimensionality to the manifold we must first order it and the number of its 
dimensionality, or its ascribed or discovered structure, may differ according 
to the principle of ordering used 

In discussing dimensionality we have two purposes First, to dispel the 
semantic fright about this simple term, and, second, to suggest means for 
msuahzation, which for our purpose are of great neurological importance 

When we say that the world is structurally a four-dimensional manifold, 
we mean only that according to our experience and the structure of our nervous 

665 



666 IX. ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


system, tlie world of our e\perience is represented by a fourfold order We can 
order the events as to the right and to the left, forward and backward, up and 
down, and sooner and later In our experience this fourfold order is completely 
united, and cannot be separated unless we deliberately choose to neglect some 
of these orderings 

Nor does it mean that all these dimensions are ‘identical’ We are accus- 
tomed, for instance, to consider the three dimensions of ‘space’ as ‘identical’, 
or at least cqui\alent Is this true in life? Can we disregard, for instance, the 
structural difference between i eriical and horizontal? If we did, quite probably, 
as Eddington remarks, we should come to an untimely end, and break our necks 

ObMouslj if we visuahce our plenum, as made up of lines or particles, bj 
necessity we visualize structurallj a four-dimensional manifold It should be 
noticed that a four-dimensional ‘absolute void’, or ‘absolute nothingness’, 
besides being non-sense, cannot be Msualized at all, because it could ha\e 
no stnicliirc 

We see that all metaphysical ‘fouith dimensions’ are not only non-sense, 
but usually indicate a pathological semantic disturbance The intensity of 
such disturbances is often high, because it is entirely impossible for a sane 
person to deal with such meaningless noises The victim is obsessed with 
attempts to do the impossible, — a semantically hopeless and painful task 

Such objectifications of terms are very dangerous and science should try , 
by proper emphasis, to eliminate them Outside of science the term ‘dimension’ 
has no meaning and ought to be defimtely abandoned in our speculations, 
for the sake of sanity 

The notion of ‘time’ as a ‘fourth dimension’ is by no means new It 
appeared in a lague form centuries ago The notion however was not formu- 
lated properly, and therefore was unworkable Instead of helping science. 
It only hindered it 

Inspired by Einstein’s w'ork, the mathematician Minkowski, whose work 
had been mainly in the theory of numbers, began to work at the theory of 
manifolds of any number of dimensions In 1908 he delivered his famous and 
semantically epoch-making address on Space and Time which fused geometry 
and physics structurally In this address he insisted that the connection between 
‘space’ and ‘time’ as given by the Lorentz-Einstein formulae is not accidental 
but e\hibits that inner connection or structure to which we had not paid 
enough attention ^ 

In our experience, ‘space’ and ‘time’ can never be entirely separated, as 
already explained, and so Minkowski combined them into a higher entity which 
IS called the ‘Minkowski world’ In the world of experience the datum appears 
to be, not a place and a point of ‘time’, but the event or the world point — that is, 
a place at a definite date 

The graphic picture of a moving point is a world-line Rectilinear uniform 
motion corresponds then to a straight world-line, accelerated motion, to one 
that is curved

The event is the most elementary notion We shall use it from now on. in 
this work in the sense of a four dimensional \olume of space-time which is 
small in all four dimensions AA’e do not posit whether e\ents themselves ha^e 
structure or not, but it is preferable to assume that they ha^ e no space-time 
structure, which means that the event has no parts which are external to each 
other in space-time The order of events is fourfold, as previously shown 
The aggregate or manifold of all point-events is then called the world 
The point-events are given by four numbers representing the co-ordinates, 
three giving the ‘space’ co-ordinates, and the fourth the ‘time’ co-ordinate 
The term ‘space-time continuum’ or ‘space-time manifold’ is used often 
and implies that the numbers v, y, z, t, are to vary continuously 

In such a space-time continuum all happenings are structurally the inter- 
sections of world-lines, and if we could describe the world-lines of all points 
of the universe we would have a full account of the universe, ‘past’ and ‘future’ 
We see that all physics, with the rest of our problems, must then be considered 
as a chapter of the general structural and semantic study of continuous mani- 
folds of four dimensions 

But we are already acquainted with such theories For instance, the 
internal theory of surfaces may be considered as a part of the subject in t\\ o 
and three dimensions We have seen that different surfaces are characterized 
by the expression for the line element ds^ +2giid'Cid.\i+giid.\,2^, or by 

that group of transformations which leaves the line element invariant V\’e 
know already that in the E as well as ncinannian geometries we have similar 
expressions and characteristic transformations 

If physics IS to be considered a branch of the theory of four-dimcnsional 
manifolds, we should naturally look for some such transformations The mani- 
fold represents the world, the generalized* theory of relativity gives the desired 
answer. Minkowski proposed a postulate, which he calls the postulate of an 
absolute world, or the world-postulate which asserts the invariance of all the laws 
of nature in relation to linear transformations, for which the function 
IS invariant 

The reader is already familiar with the expression \-+y^, which gives 
the invariant length in E geometry in two dimensions, and v--l-y"-j-s* which 
gives it in three dimensions It would be natural to expect that in four dimen- 
sions we should have an expression of the type x'+y'+z^+t^ but in this case 
our expression is x^+y-+z^ —cH'‘ It should be noticed that the above dilTcrcnt 
types of expressions have different origins The first two arise in pure geometrj , 
and the last has its roots in ph>sics The problem was to bring an experimental 
expression into harmony with a familiar geometrical expression Minkowski 
introduced the expression tct = iii, where i is as usual the square root of minus 
one, (1=^ — 1 ) Then of course —A* becomes {ictY=u^ 

*I use the term ‘generalized’ to embrace the unified field theory and eventually 
the quantum theory, although, for our purpose, I utilize only the special and gen- 
eral theory

If We change the lettering, and denote v=mi, y = iii, z=m then our 
expression x-+y^+s^—cH^ becomes a simple formula for 

distance in four-dimensional geometr> It would not be profitable for us to 
speculate upon this substitution, it was mtroduced merely for the sake of 
mathematical, verbal treatment and can be easily translated back into the 
usual terms of c and t 

We have already seen that the expression v® +y- +z- — +y'-+z'- —cH'^ 
is invariant under the Lorentz-Einstein transformation This fact of invariance 
is fundamental, and it is well to convince ourselves that it is so The Lorentz- 
Einstein transformation was v' =0(x—vt), yf =y, 2 '=z, /'=j8(/— vv/c)^ where 
j3 = l/Vl— As the co-ordinates y and z are equal in both s> stems, we 
can disregard them, and verify that =cH-—v‘^ Let us substitute for t' 

and x' the values given by the Lorentz-Einstein transformation We have then:

as, for instance, a momentary spark, which has the co-ordinates Vi, j’l, zi, t\, in 
one system of co-ordinates, say S, and let another event-particle occur in that 
system at aj, yj, sj, /j, that the formulae remain invariant If we designate 
the distance between the two events by r, its value would be given by 
= ( 1 C 2 - Ai)H (3'2 -3'i)’‘ + (= 2 -siy 

In a different system, 5', moving uniformly relatively to 5, r'* w'ould in 
general not be equal to r^, but the expression —c-ih—li)- would be equal 
to r'^-c^{t 2 '-hr. r“-c=(/ 2 -/i) 2 =r' 2 -cW-<i')’' 

The abov'e expression is called the tnterval and expresses a most funda- 
mental structural characteristic, namely, that the interval is invariant for all 
systems in uniform relative motion This result is quite general and independent 
of the relative orientation of the axes, or of the angle the velocity has to the 
axes The interval plays m the theory of Einstein a similar role which the 
Pythagorean rule played in the E geometry 

Because of the finite velocity of our measuring signals, our formulae must 
involve finite velocity Therefore the interval is the only actual measurement 

which we can ever 
make in practice 
Hence its funda- 
mental semantic 
importance

ON THE ‘WORLD* OF MINKOWSKI 


669 


The expression ct, where c is the velocity of light, 300,000 kilometres per 
second, gives us the distance tra\elled by light in the ‘lime ’ t It is natural to 
regard the velocity of light, which is a constant and translates easily into the 
language of length, as a unit of 'time' In the Minkowski world it is customary', 
because of its convenience, to regard 1 second as the equivalent of 300,000 
kilometres and measure lengths or ‘times' in seconds or kilometres indis- 
criminately 

Let us imagine a scale graduated in kilometres, and clocks whose faces 
are also graduated in kilometres (1/300,000 of a second) If the clocks are 
set correctly and we look at them from A the sum of the reading of any clock 
and the scale division beside it is one for all because the scale reading giies 
the correction for the ‘time’ taken by light, travelling with unit velocity , to 
reach A 

If we lay the scale in line with the two events and note the clock and scale 
readings, <i and X\, of the first event, and the corresponding readings, tt and \2, 
of the second event, then where s represents the ‘interval’ 

mentioned above 

If we set the scale moving in the direction AB then the divisions would 
ha^e advanced to meet the second e\ent and the difference (r 2 — xi) would be 
smaller. But this is compensated, because (^2 —h) also becomes altered When A 
is adx ancing to meet the light coming from any of the clocks on the scale the 
light arrives too quickly, and the reading of the clock appears smaller. 

The net result is, roughly, that it does not matter what uniform motion 
IS gl\ en to the scale, the final results for the interval s are always equal ® 

We can now understand the vital importance of the minus sign with the 
‘time’ co-ordinate In fact, if in our equations all the signs were plus, using 
the ‘space’ and ‘time’ of one observer, one value of s would be obtained, but 
using the ‘space’ and ‘time’ of another observer, a different value would be 
obtained. With the minus sign for the ‘time’ co-ordinate, we see that we can 
have values of s which are equal for all observers If the distances increase, 
the ‘time’ element increases also, and so the difference may not be changed, 
but with the positive sign this would not be the case 

We see that the interv al s represents something which concerns only the 
events under consideration The corresponding entity in ordinary geometry 
IS distance, which is independent of the accidental choice of co-ordinates. The 
minus sign makes the geometry of space-time non-euclidean 

To familiarize ourselv'es with what has been already explained about 
simultaneity and the geometry of space-time, we will work it out once more, 
but now by the Minkowski method 

It will be enough to use two dimensions, one represented on the X axis, 
the other on the T axis Let us consider three points A, B, C, at rest in our 
system O on the X axis (Fig 2) In our space-time they will be represented 
by three parallels to the T axis Let C be midway between A and B so that 
AC = CB Let us assume that light signals are sent in both directions from C 
at the moment t =0 We assume that the system is ‘at rest’, which means that 



670 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 



the light signals propagate themselves to the right and to the left with equal 
velocities Hence we can represent them by straight lines equally inclined 
to the X axis These lines are called ‘light-lines' 

The points A', B' which are the inter- 
section of the ‘world-lines' of the points A 
and B with the light-lines gi\e us the ‘times' 
at which the signals arrive It follows from 
the drawing that A'B' is parallel to the X 
axis, which means that A' and B' are 'simul- 
taneous* (equal ‘times') ' 

Let us now take another case in which 
our points j4, B, C, move uniformly with an 
equal velocity (Fig. 3) '^heir world-lines 
will also be parallel to each other but inclined to the avis In the drawing the 
hght-lines will be represented by similar lines but their intersections with the 
world-lines of A and B will not be on a parallel to the X axis, and so they w ill 
not be simultaneous J 

We should notipe that an obscri er 
who moved with the system in the dii cc- 
tion OX' would be perfectly entitled to 
claim that A' and B' are stmultaneous to 
him His co-ordinate system would be 
OX'V, m which the points A' and B' 
are on a parallel to his X' axts as he is at 
rest in his system OX'T' The world- 
lines yl, B, C, are parallel to the T' a\is 
because the points are supposed to be at 
rest in this system and hence the v's 
have equal values for all /'s 

An important point should be noticed, namel^Li that we have only one 
space-time and that the indefinitely numerous waA different observers par- 
tition their 'space' and ‘time' represent merely the iiidefinitely many ways in 
which it can be partitioned If we keep the whole of it under consideration we 
see that we cannot divide it into 'space' and 'time', as any subdivision has both 
aspects ^ 



The Minkowski method of representation makes the change in our measure- 
ments of length, as given by the Lorentz-Einstein transforination, very obvious 
A measuring rod is not purely a ‘spatial' configuration, as m the actual 
world such a thing does not exist, but it is a space-time configuration 

Every point of the rod exists at each moment of 'time' We see that in 
space-time we cannot represent our rod as a segment on the X axis but must 
repiesent it structurally as a stnp in the XT plane We assume here for sim- 
plicity that the rod is one-dimensional (Fig 4) 

A rod which is at rest in a system is represented by a strip parallel to the 
T axis. If it IS moving, its strip is inclined to the T axis. The ‘contraction’ does

not affect the stnp at all but it is rather a section cut our of the A" axis In 
actual experience, it is only the stnp as a manifold of world points which has 
physical tcaiiiy, and not the cross sections, which, as ne see, are not equal on 
different axes. The ‘contraction is not a 
change in pin sical realitx ’ but meriK a con- 
sequence of our way of regarding things \\ e

the 'contraction' la real' or apparent’ is 
based on a misunderstanding Born gi\ cs an 
excellent example If xi e slice a cucumber in 
different directions it is tallacious to argue 
that the smallest slice xi hich is perpendicular

oblique slices onh 'apparent' Simdarh in 
the Einstein theorx , a rod has xanous lengths Fic 4 

according to the motion of the obserxer 

One of these lengths the static length, is the greatest, but it is no more 'real 
than any other Similar remarks can be made about ‘time 

Attenuon should be gixen to one extremelj important semantic point 
concerning the Minkowski four-dimcnsional world We already know that for 
our nen ous sx stems the passing from dx namic to static, and x'lce x ersa, is a 
most xital strucrural problem The first step of this translation has alreadx 
been gixen in the notion of the xariable The calculus earned it a step further 
In the Mmkoxx'ski xx-orld we reach the complete solution of the problem 

.^s Kejser points out m his Mathematical Philosophy xxe had txxo xerlial 
methods of dealing xxith ‘time’ One was the method of Xexxton, the method 
of the structural importation of time' From the objectixe d> namic xiorid of 
the loxxer order abstractions ‘time' is imported into the static world of the 
higher order abstractions We import it xxith motion' xxe sax things ‘mox'e'. 
Such language is struciurallx unsatisfactorx-, exen on the earlier lex-el of our 
dexelopment It hampers analysis, and is contrarj to the structure and function 
of the human nervous sjstem It breeds tremendous metarhysical impasses, 
and is ultimately based on semantic disturtiances due to identincation 

If we introduce dj namic, shitting entiues into static higher order abstrac- 
tions, rationality is impossible and xve drift toxxard mysticism 

A X'erj' real semantic problem appears here \\e want to gixe the best 
possible account of the structurally dynamic world around us- yet our higher 
order abstractions are structurally stater, and for their pro{)er xxorking they 
must use static means. Here seemed to be an impasse xx-hich for milleniums 
had defied solution ‘Philosophers' of different schools were preaching and 
teaching that w-e should nexer be able to be ‘raticnal* and understand this 
world and ourselxes Anti-mtellectual schools began to floun-h, to the be- 
wilderment of all 

The issue, after all, was simple, the moment some one discoxered and 
stated it. We did not need to change either the world around us ur ourselxes; 




672 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


we simply had to discover a structurally new method of dealing with the c sque 
problems without changing them 

The new method is given by Einstein and Minkowski Instead of making 
the static world of higher order abstractions dynamic, which cannot be done 
at all without producing semantic disturbances, they invented structural 
methods for dealing with the dynamic world by static means The key was 
found in the handling of the troublesome factor, ‘time’ Minkowski decided to 
put ‘time’ in its proper place by introduang the structurally new four-dimen- 
sional world 

In the case of particle P, we habitually used to say that the point P at 
an instant t was at a ‘space’ point (at, y, z) At the instant /' it was at the point 
(c'l y', z') , . We always needed four numbers, which gave us the where and 
when in respect to some frame of reference 

As we have seen, Minkowski decided to look structurally at this tetrad 
of four numbers (v, y, z, t) ‘as-a-whole’. In other words, he placed himself on 
a higher level of abstraction He took under consideration the older results, 
combined them, and called the combination by one single name, the 'world 
point’ Such a world point has also four numbers (not 3 plus 1, but just 4) 

A world made up of such points is a four-dimensional world in which all the 
points co-e\ist The fluv of the lower order abstractions and ‘time’ is abolished 
There is no more ‘motion’ in a ‘flow of time’. In such a world the term ‘where’ 
has completer structural meanings, it has absorbed the when If we ask, where 
in such a world the particle P is, we answer, at the point (v, y, z, t) Where is 
the particle R'i’ At the point (v', y', z', /') 

We see that the particles of such a world are never ‘the mme’ , they do not 
‘change’ or ‘pass’, they co-exist, and all is static In this way the three-dimen- 
sional dynamics become four-dimensional statics 

It should be noticed that we are now dealing with a language of new struc- 
ture, uniquely befitting the structure and function of our nervous system Of 
course we have altered nothing in the world around us The example of the 
moving picture and the static film as given before is an excellent example 
of this structural innovation 

The fact that in this new world nothing repeats itself because it has a 
different date, unless the time-lmes are closed, has very far-reaching conse- 
quences, of which we have already spoken and which we will analyse in more 
detail later on. 



CHAPTER XXXIX 


GENERAL REFLECTIONS ON THE EINSTEIN THEORY 


For, beyond the bounds of science, too, objective and relative reflection 
IS a gain, a release from prejudice, a liberation of the spirit from standards 
whose claim to absolute validity melts away before the critical judgment 
of the relativist (4S] max born 


It is extremely instructive to follow the elements of identification as they 
appear in the evolution of the Einstein theory. 

We know that the results of the Michelson experiment which disclosed that 
light is propagated in all directions with equal velocities for all observers, 
irrespective of their relative velocities, could not be reconciled with the older 
mechanics These results disturbed the physicists profoundly and attempts 
were made to solve this apparent impasse In what follows we shall have to 
analyse incidentally the actnities of some of our great scientists, men who 
have added enormously to our knowledge, and this fact should be appreciated 
What we have to say is not intended as criticism — far from it — but simply as a 
structural and a semantic analysis 

The feeling that we objectify unduly and that we should not use a language 
of ‘is’ of identity, but that we should use an actional, behaviouristic, functional, 
operational language and methods, is not new in science, although the need 
was not formulated structurally, it is true, and therefore it never became a 
workable foundation The main successes in these fields W'ere rather accidental, 
and were the personal prerogatives of those few men w'hose psycho-logical 
make-up urged them to achieve Objectification, which as we know, is a se- 
mantic ascribing of objective existence and values to terms, was bound to make 
Its appearance somewhere. 

This struggle against identification is apparent in all science, but it will 
suffice to point out the most striking example in the relation of the works of 
Lorentz and Einstein Lorentz objectified, Einstein did not We here come 
across a tremendous semantic fact which has tp do with the tnterpretation of 
mathematical formulae. Lorentz on elaborate and difficult grounds, connected 
with Maxwell's field equations, produced what is usually called the Lorentz 
transformation He gave it an objectified interpretation Einstein introduced 
an entirely different fundamental interpretation of the structural principle in- 
volved The formulae look alike but they now have different and very simple 
meanings. 

Hertz, whose epoch-making discoveries made wireless possible, advocated 
long ago what is termed the phenomenological point of view, which m our 
language is approximately the actional, behav louristic, operational, functional 
language and method. In his writings he implicitly refused to use the vicious 

673 


43 



674 IX ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


term 'is’ of ‘identity’, and so to objectify his terms, which refusal in pictureiue 
language he expressed as a refusal to legislate about ‘essences’ ^ 

The old E and N language of 'absolute space’ and ‘absolute emptiness’ 
were for a long while structurally unsatisfactory Physicists felt that somehow 
they could not deal with it, but it never occurred to them that this ‘absolute 
nothingness' is ob]ecti\ ely meaningless, and that therefore no one can possibl> 
deal with it Not knowing that, they politely called this non-sense a 'meta- 
physical question’ and evaded issues by leaving the solution in the hands of 
‘philosophers’, never to be solved 

By now I hope that the reader is quite aware that meaningless problems 
cannot be solved by any one, and that there are no such things as flie/a-physical 
questions. There may, however, be a question about enlarging the domain of 
physics 

Being forced to abandon this 'absolute emptiness’, physicists went to the 
other extreme and postulated some kind of 'material’ ether Let us note that 
such a postulate involves structurally the 'is’ of identity and objectification. 
Lorentz in opposition to Heitz postulated an 'ether’ which was ‘motionless’ in 
‘absolute space’. Note that here we have a perfect example of structural ob- 
jectification of terms 'Absolute space' is for him semantically some kind of 
'absolute emptiness’, which, not being satisfactory for the physicist, is filled 
with some ‘material’, ‘motionless’ ether. ‘Motionless’ is itself an objectification 
of language, as such a term has here no physical or objective meanings at all 

In pursuing the speculations on objectified terms (semantic disturbances) 
it was natural to expect, as the earth is not at rest with respect to the sun, the 
other planets , that some ‘ether wind’ or ‘ether drift’ should appear which 
would make the constant velocity of light impossible for observeis moving 
with different relative velocities But these structural expectations were not 
fulfilled The velocity of light, as shown by many experiments, was a constant 
for all observers The ‘motionless material ether’ also became structurally 
impossible, as might be expected, if we stop objectifving terms 

In 1892 FitzGerald suggested an objectified theory, assuming ‘absolute’ 
‘length’ and ‘time’ superior to measurement, which involve identification and 
do not allow the use of the actional, behav louristic, operational, functional 
attitudes, language, and methods FitzGerald assumed that every body ‘mov mg’ 
with the velocity v in the ‘ether’ is shortened in the direction of motion It 
should be noted that every mention of ‘shortening’ or ‘contraction’, presupposes 
some ‘absolute' standards of ‘rest’ or 'motion' or ‘length’, which do not, and 
cannot, e.xist outside of our skin, but are only semantic disturbances, inside 
our skin, which occur when we identify and ascribe objective existence and value 
to terms 

How deeply and completely these objectifications permeate our daily and 
scientific lives is best shown again in the case of Lorentz Even in 1917, in his 
Haarlem lectures, he expressed structural hopes that a ‘matenal’, ‘substantial’ 
ether can be preserved, that ‘space’ and ‘time’ can be sharply separated, and 
that ‘simultaneity’ can have an absolute meaning 



REFLECTIONS ON THE EINSTEIN THEORY 675 


In the Theory of Relativity of Whitehead, and in some others writers who 
deal with the theory of Einstein, and particularly m all critics of Einstein, we 
find a similar objectification of terms 

They still feel the older E and N ‘absolute emptiness’, ‘absolute space’, 
‘absolute time’, to which terms they ascribe structural objectivity In such w orks 
the term ‘contraction’ is used frequently' 

Let me recall the mechanism of objectification If we do not reject c\- 
phcitly and implicitly the ‘is’ of identity, W'e automatically identify' different 
orders of abstractions and ascribe objective characteristics to terms Thus the 
term ‘time’ which represents a label for a feeling inside our skin, is gnen an 
obJectl^ e evaluation If ‘objective’ it must have a ‘property’ of 'simultaneity ’, 
a semantic process taken or er from comparing two objectit e sticks w hen the 
two ends are made to coincide On the objectn e external level, we never deal 
with ‘time’ but we simply compare processes When we select an arbitrary unit- 
process on the objective lev'el, whatever we might say that it ‘is’, well, it li not, 
and the difficulty is found exclusively in the use of the ‘is’ of identity 

If we abandon entirely the ‘is’ of identity, we stop objectification, we do 
not ascribe objective existence and v alues outside our skin, to terms and semantic 
reactions mside our skin But then of course we hav e to change the sinicliiic of 
our language, as otherwise the old s r will continue to play tricks on us An 
actional, operational, functional language of order is the structural solution of 
our semantic difficulty. 

If we objectify ‘space’ into ‘absolute space’, we must objectify it as ‘ab- 
solute emptiness’ for only such an ‘absolute space’ can be at ‘absolute rest’, 
that is, static in the E or N sense Similarly only objectified ‘time’ can have 
the ‘property’ of ‘absolute simultaneity’ 

If we realize that these 'absolutes’ are only the semantic objectifications of 
terms, (where the activities of the lower nerve centres are structurally ascribed 
to the activities of the higher nerve centres and vice versa), W'e begin to dif- 
ferentiate between different order abstractions, and to keep them differentiated 
In terms of our structurally new language we become ‘conscious of abstracting’, 
and then habitually and unconsciously use the behav louristic language and 
methods of order 

If we picture this ‘absolute emptiness’ or 'absolute nothingness' (which 
cannot be done successfully, as it has no meaning), and try to compare it with 
a plenum, or ‘fulness’ (a cloud of smoke, for instance), we see at once that only 
this ‘absolute emptiness’ can be static, homogeneous , a condition that is 
impossible with a dynamic fulness 

Perhaps we can now appreciate the tremendous semantic significance of 
the Einstein theory, which introduces structurally a non-objectijicd, human, 
sane attitude of proper evaluation toward this world We should not be sur- 
prised to find that a ^-system w'hich is an inevitable general structural con- 
comitant of the E and N systems of geometry and physics should formulate as 
a general structural and semantic tssne what the E and JV systems have done in 
their special fields, without such general formulation 



076 IX. ON K]\irmiCAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


From our structur.il point of mow there is no retreat, the Einstein ttork ts 
irret ersible. In the jommei scientists of today the non-objcctificd attitude 
toward terms of ‘space’ and ‘time’ is already an actomplished semantic fact, 
entircK independent of what future experiments may show For experiments 
can nc\er justify identifitation, and so can have no detrimental effect upon 
this fundamental and most beneficial structural, linguistic, and semantic revo- 
lution Our task w as to formulate these issues m general so as to make us 
conscious of them, and 1 assume that it is at this semantic point that the tre- 
mendous talue of Einstein's work will manifest itself in life. Indeed we shall 
see later on in this volume that the newer quantum mechanics, which hate 
begun to spring up rather rapidl> , is made possible only by the semantic back- 
ground imparted uiicoinciouily (as jet) to younger phjsicists by the Einstein 
theorj It is my hope that the present work may make the abote issues con- 
scious, and so enable us not only to impart this semantic attitude more easily 
and with less labour but also to benefit by them more universally in our daily 
life The problems of science and life do not differ in this respect. In both we 
are equally hampered by semantic disturbances, 'emotional stupors’, identifi- 
cation, and similar difficulties, the elimination of which means better adjust- 
ment for all of us, as well as swifter progress in science 

A study of the history of science shows how slow and painful scientific 
progress has been Now w e begin to see why ‘Geniuses’, as history shows, are 
men w'ho at least in some fields are freer from identification and false evaluation 
than others They are not hampered to a similar extent by ‘emotional stupor’; 
hence they can eialuate the old anew Lorentz, for instance, produced the 
formulae, but his objectifications prevented him from evaluating properly the 
new formulae. As a fact of history the formulae of Lorentz were disco\ered by 
Voigt a number of years before, but identification made impossible the evalu- 
ation of these formulae, and so delayed the discovery of the Einstein theory. 
This factor of identification can be found all through recorded history as a 
retarding semantic blockage 

If we could find methods of eliminating these semantic disturbances, an 
extremely hampering, paralysing psycho-logical factor would be eliminated, 
and ‘geniuses’ could be made the rule rather than the exception Let me say 
again in the old dajs morons were made and geniuses were born, in the new' 
days, perhaps, this can be ret ersed, and morons will be born but geniuses made. 
We W'ltness something of this kind among the younger post-einsteiman physicists, 
where the number of ‘geniuses' is growing rapidly, in spite ot the fact that the 
above structural issues are not as yet consciously applied in general education 
The secret of creative work is freedom from structural bondage, and particu- 
larly the structural semantic bondage of words. 

The reader should not assume that the few simple structural explanations 
given in this book exhaust the Einstein theory I have not even attempted to 
summarize the theory, I have only given a few semantic facts, which belong to 
general semantics and to the theory of knowledge The Einstein theory is 



REFLECTIONS ON THE EINSTEIN THEORY 677 


indeed such a tremendous structural linguistic achievement that quite probably 
Its full semantic signiScance and meanings will not be worked out for many 
years to come We have given here only the minimum of explanation necessary 
for our special purpose 

The historical development of a theory has usually little to do with the 
semantic importance of the theory or its deeper meanings The constancy of 
the velocity of light for all observers, which started the ball rolling, was an his- 
torical beginning and it served its purpose well, though the objectified ‘contrac- 
tions' and formulae of FitzGerald and Lorentz also did their share, as they 
helped Einstein and Minkowski to produce their epoch-making structural 
challenge to old prejudices such as ‘absolute space' and ‘absolute time', which 
were semantic remains of a primitive, perhaps pre-human, remote past Once 
this is accomplished, no matter how, there is no return possible Of phj sical 
structural facts, all that we need is the fimte velocity of the propagation of 
events,’" which as we already know involves far-reaching structural and semantic 
issues. Of the psycho-logical issues involved, we need only to eliminate semantic 
disturbances which still occur when we copy animals in our nervous processes 
and do not discriminate between different orders of abstractions — which animals 
do not recognize This elimination can be done by training m the A methods 
explained before, with the net result that we become ‘conscious of abstracting’ 
on different levels and so can instinctively and by feeling discriminate habitually 
between orders of abstractions, which structurally and semantically could not 
be done by the old disciplines. 

The theory of Einstein has manifold applications but we need only mention 
a few, which we shall utilize later on 

First, and above all, there are no possible ‘absolute’ meanings to 'space' 
and 'time', beyond the relations established by measurements The structure 
of our language involving ‘sfiace’ and ‘time' should be similar to the structure 
of experimental facts, which ultimately show the impossibility of sharply 
dividing them 

If any one challenges this statement, he could not a pnon be criticized 
Such criticism would be entirely against the w'hole tendency of the present 
work. But such a person might be approached with no little curiosity and 
expectation. He could be asked ‘You claim that you can absolutely diMde 

*‘But,’ some reader may ask, 'though you assume a fimte velocity of propaga- 
tion, may it not happen that some day an “infinite” velocity will be disco\ered’’ 

Such a question would show that the reader has missed the point in the pres- 
ent work We are confident in saying that an ‘infinite’ velocity has no meaning, and 
that no matter what we discover, this will never be discovered This becomes still 
clearer if we use the differential definition of 'velocity' Velocity is defined as the 
‘time’ derivative of ‘space’ travelled If 'time' is taken as zero, or if we have ‘no 
time', there can be no ‘time derivative' by our very assumption, and, therefore, no 
‘velocity’ There is, therefore, no danger that we shall ever discover in the actual 
world an ‘infinite’ velocity.

The fact is, of course, that he cannot demonstrate the process, because he 
refers to identifications inside his skin, yet he is claiming to be able to show it 
objectively outside his skin That ends this problem. 

While speaking of Einstein’s Theory, it will be well to mention a few of the 
many structural differences between the older new toman and the new einsteinian 
mechanics 

In the ^V-system, relative veloaties were simply added lEv =11-1-1'' In the 
einsteinian system which we will denote by it is not so atructurally simple. 
We must introduce the finite velocity of propagation of our signals, which alone 
give us the data, and so 

if — - 


the velocity of 
is equal to the 


H-tic/c* 


1 

The above formula involves the remarkable constant, c, 
light If we assume in the above formula that our velocitj v' 
celocity of light, c, vve would have 

v+c _ v+c _ 
t+v/c 

This means that the addition of some velocity to the velocity of light does not 
alter the velocity of light, which thus appears as a limiting velocity 
This applies to the difference of velocities where 

V —i/ 

Let us here give an example of Eddington’s Let us assume two relativ e veloci- 
ties each differing b> only 1 km /sec from the velocity of light Let us say that 
one IS 299,999 km /sec and the other 300,001 km /sec Now let us calculate the 
relative velocity This relative velocity will be found to be 180,000 000,000 
km /sec For in our formula v— u' =(c-l-l) — (c — 1) =2, and 

(1 -w'/c-) = 1 - = 1 = 1 - 1 +l/c2 = l/c=, 


whence Wy -p, = 2c2 =2 X 300,000 x300,000 = 180,000,000,000 

1/c" 

We see that a particle which might try to overtake light by having a velocity 
of one km / sec greater than the velocity of light could never succeed When the 
velocity 299,000, for example, was reached, the particle would find itself further 
away from its goal than when it started ‘ 

Similar general considerations apply to mass If we designate the mass of 
a particle at rest by nio its mass in motion

As the denominator is smaller than unity the mass in motion, is larger 
than jMoi the mass at rest In the limiting case, when the velocity would become 
equal to c the denominator would become zero and our mass wiy would tend

toward infinite values, ivhich is another way of saying that it is physically 
impossible 

In the iV^-system ive had two kinds of energy, one was called vis viva, or 
kinetic energy, and was represented by T = mti-/2 . the other w as called potential 
energy, or capacity for work, and was denoted by U The law of conservation 
of energy in the iV-sjstem was expressed by the statement that the sum, 
T+U=E, or the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant (zero 
variation) during the motion of the body. 

We see that as the above formula involves the terms ni and v, the older 
formulae for energy must be altered, especially since they do not sun'ive a 
Lorentz-Einstein transformation It is found that 

(w— Wo), or m=ma + Tfj/c^, 

which formula appears rigorous as a definition of kinetic energy e\ en if members 
of order higher than the second are taken into account In words, the mass in 
motion differs from mass at rest by the kinetic energy divided by the square 
of the velocity of light. 

This expression suggests immediately that the static mass, m, is similarly 
related to the energy content in the body at rest Generalizing our results we 
would have w=£/c®, an equation which holds generally between mass and 
energy This fact has been called by Einstein the law of the inertia of energy 
It has been verified repeatedly by experiments, and is one of the most striking 
structural results of Einstein's theorj' The above statement means that the 
tw'o fundamental notions of ‘mass' and ‘energy’ are equivalent and thus we 
hav e a clearer vision of the structure of ‘matter’ The two older structural laws 
of ‘conservation of matter' and of ‘conservation of energy’ become fused into 
one Mass becomes structurally and verbally nothing else than energy con- 
centrated at a point, and it appears as a form of energy manifestation ^ 

The above considerations have also led to a revision of our structural 
notions about ‘energy' which we do not need to explain here Suffice it to say 
that the old ‘potential’ energy is not associated structurally any longer with 
any features of this world. It can be made to vanish by a proper selection of 
co-ordinates, hence it is no longer considered as energy of any kind ® 

With the Minkow'ski world we became acquainted with a new language 
wdiich represents structurally more nearly the facts of experience (lower order 
abstractions) and shares the structure of our higher order of abstractions So 
we have the language of ‘space-time’ How about ‘matter''’ The bumping 
against something hard is not to be disregarded True, we need a language of 
new structure, but that is all In the Einstein thcorj, ‘matter’ of course is not 
treated separately as such It is an offspring of the field, and is connected with 
the curvature of the world The reader should not be surprised to find that the 
Minkowski world, which has accelerations, must be curv'ed in this structurally 
new form of representation . 

We have already defined a most fundamental entity called ‘action’ Natur- 
ally in a space-time manifold, energy multiplied by ‘time’ should be a more 
fundamental entity than energy, and we call it ‘action’ When we speak about 



680 IX. ON EMPIRICAL AND VERBAL STRUCTURES 


some continuous material present in ‘space’ and ‘time’ we speak in terms of 
density Density multiplied by a three-dimensional volume of ‘space’ gives us 
mass, or what appears as its equivalent — energy From a four-dimensional, or 
space-time point of view, density multiplied by a four-dimensional t olume of 
space-time gives us action V\'e see that the multiplication of density by the 
three dimensions of ‘space’ gives us mass or energy A fourth multiplication by 
the dimension of ‘time’ gives us mass or energy multiplied by ‘time' nhich 
becomes action by definition It is obvious that, structurally, action must be 
more fundamental than the older quantities 

In terms of curvature, action represents the curvature of the world, because 
where we find ‘action’, we also find ‘matter’, acceleration, gravitation , ^ 

‘Action’ Is fundamental, because structurally in a four-dimensional metrical 
manifold it takes the form of the simplest integral invariant that can exist at 
all On this form of action Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory is built The 
quantity action appears as a pure number,® a unique, specific relation which 
conditions structure 

We should expect that the action represented by the number 1 would be 
most interesting and would eventually represent the indivisible atom of action 
The modern quantum theory seems to favour such a point of view. 

When we encounter a pure number having such crucial significance in this 
world we should not wonder that such a number intrigues us As yet it is im- 
possible to state that action cannot have fractional numbers What, then, 
would the action represent'* 

Eddington suggests that the number may represent a probahhly or some 
function of a probability 

We combine probabilities by multiplication, but we combine actions m 
two regions by addition V e see, therefore, that the logarithm of a probability 
gives the function indicated and Eddington suggests the provisional equivalence 
of action with the negative of the logarithm of tlie statistical probability of the 
slate of the world around us Such a suggestion is extremely appealing and 
important because the principle of Least Action can be stated as the principle 
of greatest probability The laws of nature appear to be such that the actual 
state of the world is represented by that which is statistically the most probable 
That such structural conclusion can be drawn at all is of tremendous 
semantic importance for us because, as we are abstracting in different orders all 
through, the only appropriate language in which we can eventually hope to 
speak correctly, is the language of probabilities, statistical averages , 

Action IS one of the terms of pre-einsteinian physics which has survived 
unmodified, the only other one being entropy The law of gravitation, the laws 
of mechanics, and the laws of electromagnetism, can all be, not only summed 
up, but also deduced, from a single pnnciple of least action This important 
structural unification was accomplished even before the advent of the einstemian 
theory, and only the addition of gravitation to this list is new ’’ 



REFLECTIONS ON THE EINSTEIN THEORY 681 


In this brief structural and semantic survey we ha\e had neither the op- 
portunity nor the necessity of analysing the general theory of Einstein, which 
embodies and unifies most of the laws of mechanics, that of gra\ itation included * 
In this unification lies the unri\ ailed grandeur of the theory As we shall see 
later, the newer quantum theories ha\e been already very much influenced bj' 
the Einstein theory As all possible theories are dependent on human ingenuity 
and never can be the events themselves, we can rest assured that once freed 
from ‘emotional stupors’ and semantic disturbances, the world w ill not be long 
m producing a whole structurally unified system of science 

In our discussions we deal with ‘apparent’, ‘real’, ‘actual’, and similar m o 
terms. We should recall that mathematics is exclusive in one respect, namely, 
that It has no content. It is entirely a product of higher abstractions created 
by definition from undefined terms We have seen that mathematics must be 
considered as a language of special structure which is, however, similar to the 
structure of the world around us 

Our daily A language, among others, being based on the ‘is’ of ‘identity’, 
can never give a structurally satisfactory picture of this world or ourselves, but 
actually prevents such an achie\ ement Having abandoned a language which 
leads to identification, we shall be able to apply a new language, with new 
structure, by which we achieve better means for representing the events around 
us. From this point of view, mathematics and our daily language do not differ 
Terms, being not the things they represent, must by necessity be creatures of 
definitions and undefined terms The solution of many baffling semantic prob- 
lems is found in the structure of a language which intolves different semantic 
and unconscious attitudes. 

*In fact, a few months ago, Einstein and Mayer succeeded m reducing the 
laws of gravitational and electromagnetic fields to a single basis This was 
accomplished by the aid of a very revolutionary mathematical discovery that it is 
possible to introduce into a ‘space’ of n dimensions, vectors with m components 
Although at present the results of the quantum theory are not included in this 
theory, there is no doubt that shortly, because of this mathematical discovery, 
these will be included in a generalised theory of lelativity.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


Rather against my better judgment I will try to give a rough impression 
of the theory. It would probably be wiser to nail up over the door of the 
new quantum theory a notice, “Structural alterations m progress — No 
admittance except on business", and particularly to warn the doorkeeper 
to keep out prying philosophers. (149) A s eddincton

CHAPTER XL 

THE OLDER ‘MATTER’ 


And yet when I hear to-day protests against the Bolshevism of modern 
science and regrets for the old-established order, I am inclined to think 
that Rutherford not Einstein, is the real villain of the piece ( 149 ) 

A S EDDINGTON' 

Micro-mechanics appears as a refinement of macro-mechanics, which is 
necessitated by the geometrical and mechanical smallness of the objects, 
and the transition is of the same nature as that from geometrical to physi- 
cal optics. (46(>) E. SCHRODINGER 

From the dawn of history, man has had to deal with different bits of 
materials, some hard and solid like stones, some soft like fruit or flesh, some 
liquid In remote antiquity air and gases were not considered as ‘matter’. 

In those days ‘matter’ was structurally only what could be seen, or felt, 
or touched : anything else was some kind of ‘spirit’, and eterything ‘existed' 
in an ‘absolute void’ But even m remote antiquity our primitive ancestry 
could not miss the fact that the bits of materials they dealt with could be 
divided into smaller bits Naturally, if we can subdi\ide bits into smaller 
bits, an interesting question arises How far can this di\ ision be carried on^ 
It seems that Democritus (about 460-360 b c ) was the first man on record to 
formulate an atomistic theory He already postulated structurally a subjective 
world picture, to be contrasted with an ‘absolute’ or objective world in which 
‘motion’ was all important This theory started us on the mechanistic road 
formulated for macroscopic events, and also on the road of individualization, 
the study of smaller and smaller bits of materials and the search for some unit 
bricks out of which this world appeared to be built, all of which was already a 
search for m 0 structure. 

With the advent of chemistry some further fundamental structural light 
was thrown on the problem of indixidualization It was found that certain 
materials, as, for instance, iron, copper , remain one material, no matter 
how far we carry our subdivision These were called ‘elements’ At present 
we recognize 92 elements, a number which is supposed to represent all possible 
elements Out of these a remaining few were at first predicted theoretically, 
and just the other day discoxered experimentally All other materials do not 
stand division so well At some stage they decompose into their elements 
The smallest bit of one of these last materials which still has the characteristics 
as the bulk, is called a molecule. The molecule is found to be built up from 
atoms of the elements For instance, the molecule of water still has the charac- 
teristics of water, and consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxj gen, 
which are no longer water but elements of entirely different characteristics * 
Electrochemistry taught us m the meanwhile an important structural 
lesson; namely, that definite electrical charges are combined with the atoms 
Such electrified atoms are called ‘ions' (Greek for trax eller) For instance, a 


‘•‘The above statements are over-simplified, but satisfactory for my purpose

X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


molecule of water is broken up into a positi\ely charged hydrogen ion con- 
sisting of two hydrogen atoms, and a negatively charged ovygen ion consisting 
of one oxygen atom 

But electricity had more structural surprises in store for us About 1880 
new facts were discovered One of them was that a mo\ mg electrical charge 
has the effect of an electrical current, namely, it can deflect a magnet just as 
a current docs Such moving electrical charges were called com ection currents, 
and the fact that they produce effects similar to an electnc current led J J 
Thomson to a surprising conclusion According to the Maxwell theory of 
electromagnetism a certain amount of energy must be associated with every 
electric or magnetic field If an electrical charge in motion can produce mag- 
netic effects, hence energj , it was concluded, and verified by experiment, that 
energy was required to set an electrical charge in motion From which it 
follows structurally that an electrical charge possesses a characteristic in common 
with other materials, namely, inertia, which can be o\ercome only by the 
application of energy This inertial mass of the electric charge was called 
electromagnetic mass 

Here we see two fundamental structural issues involved One is that 
electricity seemingly has an inertial mass similar to that of ‘matter’ The 
other IS, that in con^ ection currents, we find means to study electromechanical 
parallelism, and so discover the relationship between electrical and mechanical 
theories 

In the year 1895 Lorentz proposed the electron theory He assumed 
structurally that moving molecules contain electrical charges and so produce 
con% ection currents These charges are further assumed to be one electrical 
quantum and were called electrons The electron theory proxed to be enor- 
mously fruitful and all further advance in our structural knowledge is inti- 
mately connected with it 

As knowledge advanced, the more convincing became the structural 
evidence for some electronic theory As already noted, a moving electrical 
charge produces magnetic effects So also should a moving electron, whence 
we succeeded in accounting for magnetic effects m terms of moving electrons 
which in this case represent molecular convection currents 

Granting this, a revolving electron should represent also a small magnet 
and a mechanical gyroscope as well Einstein in 1915 venfied this assumption 
by an experiment If these structural assumptions were true, then, by a quick 
reversal of magnetism, a soft iron rod should turn by a slight but definite 
amount The rev'erse effect has also been v erified , namely, a soft iron rod when 
rotated rapidly around its axis becomes magnetized 

The discovery of radioactive materials was also of enormous structural 
importance, as it gave us a means of studjing directly the rays emitted from 
these materials The rays were found to be of three kinds and were called 
by the first letters of the Greek alphabet The a-rays have been found to be 
similar to posihv e rays, the |3-rays similar to cathode ray s, and finally the 7 -ray's 
to Rontgen-rays Further investigation revealed that the a-rays were atoms 



THE OLDER ‘ilATTER’ 


687 


of helium charged with a double positive charge of electricity, and that the 
|3-rays were negatively charged particles with the charge of an electron 

These few remarks already make apparent the structural fact that electro- 
magnetic phenomena exhibit characteristics quite similar to those of 'matter', 
some of their processes arc atomic, they have inertia , 

In the older days we tried to apply macroscopic mechanical structural 
laws to electromagnetic phenomena, but were not very successful The laws 
which applied to those sub-microscopic levels were seemingly different from 
those which applied to gross macroscopic levels, just as the psycho-logics of 
the individual differ from the psj cho-logics of the mob 

An epoch-making semantic step was taken by Rutherford when he formu- 
lated the electromagnetic theory of the structure of ‘matter’ In this theory 
the atoms represent complex structures built up of positive and negative 
electrons, and their number and arrangements (structure) determine the 
chemical and physical characteristics of the atom m question The old struc- 
tural dogma of the immutability of the elements became untenable, and today, 
theoretically, and in a few instances experimentally, it has been established 
that a transmutation of elements is not only a possibility but a rather well- 
established structural fact of 1933 

It should be noticed that once more one of the fanciful linguistic, structural, 
‘infinities’ has been abolished The elements appear as transitory processes 
with a ‘life’ of a limited span of years The experimental structural evidence 
which physicists and chemists have gathered is overwhelming and, though the 
positive theories (verbal structures) may not alwa> s be satisfactorj , the negative 
results leading to the rejection of the older theories are conclusive This point 
IS of supreme structural importance to us 

A short description of the different atomic models comes later in this 
chapter, but first something must be said about the old quantum theory, which 
represents at present the central problem in science and out of the solution 
of which the most revolutionary consequences are bound to follow 

The main problems of the quantum theory may be described and con- 
trasted somehow as follows If vve take a line X'X and select a point 0 as the 
origin, we may fix the position of a point P on this line by the co-ordinate x 
In practice we find the values of v by 

measurement If we assume that x x ^ 

varies continuously we can expect that 0 p ^ 

by refined measurements we can find Fig 1 

V aluesof x as close together as vve please 

Experiments show that for the processes going on ‘inside of the atom’ the 
structural conditions arc somehow radically different In comparing them with 
the above example, we should hav^e to give our point only the freedom of occu- 
pying certain discrete points, let us say 1, 2, 3 , but all fractional values, such 
as 1/2 or 2/3, would be impossible If the only possible values of * are whole 
numbers, then the possibility of finding values of x as close together as we 
choose in order to make more precise measurements is excluded. If we find. 



688 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


for instanrp, that our x is neither 1 nor 2 nor 4, and cannot be larger than 4, 
the only solution is that our x must be 3 

These conditions, which are actually found in the atomic mechanics, rep- 
resent an entirely new and unexpected structural state of affairs The whole of 
the older quantum mechanics can be summarized in the statement, that its 
peculiarity consists in the fact that structurally characteristic discrete numbers 
make their appearance, and that the processes ‘inside the atom’ are to be 
described by discrete numbers 

The usual classical quantum mechanics demands that x be allowed to take 
all possible continuous values, but that the integral values of x represent the 
so-called stationary states through the quantum conditions Under such con- 
ditions the intermediate fractional values had no meanings 

It IS safe to say that, when in 1900 Planck formulated his quantum theory 
along the structural lines sketched here, it meant a complete and revolutionary 
structural and semantic departure from all accepted standards in life and 
science, for studying this world 

Planck has show n that it is impossible to explain the spectral distnbution 
of the energy radiated by a black body under the older assumptions that energy 
can be divided indefinitely into smaller and smaller parts, but that it may be 
explained on the structural assumption that the energy exists in quanta of 
finite size liv, where v is the frequency of the radiation and h is a constant 
(It = 6 54 X 10“^^ erg sec ) 

These observations lead to the revolutionary structural conclusion that 
the emission of radiation occurs discontmuously, and so the characteristic dis- 
crete numbers make their appearance 

It seems natural that because of this peculiar appearance of whole numbers, 
periodic processes such as rotations or oscillations should be closely related 
structurally with the quantum theory As a matter of fact the most important 
structural and semantic reconciliation of continuous differential equations of 
the older mechanics with the appearance of discontinuous whole numbers has 
been solved by the newer quantum mechanics on this basis as explained in 
the following chapter 

The kinetic theory of heat and the atomistic theory of electricity have 
shown an enormous productivitj' It is quite natural that these theories (verbal 
structures) should be highly workable, considering the structure of our nerx ous 
systems, as explained in the foregoing chapters It was this principle of indi- 
vidualization which helped so greatly The quantum theory is a structural 
attempt to extend this method of individualization, or the atomistic principle, 
to processes themselves 

As in the older days we introduced units or elementary quanta of mass, 
and later, an elementary quantum of electric charge, so in our newer knowledge 
we have need for an elementary quantum of action Action is defined as energy 
multiplied by ‘time', or A =Et 

Naturally such a product as energy multiplied by ‘time’ must play an 
extremely important structural and semantic role in this world of space-time. 



THE OLDER ‘MATTER’ 


689 


where nothing happens ‘instantaneously’, but all action requires ‘time’. If we 
could discover some unit ol action, we could change from the language of 
‘energy’ and ‘time’ to the language of ‘action’ and ‘time^’. This language, b> 
the way, is much more satisfactory and structurally closer to experience than 
the old languages. ‘Action’ as structurally defined (product of ‘energy’ by 
‘time’) is one of the two fundamental entities of pre-relatiMty physics iihich 
have survived the Einstein revolution It is really a universal term which we 
can apply without danger of degrading science into priv-ate gossip From the 
neurological standpoint, as it deals with definite units and timei, such a term 
has all the structural earmarks of an abstraction of highest order and of being 
really semantically important. Energy in space-time must by necessity be 
reformulated as ‘action’. The quantum theory posits structurally that the 
action of physical processes is built up of a number of elementary quanta of 
action 

From the fact that electromagnetic waves and lightwaves have one ve- 
locity, Maxwell concluded that lightwaves are of an electromagnetic character, 
a conclusion which further experiments have fully justified Einstein, in 1905, 
successfully applied the quantum structural principle to the theory of light, 
and in 1907 to the theory of heat of solid bodies 

The evolution of our theories concerning the internal structure of atoms 
has, until lately, closely followed our astronomical theories, but with the newest 
quantum mechanics this structural analogy seems less useful The first atomic 
model on an electrical basis was proposed by J J Thomson He assumed the 
atom to consist of a uniformly dense spherical volume 
charge of positive electricity, within which electrons 
described circular orbits. But the discovery of radio- 
activity and the fact that the alpha-rays could pass 
through sev'eral centimetres of atoms (which means pene- 
trating through many thousands of atoms), without their 
direction being altered made these assumptions struc- 
turally untenable 

The Wilson photographs (Fig 2) show clearly that a 
single atom can deflect the alpha-particle by a large angle 
which makes it clear that the nucleus of an atom must be 
considered as a very small part of the volume of the atom 
The large deflections of the alpha-particles show also that 
the mass of the nucleus must be much larger than the 
mass of the deflected particles Observ ations show also 
that the deflections increase with the atomic weight of the 
deflecting materials These and similar facts led to the 
structural assumption that the mass of the atom is prin- 
cipally concentrated in the nucleus and that the mass of 
the electrons must be very small in comparison with that of the nucleus 

As the atoms are in general electrically neutral, we had to assume that the 
positive charges of the nucleus are compensated by the negative charges of the

electrons These and other structural considerations led Rutherford to propose 
a different atomic model, which was much more successful for a while 

The Rutherford atom is supposed to be composed of a nucleus of positiie 
electricity surrounded by negative electrons The simplest atom is that of 
hydrogen, and was assumed to consist of one electron revolving around the 
simplest positive nucleus or proton, each having a charge, e =4 77 X 10“^° e s u , 
and different masses, the mass of the nucleus or proton being 1845 times the 
mass of the electron The other atoms represent more complex structures built 
up of protons and electrons, into the details of which we need not enter here. 
But this theory encourntered difficulties of theoretical as well as of experimental 
character. Niels Boh eliminated most of them by the application of the 
quantum theory to theatom , 

For simplicity of writing in that which follows, I will use a descriptive 
language omitting m each statement ‘we assume’ . , but the reader should be 
contnuously aware, that when we deal with the sub-microscopic levels we deal 
ony with inferential units the representation of which involves a great many 
assumptions For my purpose it is enough to stress (1) the negative fact, that 
the structure of materials is definitely different from that which was assumed 
before the ad^ ent of the quantum theories, (2) that m science, inferential units 
repiesent abstractions of higher order and are as reliable as the lower order 
abstractions which we gather on the macroscopic levels, if they are treated 
semantically as hypothetical units The layman should realize that his ‘world- 
outloolc’ appears as full of assumptions as any scientific one, except that his 
assumptions are not conscious and cannot be verified, whereas most of the 
scientific assumptions are conscious and are continually verified. 

In the older theory the orbits of the electrons were supposed to be arbi- 
trary, in the Bohr theory the orbits have precedence, for which a definite mag- 
nitude, a whole number multiple of the elementary quantum of action is specified 
We posit one-quantum orbits, two-quantum orbits , to which definite values 
of the orbits, the velocity, the number of revolutions, and the energy correspond. 
In a one-quantum orbit, for instance, the velocity is supposed to be equal to 

c/140, that IS one 140th of the velocity 
of light, and the number of revolutions 
equal to 6000 billions a second 

Bohr later modified his atomic 
model structurally by taking into ac- 
count the movement of the nucleus. The 
electron was not supposed to revolve any 
longer around the proton, but both pro- 
ton and electron were assumed to revolve 
around their common centre of gravity 
In the simplest form the Bohr atomie 
model IS shown in Fig 3, representing 
the atom of hydrogen, which we assume 
to consist of a nucleus with one positive

designated by a star, the three circles represent the possible orbits for the 
electron The orbit of radius a' is the most stable, and usually the hydrogen 
electron is supposed to be found there, but through the action of heat or electric 
fields or collisions . , the electron may be removed to one of the outer orbits 
a" or a'". Such a condition is not so stable, and sooner or later the electron is 
assumed to return to the orbit a' During these transitions of the electron, energy 
is radiated This structural model is similar to the copernican planetary system, 
the planet-electrons revolving around the sun-nucleus ^ 

The above diagrams show 
schematically the supposed 
structure of some of the simpler 
atoms Fig 4 represents the 
hydrogen atom, consisting of 
one proton and one electron 
revolving around the proton 
The mass of the proton is about 
1845 times the mass of the elec- 
tron, and we assume that the 
proton effectively gives us the 
mass of the atom 

Fig S represents the neu- 
tral atom of helium Its nucleus 
consists of four protons and two 
electrons, and it has two re- 
volving electrons, in all, four 
protons with four positive 
charges and four electrons with 
four negative charges, the eight 
charges just neutralizing each 
other 

Fig 6 represents a helium 
atom which has lost one elec- 
tron It has, therefore, four 
positive charges and only three 
negative charges Such an 
atom has a resultant positive 
charge, and is denoted by IIe+ 

If the helium atom loses tw'o 
electrons it is doubly charged 
with a positive charge (He++) 

The helium nucleus He++, as shown m Fig 7, represents the jiarticle emitted 
from radio-active materials

shown Iithiunie, with 6 proloiisi and 3 electrons m the nucleus, and 3 revoking

In general terms, Bohr tried to account for all other atoms on the base of 
the structure of the hydrogen atom The ne\t important generalization and 
extension of the Bohr theory was accomplished by Sommerfeld about 1915 
The achievement of Sommerfeld can be compared with the advance ivhich 
Kepler made over the copermcan theory of planetary motions Copernicus 
considered the planetary orbits as circular. Kepler* considered them as ellip- 
tical, and thus introduced a tremendous structural advance in astronomj 
Sommerfeld replaced the circular orbits of Bohr by elliptical ones The theor\ 
became much more complicated, because a circle is gi\en by one magnitude, 
namely, its radius, while an ellipse needs two data, its major and minor axes, 
and so two quantum numbers for the specification of an orbit. Sommerfeld also 
introduced some of the results of the Einstein theory, for example, that the 
mass of a body also depends on its velocity Since the velocity of the negatii e 
electrons in the atom is supposedly very large it was quite probable that the 
relativity considerations should be appreciable According to the Einstein 

theory, the faster a body is mo\ing 
the greater is its mass In an ellip- 
tical orbit the electron should ha\e 
a larger mass at the perihelion than 
at the aphelion, and so the orbit 
would not be exactly an ellipse but 
the perihelion would advance slightly 
at every revolution 

Fig 10 gives us the relativis- 
tic Kepler orbit as introduced b) 
Sommerfeld 0 is the fixed focus in 
which the nucleus is situated and 
P is the initial position of the peri- 
helion The motion of the perihelion 
occurs in one sense with that of the 
orbit ® 

The last analogy in the structure 
of the atom taken oxer from astron- 
omy was introduced in 1925, when Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck proposed their theorx 
of the spinning electron The electron xx'as supposed to be spinning about its 
axis like a planet or a top A similar notion was used by Compton in 1921, in 
connection with the magneton, but the notion of using the spinning electron for 

♦Kepler’s first law states ‘The planet moves in an ellipse, at one focus of 
which the sun is situated Perihelion is that point of a planet’s orbit at which it 
IS nearest the sun Aphelion is that point of a planet’s orbit at which it is farthest 
from the sun.’ 



THE OLDER ‘MATTER’

the solution of a structural difficulty in the quantum theory, and thus assigning 
a fourth degree of freedom to the electrons, originated with Goudsmit and 
Uhlenbeck independently of the work of Compton * It is not necessary for our 
purpose to follow all the further refinements of the classical theories Suffice it 
to say that scientists work under uniquely severe mutual supervision, and that 
any theories advanced in science are taken under consideration only when the 
new theories agree better with experiments, and when they also prove struc- 
turally fruitful in predicting new experimental facts, nhich again must stand 
fhe test of experiment 

The Sommerfeld orbits have proved to be an advance over the older Bohr 
orbits, but they had also to be refined to take into account that the electron 
does not seem to revolve around a simple nucleus but around a core consisting 
of the nucleus and one or more electrons, and so again we had more complex 
orbits 

For our semantic purpose it is enough to say that to the best of our knowl- 
edge (1933), this world appears entirely different from what our primitive an- 
cestors knew thousands of years ago, and perhaps from what the average layman 
knows today As the problems of ‘sanity’ represent problems of semantic 
adjustment, and adjustment means adjustment to something — in this case to 
the structures of the world around and in us — it appears imperative that we 
should take into account the best knowledge we have of these structures 

The few remarks given above about the structure of 'matter’ already show 
unmistakably that the old ‘matter’ is not so very ‘material’, so very ‘solid’, 
so very definite, as we once assumed it was, but it represents a process We see 
that our nervous system, because of its gradual growth and evolution, has 
developed different levels or strata, our ‘knowledge’ also has different levels or 
strata, operative as-a-whole, although different aspects of it can be analysed in 
terms of order The reader should retilize that because of the old j r we still 
‘need’ some ‘bits’ of something to speak about It is a hngtnstic semantic con- 
sequence of our pre-scientific, el language, which posits absolute ‘matter’, ‘space’, 
and ‘time’ Thus, through a process of identification, we ascribe to these terms 
objectiv'e existence In the old manner of speaking the term ‘is’ of identity 
played the mam semantic havoc 

In the older days electrons were often taken as ‘bits’ of something or other 
For the layman a ‘bit’ was identified with ‘matter’, and here a great deal of 
confusion comes to light Even a ‘bit’ of something is not necessarily material 
Materials, by definition, are supposed to exhibit colour, temperature, hardness , . 
A ‘bit’ which did not have these characteristics would not be material by 
definition 

Although the ‘electron’ is defined as an electrical charge, in the older days 
we had the habit of considering the electrons as some definite ‘bits' of something, 
some kind of ‘matter’ Through a process of objectification we made them 
revolve in definite ‘orbits’, with definite ‘velocities’ , which implies the definite 
application of terms such as ‘space’ and ‘time’, derived from macroscopic gross 
experience, but not necessarily applicable to the sub-atomic levels

X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘HATTER’ 


What has been said here about the structure of ‘matter’ is quite sutficieiu 
for our puipose lleie, as ah\a>s, the negative — the ‘is not’ — results count e 
are in a position to realize bi now that the overwhelming evidence which science 
gives and which would be impossible to repeat here, shows us a structural 
picture of the world of tremendous complexity, beaut> , and m>ster> of a struc- 
ture undreamed of by our primitive ancestors who formulated the current 
mythological structures which moulded our older s r and languages 

\\’e can sum up for our purpose, what we know about the structure of 
‘matter’ somewhat as lollows The bits of materials xisible and invisible to the 
unaided e\ e seem to be Icss simple than w'e assume them to be and to the best 
of our knowledge I represent extremely complex processes of a dynamic 

structure. It appears also that our usual forms of verbal representation w'hich 
were built b> our p-imitive ancestors are not similar in structure to the world 
and so are n.-c fit tT represent the happenings going on on the un-speakable 
levels. As all cur knowledge is due to the structure and function of our nervous 
sjstem, which ret-rcsents an abstracting mechanism, all our knowledge there- 
fore, appears as some kind of abstractions of different orders, on different lev els, 
of different character, and of varying precision and intensity, resulting in 
various definite general or indiv idual s r 

To bring w'hat is said here to the lower level of abstracting, namel> , to the 
level of structural visualization and feeling, we may use the rough analogue of 
an electric or mechanical fan When such a fan rotates we see a disk, simplj 
because our nervous system was evolved under natural conditions necessitating 
integration, and so docs not discriminate between the rotating blades The 
separate rotating blades are visually abstracted by us as a single solid disk, 
although there is no disk present 

To the best of our knowledge atoms represent very minute energetic con- 
figurations or d> namic structures where extremely rapid processes are going on, 
which our nervous system abstracts as ‘solid’ Judging by our present standards 
m science and the amount of knowledge we hav ewe may consider that science 
m the days of Newton (1643-1727) was in its infancy During that period 
we knew a little about the shining specks we see in the skies, and more about 
the rough macroscopic facts of our daily experience The genius of Newton not 
only advanced the detailed knowledge of his day in many branches of science, 
but also formulated two general theories One was the differential and integral 
calculus, which he discovered independently of his contemporary Leibnitz, the 
other was what we call mechanics 

In Newton's era the problems of macroscopic, microscopic, and sub- 
microscopic levels of investigation had not yet arisen in the modem sense, 
although in formulating the differential and integral calculus a theoretical 
structural step w'as taken toward the analysis of the processes on the subtler 
levels Quite naturally we applied the wisdom we derived from Newton to all 
phases of life and knowledge With the advent of more detailed structural 
knowledge of electromagnetic phenomena w'hich occur on sub-microscopic, as 
well as macroscopic levels, difficulties began to appear It seemed as if the

newtonian mechanics ^\ere not entirely applicable to these new and smaller 
scale phenomena Finally !Ma\^\ell (1831-1879) produced his famous theoiy 
of electromagnetism This theory appears structurally at tariance with the 
classical mechanics Attempts were made to reconcile both kinds of phenomena 
in one theory The problems of macroscopic, microscopic, and sub-microscopic 
structure and le\ els came to the foreground 

With the advent of the quantum theor>- further difficulties made their 
appearance. It became quite ob\ious that neither the classical ‘continuous’ 
mechanics, nor the classical electromagnetic theory could fully account for the 
‘discontinuous’ quantum facts The situation became acute and bewildering 
The Einstein theory w'lth its profound structural semantic and methodological 
revolution liberated us from our semantic delusions of the uniqueness, absolute- 
ness, and ‘objectivity’ of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ It built up a nciv semantic 
attitude m the younger generation of scientists already educated on this new 
structure, and therefore unhampered by the old prejudices New theories are 
now being formulated along increasingly more constructive and creative lines 
It is true that as jet neither ‘psj'chologists’ nor ‘philosophers’ have paid 
enough attention to the subjects discussed here, and so have not made us con- 
scious of the structural and semantic problems involved Howev er, the Emstcin 
theory has had a profound structural influence on the semantic attitudes of the 
younger scientists, though in the mam they are unconscious of this fact 

The mam issues at hand are twofold One is semantic, namely, to inculcate 
the permanent structural feeling that words are not the things they stand for 
If applied habituall)', this leads to the rejection of the term ‘is’ of identitj 
The other is to replace old languages and methods by structurally new languages 
and new methods, in vv^hich when we describe ordered happenings, we describe 
the functioning, the behaviour , by speaking more in a language of what 
something ‘does' than in the old language of what something ‘is’, which as we 
have seen mud be always structurally fallacious and semantically dangerous 
The reader should not take lightly these most general structural and 
semantic issues They are unusually important for sanity When they are 
formulated we can pass them on, and tram children in the new s r quite easilj' 
It IS much more difficult, after training a child thoroughly in the old vicious 
structural semantic habits of identification, eventually to have to appoint a 
guardian angel to watch him day and night to remind him that a word ii not 
an object , Such a procedure would lay a terrific strain on us and on the 
guardian angel It would probably be also v'cry expensive, judging bj our 
present earthly substitutes for the ‘heavenly powers’ 

Once this is realized and applied, the second issue becomes a purely struc- 
tural linguistic one There is no a priori reason why a language which applies 
to one level should apply to another 

With these two mam issues m view, it is readily understood why modern 
science tries so hard to develop functional languages and methods in order to 
be able to describe m terms of order happenings and processes which are ob- 



696 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


served Something similar could be said about all theories which postulate too 
much of a definite mechanism, usually involving some identification somewhere 

The slightest discrepancy between such a theory and obsen'ation elim- 
inates the theory as structurally unsatisfactory, while theories which succeed 
m not postulating mechanisms, and so are formulated in a functional language, 
last much better One of the enormous advantages of the Maxwell electro- 
magnetic theory is the fact that it describes the behaviour of electricity and 
magnetism while hardly positing any mechanism at all A similar statement 
applies also to the Einstein theory 

The above general remarks are extremely ivell illustrated by the newer 
quantum mechanics 

The classical theones, as usual with scientific theories, were very satis- 
factory in many respects, but not in all, which is an unattainable ideal always 
demanded from a good scientific theory. They also postulated too much of a 
definite mechanism, which was the result of, and led to, the semantic dis- 
turbance called identification Indeed, I have read an address by a prominent 
physicist m which he claims to have ‘seen’, and intites everybody else to ‘see’, 
an ‘electron’ He challenges his critics, and seems to feel like fighting — a quite 
usual result of identification Electrons represent inferential entities, and as 
such cannot be ‘seen’, but only inferred, which does not detract at all from the 
importance of the ‘electrons’. The ‘seeing’ business was good enough in the 
infancy of science, but not in 1933 We ‘see’ the stick broken in water, the 
camera records it as broken, and yet it is not broken We ‘see’ the fan as a disk, 
the camera records it so, but there is no disk We ‘see’ a ‘solid’ piece of wood or 
stone, which under the microscope proves to have a very different structure , 

In the older days the electrodynamics of moving bodies presented difficul- 
ties quite similar to the difficulties encountered in the quantum mechanics. 
Einstein by an epoch-making stroke of genius sol\ ed the problem by observing 
that, in the languages m question, we operated with a notion of ‘simultaneity’ 
which did not correspond to any obsertable structural phenomenon in the 
physical world He discovered that it is impossible to establish the simultaneity 
of two events occurring at different places, and that a thorough revision of our 
old theories is necessary in this connection. Einstein formulated a procedure, 
a method for measurements, taking into account the known laws of the propa- 
gation of light and electromagnetic phenomena He once more established the 
most important semantic thesis that the laws of nature are relations which are 
discovered between events which are actually observed, or which are funda- 
mentally observable. 

It appears that in the older quantum mechanics there were introduced 
some objectified entities which were never observed, as, for instance, the posi- 
tions, velocities, and periods of ‘electrons’ inside the atom. How indeed could 
w'e find lengths and ‘times' inside the atom^ Such a procedure requires the intro- 
duction of rods and clocks, which themselves consist of atoms, so that inside 
the atom such a procedure cannot be applied. We see clearly that all such 
conclusions are of an indirect character, but of course such conclusions should 



THE OLDER ‘MATTER’ 


697 


be based on some observable facts, and not only on our freedom to use words 
in any inannei whatsoevei It follows that we must gne up a language that 
speaks in terms of the 'position' of an electron at a gi\en ‘time’ , and use 
instead a language that describes observable characteristics, as, for instance, 
energy levels which are directly measurable by electron impacts and the fre- 
quencies which are derivable from them, the intensity and polarization of the 
emitted waves . , instead of electronic 'motions’ inside the atom, which nev er 
are and never can be actually obseived It is structurally indispensable to look 
for such data which are actual or at least can be observed 

As words are not the things we speak about, and structure is the only link 
between them, structure becomes the only content of knowledge If we gamble 
on verbal structures that have no observable empirical structures, such gam- 
bling can never give us any structural information about the world Therefore 
such verbal structures are structurally obsolete, and if we believe in them, 
they induce delusions or other semantic disturbances. 



CHAPTER XLI 


THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


The twofold nature of light as a light-wave and as a light-quantum is 
thus extended to electrons and, further, to atoms their wave-nature is 
asserting itself more and more, theoretically and experimentally, as con- 
current with their corpuscular nature (4BI) a. sommerfeld 

The concepts of wave amplitude, electric and magnetic field strengths, 
energy density, etc , were originally derived from primitive experiences 
of daily life, such as the observation of water waves or the vibrations of 
elastic bodies (2is) w Heisenberg 

The problem of quantum theory centers on the fact that the particle 
picture and the wave picture are merely two different aspects of one and 
the same physical reality (iisj w Heisenberg 

To me it seems extraordinarily difficult to tackle problems of the above 
kind, as long as we feel obliged on epistemological grounds to repress in- 
tuition in atomic dynamics, and to operate only with such abstract ideas 
as transition probabilities, energy levels, etc (466) e schrodinger 

. . for visualization, however, we must content ourselves with two in- 

complete analogies— the w'ave picture and the corpuscular picture C 2 is)

The following chapter w as wntten in 1928 and since then the newer quantum 
mechanics has been det eloped much further, proved enormously fruitful, and 
has been repeatedly supported by experiments The literature on this subject 
is steadily accumulating, the most important classical memoirs by the origina- 
tors of this new scientific trend have been collected into book form and are now 
easily accessible There is also a laige number of excellent technical, as well 
as non-tcchnical presentations On reading in December 1932 what I had 
written in 1928, I find that although from some aspects the presentation may 
be considered unsatisfactory and antiquated, jet the epistemological side of 
the older presentation remains valid. So it seems advisable to retain this chapter 
and add only a few further A suggestions 

It IS known that practically all creative and constructive physicists, who 
have produced rcxolutionary and lasting works, were interested in cpistemolog) 
There are many physicists who know as much physics as an Einstein, for in- 
stance, yet Einstein remains quite unique and his work is to a large extent 
responsible for the present revolutionary developments of physics The reason 
IS simple Einstein has corrected a long established epistemological fallacy, 
which can be expressed in my language as tire rejection of the structural fallacy 
of elementalism in a limited yet very important field of physics He also estab- 
lished and applied new fundamental epistemological principles, which is another 

698 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’

way of saying that he established new standards of evaluation in physics, as 
lor instance, that we should never postulate entities which cannot possibly be 
obserted, that the 'laws of nature’ should be formulated in terms of generally 
invariant relations expressed in tensor equations , . 

The weakness of the system of Einstein, resulting in many futile criticisms, 
lies in the fact that he eliminated elementalism in one vital region of ph> sics, 
but he did not formulate the general epistemological principle of non-elementalnm, 
■which should be applied everyw'here, daily life included This he could not 
have accomplished without a still deeper enquiry’ into the mechanism of timc- 
bmding, which produces all science, and which leads to the discoiery of the 
fundamental fallacy in the use of the ‘is’ of identity Only after the elimination 
of this remainder in us of the primiti\e man, docs structure become the only 
possible link between the objective and verbal worlds, and becomes also the 
only possible content of ‘knowledge’ ‘Similarity of structure’ then demands 
the complete and general elimination from science and life of any elementalism 

The strength of the new'er quantum mechanics lies in the fact that the 
younger phj sicists have accepted the new' ejiDch-making einsteiman standards 
of evaluation or epistemological principles, the weakness lies in the fact that 
the scientists do not realize that the fallacy of elementalism is entirely general 
and vitiates all scientific outlooks No one can produce satisfactory theories, 
nor evaluate, nor interpret them properly as long as he continues to use the 
few'-valued and elementalistic ‘logics' and ‘psjchologies’, ■which are at present 
always found at the bottom of any ‘e\aluation’ or ‘interpretation’ 

The latest work of Dirac goes xcry far in the direction of building ^ 
physics by establishing his language of transformations, states, observables , 
ascribing structure to protons, magnetic poles , but e\ en Dirac docs not seem 
to realize the general fundamental A issues inx olved Dirac saj s ‘The descrip- 
tion which quantum mechanics allows us to give is merely a manner of speaking 
which IS of value in helping us to deduce and to remember the results of ex- 
periments and which never leads to xvrong conclusions One should not try to 
give too much meaning to it' ^ (Italics are mine ) The italicized words show that 
oxen Dnac does not realize fully the mechanism of identification, as otherwise 
he w'ould not hax'e used these xvords in this form If we entirely abandon identi- 
fication, then a theory or a book, being verbal, represents nothing else but 
special language, there is no ‘mciely’ about that cither, structure being the only 
possible link betw'een the non-verbal and \crbal worlds Instead of warning 
the reader ‘that one should not try to gi\e too much meaning to it’, xve must 
simply insist that the only ‘meaning’ should be looked for in structure , the 
‘too much meaning’ alw’ays indicating inappropriate evaluation and ultimately 
semantic disturbances 

Current physical literature shows that the mam problems of ‘interpretation’ 
depend on the solution of the m o problems of ‘observation’, ‘reality’, ‘fact’ , 
and border on the scientific solution of the problems of pathological ‘delusions’, 
‘illusions’, and ‘hallucinations’, all of w'hich involve the fundamental issues of 
the elimination of identification But once the A issues are structurally formu-

!ated and applied in practice, they result in a Ai non-el, oe-talued onentation 
which involves the recognition of the muUiordtnahly of terms. , -which also 
solves the problems of quantum ‘interpretations', the details of which I cannot 
enter into here. 

Origmally the quantum writers had an inclination to ascnbe 'physical 
meaning' to waves The present tendencj- of specialists is to regard the waies 
as ‘purely simbohc", forgetting that experimentally something else besides the 
sjmbols ‘bends around the corners'. From a ^ point of \iew, -when the prob- 
lems of the multiordmaliti of such terms as ‘ob^en-ation', ‘fact', ‘realiti ' , 
are understood we will hate to ascnbe ‘phjsical realitj' to the waves, ascribe 
hnr-r structure to the 'electron'. We would also ha\e to abandon the A 
‘particle'-onentation and treat the ‘electron', ‘proton' , in a oc-talued 
wa\ as minute fields, which under the present experimental conditions behate 
as ‘particles’. This A field -onentation suggests a great manj possible inter- 
pretations impossible in the A ‘particle’-orientation 

MathematicalK , the geometry of ‘space filling’ curves would have to be 
elaborated further so that we would better understand the slrticUtre of plenums. 
and this knowledge should be applied to ph\siC3. 

We should also perform a direct senes of experiments with a more elaborate 
Faraday box A small wooden laboratorj should be isolated from the rest of 
the world bj e\ eiy a\ ailable energetic screen and ph> sical experiments repeated 
under such new d> namic conditions Technically the winding of, sa> . a foot 
thickness of insulated wires for different currents would not present an> dif- 
ficulties e.xcept for the door which should be also in the circuit The eventual 
probable results of experiments m such a laboratoiy' under different conditions 
could be calculated in ad\ance, and it maj be fairly well anticipated that at 
least significant discrepancies between the calculations and actual experiments 
would appear, throwing new light on the structure of the space-time plenum, 
the eientual connection between gra\itation and electromagnetism , Argu- 
ments alone will not help in this field and only experiments will point the 
pathw ay 

Because of the extcnsice literature dealing wnth the new quantum mech- 
anics It seems unnecessary to dw'ell upon it any further, except by expressing 
the hope that some mathematicians and phjsicists will master the A oo-valued 
orientation and w ill revise the theories now existing 

Section A Introductory 

The new researches in the structure of the materials of the universe pro- 
ceeded under unique conditions On the one hand, since Planck in 1900 origi- 
nated the quantum theory, which earlier elaboration we now call the classical 
quantum theory, the amount of experimental facts pointing in the direction of 
some quantum theory had become \ery convincing, yet, on the other hand, the 
lack of a structurally satisfactory theory to co-ordinate these new experimental 
facts was becoming distressing 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


701 


It appeared as though there were either a lack of ‘geniuses’ able to produce 
the required new theories, or the geniuses existed, but were unable to function 
properly They seemed to suffer from a semantic blockage due to some identi- 
fication which successfully prevented broader and unhampered \ision 

Presently the co-ordinating theories were produced In the production of 
the new quantum mechanics we see at work the unconscious semantic liberating 
influence of the E and JV systems which had been developed and which we 
have already analysed The classical theories had come to a structural impasse, 
but with the advent of younger scientists, who were educated in the theoretical 
semantic freedom of these new systems, the semantic blockage due to ascribing 
‘objectivity’ to ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ was removed, creative forces were 
released, and these young scientists proceeded to construct the structural for- 
mulations needed. They are now rightly hailed as geniuses 

It IS astonishing how these young post-einsteinian scientists of various 
lands and different inclinations produced, independently and practically simul- 
taneously, various new quantum theories, using different methods and different 
mathematical, as well as national, languages When these different theories 
were studied and compared they were found to amount practically to one theorj , 
but expressed by different mathematical languages Now the use of different 
mathematical languages to express one group of experimental facts brings an 
additional benefit m that it gives diversified verbal structural information about 
the problems at hand Since these developments are very recent and progress 
has been extremely rapid it is hard to keep track of the status of the problem. 
In this account of the newer quantum mechanics I will emphasize only the 
structural and semantic side, treating the different theories as behaviour of 
their respective authors, and as illustrating the issues above mentioned From 
this point of view, we are not interested in discussing to what extent the giv en 
theories are ‘true’ or ‘false', which means no more than similar or dissimilar to 
the world in structure We are interested directly in those semantic aspects of 
human behaviour which have been neglected W’hen ‘Smith’ puts a black mark 
on white paper, it is to be called human behaviour, and behaviour unique for 
man Our analysis does not involve the question of the validity of his doings 
But since he did it, let us analyse his doings 

In speaking about theories as complex and technical as the newer quantum 
mechanics, it is practically impossible to give a satisfactory account in a non- 
technical way Such theories have not yet been worked out thoroughly enough, 
many points are still not clear, and no proper ev alualion is possible at present 
These difficulties are really immaterial to our present purpose, because these 
theories are empirical facts on record, and they throw significant light on human 
behav'iour It is not here proposed to make reflections on the world around us, 
but to analyse a certain linguistic, structural form of human behaviour 

From the point of view of structure and s r, the classical quantum mechanics 
would be quite enough for sanity and adjustment, it is enough to realize that 
the still older theories of ‘matter’, ‘space’, and ‘time’ are el, structurally fallacious 
and represent only primitive identifications

X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER' 


The advent of such a crop of geniuses and of se\eral theories expressed 
quite difTeieiitly, yet nearly equivalent, is an eient of deep human semantic 
significance It helps to understand the working of the human nerious s\stem, 
and is in accord with the present general theorj- 

From the point of \ie\v of 
the physicist, these new theor- 
ies are a marked structural im- 
pro\ement o\er the classical 
theory, a fact which can best 
be illustrated by a diagram of 
a special case In Fig 1, the 
crosses indicate the experi- 
mental data, the cur\es indi- 
cate the results as predicted b\ 
the classical theory, b> the 
Compton theory , and by the 
new quantum mechanics It 
should be noticed that the neu 
quantum theory appears much 
more in accordance Mith the 
experimental data than the 
older theories This fact is of 
great structural and semantic 
importancelto us as well as to 
the ph> siciat 

At this point we may explain briefly the nature ol the problem that was 
demanding solution 

We have become familiar with the use of co-ordinates This procedure has 
been generalized and has gnen rise to ‘generalized co-ordinates' These arc 
defined as arbihary xariables which represent not merely lengths but ma^ also 
represent angles, surfaces, volumes , though they must be capable of repre- 
senting the 3)1 orthogonal co-ordinates If, in a special case, we make the 
number of generalized co-ordinates equal to the number of degrees of freedom 
which the s> stem has, these s generalized co-ordinates can be regarded as indc 
pendent of each other It w e denote b> 5, the generalized co-ordinate, g, (1 = 1 to s) 
then the orthogonal co-ordinates of any of the w particles can be represented as 
definite functions of the generalized co-ordinates, so that

We know that kinetic cnerg)’ is represented by viv"/! where vi represent- 
the mass and v the xelocity, or the ‘time' dcrndli\e of the ‘space’ traielled 

If w e w ant to find the t aluc for the cnerg> we must differentiate each of the 
3« equations (1) with res[)cct to ‘time’, which gives the components of the 
velocity, square them, multiply them by the corresponding masses and add 
them together to find the double xalue for the energy

It IS easy to see that if in (4) we put k-i we will have square members, 
.and when k, every term will occur twice and so the above abbreviation (4), 
covers the formula (3) 

If we write similar expressions for all of the 3» orthogonal co-ordinates, 
multiply by the corresponding masses and then add them together we obtain

The coefficients in the expansion of c,t. depend only on the values of the general-

The time-dcrivatives can be properly called generalised veloctltes, and we may 
denote them by q, ^ 

In establishing formulae for the quantum theory we want to be as general 
as possible and not restrict ourselves to vibrational energy only But we want 
to take into consideration any arbitrary point-mass, independently of whether 
we assume this point to be charged or not 

We define the momentum or impulse as the product of the mass and the 
velocity, or, p =mv If, instead of denoting our co-ordinates by y, y, and z, we 
use the generalized co-ordinates g„ we would have for the magnitude and 
direction of the v'elocities the time-denvativ'es of the co-ordinates, namely.

We should notice that the dynamical triplet of impulse co-ordinates occurs, 
conjointly with the geometrical triplet of the co-ordinates of position. The 
second law of motion tells us that ‘the change in momentum is proportional to 
the impressed force and takes place m the direction in which that force acts’. 
If we assume that the force K is derivable from the potential energy Ej,oi, (a 


function of g,) , then we have pt=K^ =

The abo\ e hamiltonian, or canonical, form of the equations is remarkable 
because it preserves its form if any arbitrary co-ordinates are introduced, it is 
invariant under the transformation of co-ordinates. The equations hold not 
only for an indiiidual point-mass but also for any arbitrary mechanical system. 
For arbitrary co-ordinates and systems the momentum or impulse p is defined by 

dE\in .^1 

p, = , so that the

kinetic energy is expressed as a function of the g,’j and their derivatives the g.'s 
To help visualization we can construct and consider the p and g as rect- 
angular co-ordinates in two dimensions in the phase plane of our system. In 
this plane the sequence of those graph-points that correspond to the successive 
states of motion of the system represent the phase paths or phase-orbits The 
characteristic structural feature of the quantum theory is that it selects a dis- 
crete family of phase-orbits from the infinity of possible orbits 

We next consider a point-mass m that is bound elastically to its position 
of rest, and which can move to either side of the central position only in the 
direction a; =g, or its reverse, when experiencing a restoring force We call such 
point-mass a linear oscillator If we wish to emphasize that our oscillator is 
capable only of definite vibrations, on account of its elastic attachment, we 
call It a ‘harmonic oscillator’. If the vibration number, or the frequency of the 
oscillator, which is represented by the number of its free vibrations per unit 
cf ‘time’, is denoted by v, then the vibration is represented by x =q =a sin 27ri'/

The impulse becomes p =mv =mq=2Trvma cos 2irvt. The phase-orbit is repre- 

qi *2 

seated by an ellipse in the ^-g-plane and is given by the equation — =1, 

a® 6“ 


where the minor axis 6 = 27ri'»ja 

In our family of orbits the phase area between two orbits is equal to the 
quantum of action h Sommerfeld regards h as an elementary region or element 
of the phase area, and considers it as the definition of the Planck quantum 
of action h If Wn represents the energy of the oscillator when it describes the 
B-th orbit, then Wn =nhv In these orbits the energy appears as a whole 
multiple of the elementary quantum of energy, e=hv, and Wn =«« 

We call stahonary states of the oscillator those states which the oscillator 
may pass through without cessation and without loss of energy, or, without 
radiation. 

When an oscillator retains its stationary state, its energy is constant and 
its graph appears as an ellipse of the family in the phase plane However, 
when the energy of the oscillator changes and jumps over to a smaller orbit, 
it emits energy When it passes to a latter orbit it absorbs energy. The emission 
and absorption of energy occurs in multiples of the energy quantum, e 

The graphs of the system in the phase plane are restricted to certain 
‘quantised’ orbits Between each orbit and its successor there is an elementary 
region, of area h. The w-th orbit, if closed, has as area nk Or, expressed sym- 
bolically, J'pdg=nh This integral is called the phase integral and is taken 
along the «-th orbit 

The quantum hypothesis can be structurally formulated so that the phase 
integral must be a whole multiple of the quantum of action h This form of 
the classical quantum postulate is more general than the original formulation 
of Planck, although it includes the latter as a particular case

In the classical theory, the quantised states were distinguished from all 
other possibilities by the characteristic whole numbers, and so we had a network 
In a quantum orbit the ‘electron’, if undisturbed, was supposed to move per- 
manently without resistance and not to emit radiation The phase-space, 
representing the manifold of the possible states, including non-stationary states, 
IS crossed, mesh-like, by the graph curxes of the stationary orbits The size 
of the meshes is determined by Planck's constant h ® 


Section C Matrices. 


The older quantum mechanics forms an elaborate system, and we have a 
large accumulation of numerical data on record Some of these data corroborated 
he older theories nicely, but some data were in contradiction to the classical 
45 



706 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


theory The problem was not to discard the numerical data, which, whatev er 
they mean structurally, represent quite solidly established data, but to find 
new equations which would be satisfied by these facts Now ‘new equations' 
really mean languages of new structure, and therefore new formulations had 


to be discovered 

Dealing with tables which give special theoretical data, it was natural to 
start with a calculus which deals with such numerical special tables Such a 
calculus had been de^ eloped long ago, and was called the matrix calculus 
Later on, when matrices themsehes were treated as complex quantities, and 
still later, as operators, we were enabled to pass to the more developed calculi 
which use ordinary differential equations The new quantum theories giv e us 
a unique case, in which several mathematical methods have been used at once 
and of which the results are fairly in accord 

At this point It IS advisable to give a few structural explanations of these 
mathematical notions, including the matrix calculus If we have two equations 
of the first degree with tw'o variables, namely, aiv+6iy=ri and =ci, 

the solution of these equations takes the form 

a\bz — 02^1 ni&2 — U2&1 

The common denominator of the two solutions can be written m a two- 
dimensional table

fli, 

02 , 62 1 

which is understood as the product of the upper left-hand number and the lower 
right-hand number, minus the product of the low'er left-hand and upper right- 
hand numbers 


Similarly, the numerators of these solutions can also be represented in 
the form of two-dimensional tables , nanieh ,

to which the above-mentioned rule applies Expressions like (1), (2), (3), are 
called determinants of the second order 


The numbers in the first, second , horizontal lines are called the first, 
second , rows, respectively , the vertical lines are called first, second , columns 
The above definitions and method can be applied to any number of 
equations with an equal number of variables, and in each case our determinant 
would have numbers, n rows and n columns. 

We may use another notation which employs one letter for the coefficients 
of our variables, wnth indexes or suffixes to indicate that their values are 
different Let us consider elements in the table

The expression (4) is called a determinant of the K-th order.

THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


707 


The notation by suffixes is very convenient and is very much used these 
days The first suffix denotes the row, the second the column in which the 
element is situated Usually the comma dividing the two numbers in the index 
is dropped and the coefficients are written simply an, instead of ai,i In general 
the element a,,i, or o,*., represents the element in row i and column k 

The elements lying in the diagonal joining the upper left-hand to the lower 
right-hand number are called the principal diagonal In our example we notice 
that the elements in the diagonal are such that ^=k 

We have definite rules by which we can arriv'e at the solution of oui 
equations, once the coefficients, which are the elements of the determinant, 
are given In general, the determinants are treated as a functional form 

If OT and « are positive integers, a manifold, or system of mn ordered 
quantities or elements arranged m m horizontal and n vertical rows, will be 
called a rectangular matrix and we may use the notation A ={a{mn)) 


( a(ll) o(12) a(13) 
0(21) a(22) a(23) 
a(31) a(32) a(33) 


^ , or (a(Hw)) 


The numbers m and « are called the orders of the matrix If ni =« the matrix 
is called a square matrix Without loss of generality we can treat any rectangular 
matrix in which m 9 ^ « as a square matrix by supplementing the missing rows 
and columns with zeros. 


A matrix of the type.

is called a diagonal matrix In the new quantum mechanics a diagonal matrix 
IS independent of t and represents a constant of the classical theory The 
reverse is not necessarily true. The operation of differentiation can be expressed 
m terms of multiplication of matrices with the aid of the unit matrix * 

Equations in which matrices are equated are called matrix equations If 
the equations involve only one unknown matrix, which does not occur more 
than once as a factor, such equations are called matrix equations of the first 
degree.

are together equivalent to one single matrix equation There are several ways 
in which the notation can be simplified 

The difference between a determinant and a matrix is subtle, but important. 
By a determinant we understand, by definition, a certain homogeneous poly- 
nomial of the «-th degree, in the elements o„ Accordmgly, a determinant 
gives a definite number when calculated 

But in many instances we are mterested in the table, or the n* elements 
arranged in a certain order but not combined into a polynomial Such an array, 
or table, is called a matrix Thus, from this point of view, a matrix does not 
represent a definite quantity, but a system of quantities, and so a matrix is 
not a determinant. 

We can illustrate this difference by an example If we take a determinant 
of the second order

and change the rows into columns, or vice versa, thus 

ttl, 02 

bi, hi 

the value of both determinants will be equal, namely, 

Ol&2 — £*2&lf 

by the definition rule already given , yet the matrices of the two determinants 
are different 

Although different, a determinant nevertheless defines a matrix, called the 
matrix of the determinant, conversely, a matrix defines a determinant, called 
the determinant of the matrix 

We have said that a matrix does not represent a quantity, while a deter- 
minant does At this stage, and from this point of view, we may say so legiti- 
mately However, we might eventually treat a matrix as a quantity also, but 
for this purpose we should have to enlarge the meaning of the term ‘quantity’ 

In our present use of the term 'quantity' we mean the real and complex 
quantities of ordinary algebra 

It may be said that mathematicians have had a peculiar tendency, which 
has proien of great value in the development of mathematics, gradually to 
extend the meaning of terms in order to embrace new notions as they arise 
For instance, xve have enlarged the primitixe meaning applied to positive in- 
tegers to embrace negative numbers, which formerly would not ha\ e been con- 
sidered as quantities Similarlj , if we here use the ordinary notion of algebraic 
quantity, then a matrix is not a quantity but a system of quantities The 
problem is, how shall we enlarge this meaning to include the matrices? 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


709 


Mathematics recognizes that this generalization of mathemattcal notions is 
extremely useful and kgitimale This structural issue appears to be of very 
general application, as all of us exhibit a tendency towards it It is a purely 
mathematical and useful tendency m mathematics, but it leads to disastrous 
results when applied to daily-life abstractions, as explained in Part VII In 
this connection we should recall the difference between the mathematical con- 
tentless abstractions and the abstractions with physical content, with which 
we are generally concerned in science and life. 

Let us now follow up the method by which a matrix can be considered as 
a quantity If we have objects of two or more kinds which can be counted or 
measured, and if we consider an aggregate of such objects, say 5 horses, 3 cows 
and 2 sheep, we could denote such a complex quantity by the symbol (5,3,2) 
In this case, the first place in our symbol would be reserved for horses, the 
second for cows, and the third for sheep 

In mathematics, we do not speafy horses, or cows, or sheep, but consider 
sets of quantities, and distinguish them by the position which they have in our 
symbolism We may denote such a complex quantity bv a single letter, 
A =(a,b,c,) (For instance, we denote a fraction by a single letter, although a 
fraction is specified by two numbers ) 

In such an instance, we should call a complex quantity equal to another 
when, and only when, the components are respectively equal And a complex 
quantity is said to vanish only in case all the components vanish 

Ordinary mathematical operations can be applied to such complex quan- 
tities For instance, we may define a sum or difference of two complex quantities 
A' = (ffli, bi. Cl) and A" = (02, 62, C2) as 
y4’±i4” = (<Ii±02, 6 i±& 2, Cl±C2) , 

a definition which is entirely satisfactory theoretically, and also practicall>, as 
can be verified from our example 

From this point of view W'e may consider a matrix as a complex quantity 
with pm or components A matrix ivould then represent a complex quantity, 
as a special case under the general method sketched above 

We could then define our further operations A matrix would be said to 
be zero when all elements are equal to zero Tw'o matrices would be said to be 
equal when they have equal numbers of rows and columns and every element 
of one IS equal to the corresponding element of the other 

By setting up some such rules we could develop a calculus of matrices, and 
matrices would be considered as complex numbers In general, the algebraic 
rules would be found to be applicable to matrices, which would further justify 
us in treating matrices as complex numbers 

One of the notable exceptions in our operations would be found in the 
application of the classical operation of multiplication and its dependencies 
In ordinary algebra and arithmetic, multiplication is what is called ‘commu- 
tative’ which means that 2 X3 = 3 X2 = 6, or a x6 =bXa. 

In defining the multiplication of matrices we have no a pnon grounds for 
determining why one definition or restriction should be preferable to another. 



710 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


Only practice can show which definition is more workable or more fruitful in 
results In the matrix calculus the definition of Cayley is generally accepted, 
as it has led to the most workable results It was based on considerations of 
the composition of linear tranformations 

The definition is approximately as follows The product ab of two square 
matrices of the H-th order gi^ es a square matrix of the w-th order in which the 
element which lies in the i-th roiv and j-th column is obtained by multiplying 
each element of the i-th row of a by the corresponding element of the j-th 
column of b and adding the results 

If we denote by a„ and the elements in the «-th row and j-th column of 
a and b respectively, then by definition the element (ij) of our product ab 
ivould gi% e, 

<Iilf>lj +012^21 + +flinin}i (5) 

and the (i,j) element in the matrix ba would be 

a]ib,i+ai,b,i-\- +anib,n ( 6 ) 

In general, the quantities (5) and (6) are not equal and therefore we see 
that the multiplication of matrices is, in general, 7iot comnnitotive The order in 
which we perform our multiplication is of importance and ab ts not generally 
equal to ba, (ab ^ ba) ® 

It should be noticed that the vector calculus has made us familiar w'lth 
new operations which differ from anthmetical operations For instance, the 
sum of two vectors differs in general from the arithmetical sum and is defined 
by the law of the parallelogram (see Chapter XXXIII) This definition is 
more general, and the arithmetical definition expresses only the particular case 
in w hich the vectors have one direction. Similarly, the non-commutative law 
of multiplication corresponds more closely to vector multiplication than to 
arithmetical multiplication 

We will not go further into the details of the matrix calculus, which is a 
well-developed mathematical discipline with a large literature, but will empha- 
size some methodological points of importance 

One of the mam applications of the theory of matrices is found in the 
subject of linear transformations 

In mathematics, instead of using the given variables, we very often intro- 
duce new variables which are functions of the old Such transformations, or 
change of variables, are particularly simple and important when the functions 
in question are homogeneous and hnear 

If Xi, Xi, , Xn represent the original variables, and xf, , .r„' the 
new variables, we have, by definition, the formulae of transformations 

*1^ =nilVl-|- • • -i-Ol7iXn 
Xn — flnlXl-f- ' “hOnn^n 

The square matrix made up of the coefficients is called the matrix of the trans- 
formation and the determinant is called the determinant of the transformation 
and IS completely determined by the matrix. We have already seen the import- 
ance of linear equations and linear transformations in physics and therefore in 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


711 


the investigation of the world around us The theory of matrices is connected 
with such transformations, hence the importance of the theory of matrices for 
physics 

For our purpose another charactcnstic of the matrix calculus is of interest 
and that is the fact that in phj sics we usually have a large number of empirical 
numerical data which enter as coefficients in equations and which can always 
be put in the form of a two-dimensional array of numbers, or a table, which 
we have ]ust called a matrix 

It appears that every physical quantity, however complicated, can be 
1 epresented by such a table giv mg the values of the parameters which determine 
Its character From the definition of the term 'variable' as any value out of 
a possible range of values, we might treat our variables in two distinct wajs, 
one from the point of view of funclton or operations, the other from the 
evtensioual point of view, when the function or operations are unknown, although 
the particular values of the variable are given The matrix calculus takes this 
last point of v lew 

In phj sical research vv ork we deal for the most part vv ith arraj s of numbers 
or unique and specific, mostly as> mmetrical, relations which the experiments 
give us Our usual problem is to find the structure, the function, and the 
operations which are satisfied by the given experimental relations 

We see that the dual approach to our solutions is due entircl> to the defini- 
tion which vve have accepted for the variable W e have two issues Either to 
find the values of the variable which satisfy the given function and operations 
or, hav mg particular values of the variable (experimental), to find the function 
and operations 

Obviously evciy physical quantity can be represented b> a matiix, which 
may be a sequence, and every mathematical theorem tan be reduced to a 
property of matrices Once the proper mathematical theories aie workedrOut 
it will be alw'av’s possible to pass from one form of representation to the other ® 

In the older mechanics the functions were rather obv ions and so the use 
of the matrix calculus w'as not so imperative In the newer mechanics, the 
opposite IS the case We have a large amount of numeiical experimental 
relations, but the functions and operations connecting these variables are 
unknown and the problem is to find them From this jioint of view the matiix 
calculus represents an extennonal calculus, a calculus of obicrvation In using 
the descriptive term ‘observation’ vve must add that some objections have 
been advanced to such a use of the term The answer is that the teim ‘observa- 
tion’, like most of our most important terms, must be considered a mnlltordinal 
term. Once this is understood the objections to the use of the term do not hold 

There is no limitation as to what the elements of a matrix may represent, 
they may be functions, functions of functions , 

Section D The operator calculus. 

The use of the operator calculus is interesting, structurally and psycho- 
logically, in that attention is concentrated, not on the numerical quantities, 



712 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘IklATTER’ 


but on the semantic operations of combining them The calculi used in the 
newer quantum mechanics are peculiar, because, while they retain the numerical 
data, and as far as possible, the classical equations, they alter the operations 
by which these quantities are combined, or the interpretation of the equations 
As an illustration of such a procedure we can take two different formulae 
for the addition of velocities, one from the classical mechanics, where 

Ei3 = r«+T23. fl) 

and the o±er, the formula for t elocity as given by the Einstein theory , nameh , 

_ Vii+Vzi 

ViiXVis ( 2 ) 

In these formulae V 12 represents the velocity of body 1 relative to body 2 , . 
In formula (1) the sign symbolizes the ordinary arithmetical operation of 
addition As we already know, this formula has proxen too simple to represent 
accurately the experimental data, and Einstein has replaced it by the more 
elaborate formula (2) 

The above statement is the usual way of speaking about the modification 
in formulation which has taken place in physics since Einstein But we could 
equally well say that the formula has not been altered except that the ‘ +' has 
no longer the old meaning and does not now represent the arithmetical operation 
of addition Both points of view lead ultimately to one value, E13, and the 
computations arc similar in both cases 

We should notice especially the great freedom vnth which we can treat 
mathematical entities Our voluntary selection of the point of view becomes 
important A similar freedom of selection of interpretation appears to a still 
larger extent in all verbal problems, a fact of considerable structural and semantic 
importance in any theory of sanity, as we have ali cady seen 

Further illustration of this freedom can be seen in the May in which the 
ordinary notion of multiplication is rc-interpreted in the operator calculus 
Let us denote by q and /, two numerical quantities, and qf as their product 
But we could \ lew this problem differently We could say that gf results from 
a semantic operation q performed on /, or a semantic operator (q X) acting 
upon / which transformed / into qf We could denote the operation of multi- 
plying by q or the operator {q X) by a single symbol Q Quite obviously the 
operator Q is not the number q, in other words, the semantic operation of 
multiplying, say by two, is not the number 2 

The operation of multiplying integer 1 by integer 2 gi\es the result 2 
Similarly, the operation of multiplying 1 by q, or, in our new language, the 
application of the operator Q to the integer 1, gi\es q In symbols, Ql=g 
If we take any arbitrary function /, the result of the operation of Q upon / is 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’ 


713 


written Qf=gf If we were to follow the operation Q by the differential operation 
d/dx the result would be* 


d\ dx dx Idx J dx 


d\ 

But as / IS arbitrary, it may be omitted from the equations and the result 
written m the operator form as 


dx dx Lif* J dX 


dQ 


The symbol — , defined by this equation, should be read as 'the operation of 
dX 

multiplying by dq/dx' Similarly, =^-P +0^ • 

dX dX dX 


In translating the ordinary equations into the language of operators nothing 
new IS introduced This translation involves only a change of 'mental' focus 
Instead of concentrating our attention on the numerical values we concentrate 
on the operations of combining them Since the great problems of the quantum 
mechanics consist in finding new methods of computation, or of combining 
numerical values, such a change of attitude may prove to be structurally useful 

It should be noticed here that once matrices are considered, and treated, 
as quantities, or unique and specific relations, by similar reasoning they can 
be treated as operators This problem is of fundamental structural and semantic 
importance because in the quantum theory we deal with matrices which ha\ e 
infinite numbers of terms and since this complexity presents great technical 
difficulties it IS of enormous advantage to be able to pass to some more 
de\ eloped methods of calculation 

At the preliminary stage in the operator calculus we ha\c assumed that 
multiplication was commutatne, that QP=PQ, but in the further and more 
general development of the theory, this does not hold 

In general we must assume in the operator calculus that multiplication is 
not commutative, that QPj^PQ For instance, if Q = {,qX) and P =d/dg, the 
two operations are certainly not commulatice Naturally, the validity of 
2 X2 =4 is not doubted, but generalized non-commutative multiplication has a 
definite asymmetrical and so structural geometrical interpretation, to be found 
in the vector calculus When we associate with each numerical quantity its 
own operation of multiplication we thus obtain a more general calculus. 
Operators may be regarded as compound, or built up from the elementary 
arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication They represent, so to 
say, functions of these operations ’’

X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


Section E The new quantum mechanics 

The main problem of the quantum theory is to determine these functions 
of the operations, so that the solution of certain equations (hamiltonian) may 
represent the experimental facts The original equations of the new mechanics 
of Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan were frankly founded on an empirical basis 
As Dirac puts it, in seeking for the new equations, the classical equations were 
to be retained as far as possible and only the operations by which these quantities 
are combined were to be altered 

To gam this freedom to alter multiplication the data were first interpreted 
as matrices Then it was found, by Born and Wiener, that the matrices could 
be interpreted as a special kind of operator, which furnished means to calculate 
the matrices Carl Eckart independently developed a simple operator calculus 
for the solution of the quantum problems In this present work I follow closely 
the paper of Eckart ’’ 

The origin of the new quantum mechanics was an epoch-making paper by 
Werner Heisenberg, in July, 1925 The older quantum theory had postulated 
the existence of stationary states of the atom, which were calculated with the 
aid of the older mechanics In the new mechanics the equations have similar 
form as in the classical theory, but the variables no longer obey the commutative 
law of multiplication In general pq is not equal to qp, {pq =qp and pq —qp =0 

h 

in the classical theory) but pq-qp- — 1, where h represents the Planck con- 

2ir» 

stant, q the generalized co-ordinate, p the momentum, 1 stands for the unit 
matrix, and ir and i have the usual meaning The fact that multiplication is 
not commutatn e in our calculus allows us to give a definite value to the above 
difference and by introducing the Planck constant h, we are enabled to intro- 
duce the quantum conditions in our calculations 

The quantum conditions of the older theory led to an algebraic equation. 
By using the classical equation ivith a non-commutative multiplication law for 
the variables it is possible to perform calculations in the new and wider scheme 
of dynamics The difference between pq and qp is expressed in terms of the 
Planck constant h When li is made to approach zero, pq approaches qp, and 
so we pass to the classical mechanics Thus we sec that the classical mechanics 
appear only as a particular case of this more general theory 

In introducing his theory, Heisenberg pointed out that the older mechanics 
uses quantities which are never observable, and can never be observed, such as, for 
instance, orbital frequencies and amplitudes, or the position and ‘time’ of 
revolution of an ‘electron’ , nhich, as such, have no physical meaning He 
proposes to use observable data, such as the frequencies and intensities of the 
radiations , . Now these frequencies are always differences between two terms 
given by integers If r„ and Tm are two such terms, the observable frequency 
IS theoretically represented by v„m=Tn—Tm Such numbers as v„m characterize 
the atom as far as it is observable It was natuial that such a collection (‘sum’ 
in this case has no longer any physical meaning) of terms could best be 
represented by a matrix In the classical theory a dynamical quantity was

represented structurally by a trigonometrical Fourier senes, in the new, it 
IS represented by a two-dimensional table of values, that is, by a matrix giving 
the frequencies and the intensities of radiations 

An important and interesting structural issue now appears It is that the 
Heisenberg theory gives a new formulation for the hamiltonian equations of 
motion, whereby their form is preserved, yet they are made applicable both to 
periodic and to non-penodic motion It becomes possible to fuse the classical 
mechanics with the quantum mechanics The distinction between ‘quantised’ 
and ‘unquantised’ motion loses all meaning, and a fundamental equation, 
h 

pq—qp = — 1, is formulated which is valid for all motion.

The Heisenberg theory is also characterized by its thoroughly behaviour- 
istic, actional, functional, and operational character The number of unjusti- 
fiable assumptions is the lowest in existence and most of the identifications are 
eliminated. According to Heisenberg, electrons and atoms do not ha\e the 
‘same’ kind of ‘reality’ as ordinary objects of lower order abstractions This con- 
clusion, which underlies his whole work, is of particular importance structurally . 
As we know, differences in character separate different orders of abstraction 
and since the quantum phenomena belong to a higher order of abstraction they 
must differ from objects which belong to a lower order of abstraction In this 
theory the feelings of ‘space’ and ‘time’ are no longer applicable to the ‘inside’ 
of the atom — as might be expected 

The distinction between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ electrons in an atom becomes 
meaningless, since it is impossible to recognize a particular entity among a 
series of similar entities In accordance with the new ‘space-time’ outlook we 
gam a physical basis for the absolute indi\ iduality of some eventual unit 

Because of its structure, the Heisenberg theory is a very fundamental one 
and there is little doubt that the Heisenberg methods will be elaborated further 
and will be kept as a permanent checktng method in physics A theory which is 
thoroughly behaviouristic, with a minimum of assumptions, will probably re- 
main both a most important instrument of research and an inspiration to 
physicists and mathematicians 

The Heisenberg theory, again, because of its structure and method, does 
not lend itself easily to visualization This is not against the theory The 
pictorial representations of lower order abstractions are not to be relied upon. 
Besides, visualization depends on the lower centres and therefore must be rep- 
resented by a macroscopic representation of a continuous (rather than a discrete) 
character, such as waves , 

If we were to try to describe the Heisenberg theory pictorially, which is 
obviously difficult to do, we would have to give a negative description. We 
should have to say that what we observe must be considered only as radiations 
from the location which the atom was supposed to occupy * 

There remains but to mention some more characteristics of the Heisenberg 
theory which seem to have very far-reaching structural and semantic bearings 



716 • X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


This theory appears frankly statistical and introduces fundamental probability 
assumptions The moment we realize that the human organism is essentially 
an abstracting affair and that the abstracting is performed on different levels, 
or in different orders, it becomes obMous tliat statistical methods and proba- 
bility notions become fundamental 

In the earlier dajs we used to assume that statistical laws were laws with 
evceptjons Such an outlook was conditioned by our dealings with macroscopic 
e\ents Now, we anal3se such macroscopic eients m terms of microscopic and 
sub-microscopic events, the statistical laws become accurate laws, not for in- 
dividuals but for groups of individuals Because we abstract in different orders, 
we deal only with statistical data, mass effects of different 'packets' of nervous 
excitement, as is best illustrated by different thresholds in different nervous 
tissues 

The processes in the higher centres, more remote from the external world, 
deal with a special material, no more with statistical data of ‘packets’ and 
ateragcs, but with what we used to call ‘inferences’, ‘inductions’ , which give 
only the probability of happenings But as we ha\e already seen, probabilitj' 
has become a well-developed structural mathematical discipline, which has not 
yet made much effect upon our primiti\e-made macroscopic metaphysics and 
language It should be noticed that the highest activities of the nervous centres 
are based on statistical data furnished by the lower centres So we see that, to 
the best of our knowledge about ourselves and the world around us, a modern 
structural and semantic outlook, in science or in life, must be based on statistical 
and probability methods. 

In space-time eiery point has a date, and therefore in the language of 
space-time all points are different and do not repeat themselves Such structural 
outlook IS, of course, again conditioned, and leads toward the statistical and 
probability methods The mam psj cho-logical importance of the new methods 
is to dimmish affective tension, which is alw'ajs wasteful and harmful In- 
ferences may iniolve belief When belief is too strong, although this is neier 
justified according to the best modern knowledge, we very easily fall into 
identification, delusions, illusions, and the like It should be emphasized that 
the last-mentioned pathological states are ahvays compound They involve at 
least two components One of these consists of some ignorance somewhere, the 
other of strong affectiie belief in the ‘truth’ of our mistaken notions The 
stronger the affective tension is, the more dangerous the semantic disturbance 
becomes 

The Heisenberg theory has succeeded in formulating (verbal) structural 
methods w hich are best suited to represent the experimental facts which underlie 
physics, as well as being structurally m accord with the working of the human 
nervous system That is why I venture to assert that this theory will never 
be abandoned as a checking and research instrument 

In an hypothetical experiment in the quantum field, we may assume what 
may be called a gamma-ray microscope If we were to illuminate an ‘electron’

by gamma-rays, the rays would disturb the e\periment, and m our fundamental 
h 

equation, pg —gi> = — 1, by which the ‘position’ was to be determined, the 
2ir% 

‘momentum’ would thereby be disturbed This change of ‘momentum’ would 
be greater the shorter the wave-length of the rays used, and the shorter the 
wave-length of the ra> , the more accurate the determination of ‘position’ iiould 
be Hence, the more exactly a co-ordinate g could be found, the less exactly 
could its momentum /> be found, and vice versa 

So we have to introduce corrections for errors, and haxe to introduce 
‘mean values’ and ‘probability functions’, which we can develop and compute. 
Lately, Bohr has further de^ eloped the probability aspects of the newer quantum 
mechanics but 1 have not seen this work Heisenberg introduces ‘probability 
packets’ which correspond to the ‘wave packets’ of Schrodmger 

It is difficult to speak briefly, and yet in a satisfactory way, about these 
new developments, and particularly difficult to gi\e credit properly to different 
authors All their works are interwoven and at present they all really work 
together in spite of the fact that historically some of these theories ha\ e been 
developed independently 

What we call today, for the sake of brevity, the Heisenberg theorx', because 
of its originator, has been further developed by Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, and 
others Later, when the wave-mechanics appeared, all the new theories were 
finally fused into a very elaborate and impressive structure 

Historically, PAM Dirac worked at the theory from a different mathe- 
matical point of view, utilizing what is called the ‘Poisson bracket’ method 
In this treatment the difficulties of the matrix calculus were aioidcd He 
introduced dynamical tariables which he called the g numbers These do not 
obey the commutative law of multiplication although the c numbers (classical) 
do. He also considered the difference of the non-commutative products xy —yx, 
where x and y are functions, respectively, of the co-ordinates gi . . q„ and of 
the momenta pi , p, ol ^ multiple periodic system with s degrees of freedom 
Dirac has generalized the matrix theory and the Schrodmger equations. 
His work seems to be most important, in physics and mathematics, but it is 
not possible for us to consider it here in any detail ® 

Let us recall once more that there are fundamental differences between 
the different orders of abstraction, and that we all haxe to abstract in different 
orders From this point of xiexv it is natural that every theory, even if expressed 
at present in a form which cannot be visualized, like the Heisenberg theory or 
the original Dirac theory, has sooner or later to be expressed in a structural 
form which can be visualized These problems have really nothing, or at most 
very little, to do with the xvorld around us They are concerned with the 
neurological structure which produces all theories 

Theories of a structure such as that of the Heisenberg theory are extremely 
important, as already explained, but in them we lose the help of ‘intuition’ 
Now ‘intuition’ (lower centres) has two quite different effects — sometimes it 
leads us astray, but on other occasions it helps greatly. 



718 ' X. ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


An ‘intuitive’ theory has a creative aspect, but always ought later to be 
revised and scrutinized by non-inluiLive means. In fact, because of our nervous 
structure, we should always strive to produce both aspects of theories — ^strive 
consciously — for thus we facilitate progress Historically, we can never com- 
pletely avoid producing both types of theories, as they are inherent in our 
nervous structure and in the different orders of abstractions we produce. 

It is precisely in the newer quantum mechanics that a typical example of 
this simple neurological fact is found The non-intuitive handling of data was 
introduced by Heisenberg the translation of the matrix calculus into opera- 
tional and ‘Poisson brackets’ methods, and, finally, the new ‘wave mechanics’ 
of de Broglie, Schrodinger, and others, gives us a perfect translation into 
intuitive methods 

It should be noticed that according to the old notions such two methods, 
the intuitive and the non-mtuitive, were not supposed to be a neurological 
necessity We still assumed that they were separated ‘absolutely’, and even 
today in many quarters we argue as if they were absolutely separable. If we 
accept the principle of non-elementalism, we realize that this distinction is 
\ erbal only and that the invention of verbal means has little or nothing to do 
with the world around us, but that it depends on human structural ingenuity 

Investigation of the ordered cyclic nerve currents shows unmistakably 
that such sharp differentiation is unjustifiable, and we must conclude, in accord- 
ance with historical experience, that translation from one method to the other 
must be a necessity, and so will be accomplished some day in every field. It is 
true that at present the Einstein theory has not been translated with entire 
success into terms of lower order abstractions This is a task which is facilitated 
by this present work The newer quantum mechanics gives us an unparalleled 
e.\ample of such translation, and hence our main interest should be concentrated 
on this structural aspect. 

On neurological grounds it seems certain that visualization involves in 
some way the lower nerve centres, which again, by evolutionary necessity, 
involve macroscopic forms of representation Our macroscopic experience led 
us to geometrical intuitions These were framed three-dimensionally in ‘absolute 
emptiness', and were impossible m higher dimensions The old structure 
represented a static empty ‘space’ in which nothing could happen and which 
was thus unfit to represent this world around us where something is going 
on everywhere 

The new structure represents ‘fulness’ or a plenum We can visualize it as 
a network of intervals or world-lines and then, by the notions of the differential 
calculus, as already explained, we pass easily to the visualization of the many- 
dimensional space-time world of Minkowski-Einstem Now, in such a world, 
the curves are represented by functions, and, vice versa, functions represent 
curves Thus it is obv’ious that analytical ’non-mtuitive’ methods have ‘in- 
tuitive’ structural geometrical counterparts From this point of view the 
method of operators represents a passing step from the non-intuitive to intuitive 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER’

methods As goon as we have functions, we can represent a functional calculus 
as an operational calculus This involves a more bchaviounstic semantic attitude 
and so leads to the possibility of translation of either method into the other 
Ultimately these are psycho-logical transformations and translations. 

We should not be surprised to find that m the development of the newer 
quantum mechanics the operational calculus plays ]ust such a role 

Now our older macroscopic experience, which affected our lower nerve 
centres, gave rise to the elementary geometrical structural notions of ‘lines’, 
‘surfaces', ‘volumes', . For the building of phj'sics we had to introduce ‘time’, 
‘motion’, . In older daj s we did not realize that these gi\ e us forms of repre- 
sentation and that it is optional with us which forms we will accept as funda- 
mental or use as a starting point. 

The old descriptive apparatus posited structurally an absolute and 
immutable ‘space’ (emptiness), ‘time’, ‘matter’ out of which we built up a 
verbal definition for ‘motion’. The semantic attitude of all of us, scientists 
included, depended upon identification We ascribed lower-centre significance 
to higher-centre abstractions We did not discriminate enough between the 
macroscopic and small scale events So we had ‘geometrical optics’ in which 
we ‘perceived’ a ray of light (in a dusty room, let us say) as a ‘straight line’ 
Further investigation disclosed that the ‘rays’ on one level of abstraction were 
■waves on another, but they were not perceived as waves by the lower centres 

But through our lower centres we had acquaintance with some waves, 
such as in water, so representation for waves was developed A wave-theory 
still remained intuitively workable, even when we dealt with waves which we 
could not see Now the equations of waves are well known. It is then possible 
to translate a non-intuitive matrix mechanics, when vve treat matrices as 
operators, into a functional calculus which has an intuitive geometrical wave 
representation. 

This is precisely what has happened and now, perhaps for the first time 
in human history, we have all the aspects of a theory being worked out simul- 
taneously, with mutual co-operation of all workers and the use of methods 
which are mutually complementary fiom the neurological side There seems 
little risk m predicting that because of these neurological factors the newer 
quantum mechanics will giv'e extremely rapid and far-reaching results 'U'hen 
scientists become aware of the structural semantic and neurological issues 
involved, perhaps such achievements wnll be multiplied consciously, instead of 
being a kind of coincidence 

Personally, I am convinced that these new achievements arc not simply 
coincident. It seems that the abolishment of the old, el, static ‘absolute space’ 
and ‘absolute time’ has relieved the younger scientists from a semantic blockage. 
This release was due to the bold stroke of genius of Einstein in refusing to use 
the vicious aristotelian ‘is’ of identity As soon as we realize that words are not 
the objective levels, we gam an unconscious semantic freedom in handling words, 
as words At once this freedom is bound to produce many different forms of

representation for e\ ents, according to the personal make-up of the individual 
workers. And of course these forms can be translated into one another 

Section F The wave mechanics. 

We have not sufficient space at our disposal to discuss more fully the new 
wave mechanics I found that short of a small \ olume, no explanations, readily 
intelligible, could be made 

In mathematics and phjsics, which represent the most developed sciences, 
we consciously and unconsciously stn\ e for more and more general formulations 
The work of Einstein, showing that the classical mechanics was onl> a particular 
case of a more general mechanics, has guen a healthy stimulation to such a 
fruitful line of work 

As the quantum phenomena could not be accounted for by the old me- 
chanics, It was natural that physiasts should try schemes of new mechanics 
which included classical mechanics as a particular case Thus, Sommerfeld, 
through his methods of the application of the Einstein theory to the quantum 
mechanics and his generalizations of phase-space, and his treatment of the 
relation of wave-optics to ray -optics and of the relation of mechanics to ra> - 
optics, came close to the discotery of the wave mechanics 

The new wave mechanics originated in 1924 m Pans, with the thesis of 
Louis de Broglie, published in 1925, and republished in a book form in 1926 
The controversy between the corpuscular light theory of Newton (emission 
theory) and the wave theory of Huygens is well known The emission theory 
had Its support in the ‘rectilinear’ propagation of light, which followed from 
the inertia of light particles Also, it explained the reflection and the refrac- 
tion , of light, but failed in other respects It is true that the wave theory 
also had its weak structural spots In it the ‘rectilinear’ propagation of light 
remained a complete m> stery and it completely failed to account for the dis- 
persion of light, until this was explained on the electron theory 

Both theories assumed the periodicity of light phenomena, but the ac- 
ceptance of one theory was generally held to mean the rejection of the other 
It did not occur to many that both theories might be correct but only partial 
structural aspects of a more general theory 

With the advent of the quantum theory of Planck (1900) new methods 
were found In 1905 Einstein propounded his theory of ‘light quanta' success- 
fully He assumed that radiation occurs in discrete quanta of energy hv, where 
V represents the frequency From this point of Mew the quantum had the 
characteristic discreteness of a corpuscle, and jet the frequency characteristic 
of a wave W’e see that the new theory invoUed a kind of a blend of the two 
older theories 

De Broglie generalized still further the abo\ e notions His theory is in a 
way the result of the theory of Einstein As we already know, Einstein shows 
the connection of mass and energy, so that the conservation of mass becomes 
also the conservation of energy, and vice versa Starting with these premises 
de Broglie concluded that if any element, in the most general sense, be it an

electron or proton or light quantum or -what not, has energy W, there must be 
in the system a periodic phenomenon of frequency v, defined by W =liv From 
this point of view all forms of energy, radiation included, must have an atomic 
structure and the atoms of energy must be grouped around certain points, 
forming what we call ‘electrons', 'light quanta', . 

Applying the Lorentz-Einstein transformation, he finds a rather startling 
fact — that the frequency associated with any assumed mass wo, namely, 

Vo =— ° — I represents no more and no less than a periodic phenomenon, analogous 
h 

to a stationary wave, which spreads around the point of which the mass is a 
singularity “ 

In other words, a ‘mass particle’ at rest is the centre of a pulsation through- 
out the spread, or otherwise it is a singulanty of the pulsation The quantity 
which pulsates is called and ipip is interpreted as the electric density, where if 
is the conjugate of the complex quantity 

In the Minkowski representation, the abo\e 
astonishing result becomes quite simple, and we 
can see clearly how simultaneous pulsations be- 
come travelling waves In Fig 2, we give a two- 
dimensional diagram of space-time OXa is the 
‘space’ co-ordinate, OTa the ‘time’ (.uk) co-ordi- 
nate ipi, i/ 2 , ih represent the traces of the sur- 
faces of constant phase which are perpendicular 
to OTo The Lorentz-Einstein transformation is 
equivalent to the transformation from rectangular 
system XitOTo to the rectangular system XOT, 
forming an angle 6. In the new system the lines 
i'll ’/'ii V'3 • • 1 are no longer parallel to the X 
axis and so represent a moving wavefront. In this 
new system the if -lines represent the moving wave 
front for different points, F, P' , on one phase 
line and have different values of t The smaller the velocity («) of the 
particle, the smaller the angle 6 and the greater the distance PQ traielled by 
the phase in a given 'time', P'Q or Af, which means the greater the phase \ elocity u. 

The frequency of these pulsations or waves is the ‘total energy of the 
particle’ divided by Planck's constant, h In symbols, Ai'=««;^-|-potential 
energy, where

The problem before us is to connect structurally, the waves with two ob. 
servations, one of the radiations, the other of what we call the ‘material particles’ 
Our interest at present lies only in the connection with the latter. Ac- 
cording to this theory, the ‘region occupied by the particle’ is only a region 
16 



722 * 


X ON THE STRUCTURE OF ‘MATTER’ 


where a set of ^-waves, which \ ary continuously in direction and in frequency 
in a small lange, reinforce each other to give a wave-group tiavelling with what 
we usually call ‘the velocity of the particle’ 

As the waves have different frequencies, they travel with different veloci- 
ties and so we have to face the problem of the dispersing medium, where, ac- 
cording to classical theories, the region of reinforcement has a velocity different 
from that of the phase The ordinary expression for ‘group velocity’ gives, on 
the wa% e interpretation, the magnitude of the 'velocity of the particle’ 

That which, in the classical theories, we called the ‘motion of the particle’ 
IS represented by the motion of the region of reinforcement of \^-waies The 
direction of motion is represented by the direction of a ray-, or wave-normal. 
The particular ray selected as the position of the ‘path of the particle’ is repre- 
sented by the ra> cut in coinciding phase by a set of ^-waves with slightly 
varying directions The ‘position of the particle’ is given by the small region 
occupied by the group of waves of slightly different frequencies and velocities 
In this connection we should notice an important point which is necessi- 
tated b> the methods of generalization and of translation from macroscopic to 
sub-microscopic e\ ents and \ ice x ersa Schrodinger, by formulating the dif- 
ferential equations for the tf'-waxes, has brought out clearly the important 
structural point that wave mechanics bears a similar relationship to classical 
mechanics of particles as wase-optics bears to ray-optics 

Here again we have the macroscopic phenomena capable of being treated by 
mathematical methods different from those used fbr the small-scale phenomena. 

In classical mechanics the state of a system whose co-ordinates were 
?i <?« and whose momenta W'cre pi ps, was represented by a point in a 
2i-dimensionaI g-spread and the changes m the system were represented by the 
passage of the point along some curv'e, a ‘ray’, so to say 

Schrodinger regards the classical mechanics as only an approximation, 
w hile rigorous treatment must be made by the aid of wave mechanics 

The large-scale, or macroscopic, mechanical processes correspond to a 
wave signal in the g-spread and can be regarded as a point in comparison with 
the geometrical structure of the path In small-scale phenomena, such as the 
atomic processes, a rigorous W'a\ e formulation must be used 

This analysis can be carried further and Hamil ton knew well and used the 
analogy between mechanics and geometrical optics The Hamilton variation 
principle, Sj’Ldt=0, is Fermat’s prmciple for a wave motion, the Hamilton- 
Jacobi equation expresses Huygens’ principle for wave motion, and the new 
wave mechanics expresses the Kirchhoff analysis of physical optics As Huygens' 
principle could deal w ith the problems of physical optics up to a certain point, 
so the Hamil ton-Jacobi equations could deal with atomic problems up to a 
certain point At the exact wave analysis of Kirchhoff was needed to clear up 
the finer points of physical optics, so the new wave mechanics is required for 
the exact solution of the atomic problems 

A detailed analysis shows that classical mechanics was associated with 
geometrical optics (ray-optics). Obviously, a more exact system of mechanics 



THE NEWER ‘MATTER-

would be one associated with wave-optics, which would give the classical results 
111 all cases where the wave-length was negligible in comparison with the dimen- 
sions of the path Schrodinger suggests that a correct extension of the analogy 
would be to regard the wave system as sine-waves In this connection it should 
be recollected that Fourier has shown that any given form of waves can be 
represented by the superposition of stne-viaves, and that therefore a sme-wave 
>(see Chapter XXXII) may be considered as a general formulation 

The ray methods in physics worked only to some extent, that is to say, in 
the cases where the radii of curvature of such rays and the dimensions of the 
spreads were large in comparison with the wave-length When this is not the 
case we have to consider waves and not rays Naturally, dealing with atomic 
dimensions, which are very small, instead of using the paths of the particles 
■or the ^-rays, we have to use the ^-waves It appears that this difference was 
the main, rather puzzling distinction betiveen the classical mechanics and the 
quantum mechanics, between the macroscopic theories and the sub-microscopic 
ones 

The above realization, and its formulation into a mathematical theory, 
seems to be an important and extremely fruitful geneialization, which probably 
will be retained as a method 

One of the puzzling features of the quantum theory was the structural 
appearance of the whole-number laws of the ‘orbits’ That some such whole- 
number relation is justified seems to be well established, yet it contradicted 
the older ‘continuous’ mechanics A new theory, to be at all satisfactory, 
should be able to fit these whole-number empirical data The first test of the 
new wave mechanics, and also its first success, was precisely in this field 

If a ray of the wave was supposed to run around in a circle for a stationary 
state, the circumference must be a whole mulhple of the wave-length, or 

- . A , k 

2irr = HA = n — , and mvr = w — 
mv Itt 

where n is an integer We see that the quantum condition of the Bohr theory, 
that the angular momentum must be a whole multiple of hjlir, is only the 
result of the requirement that the wave-function ^ shall be single-valued, 
which is another way of sajmg that the arcumfcrence (2irr) must contain a 
whole number of wave-lengths It may be compared perhaps with waves 
travelling around a circular loop of string If they travelled both ways we 
would have stationary waves 

At this point a very important structural feature of the new wave mechanics 
makes its appearance In the abo\ e interpretation the 'velocity of the electron’ 
has lost its physical meaning, it becomes simply the wave length of the ^t-waves 
In the wave mechanics, as well as in the matrix mechanics, there is no meaning 
to the older ‘position of an electron on its orbit’ So the wave mechanics again 
embodies the advantages of the matnx mechanics by not postulating entities 
which can never be observed The whole numbers, as Schrodinger remarks, 
‘appear as naturally as do “integers” in the theory of vibrating strings’. In 
the theory of string vibrations these whole numbers are determined by certain

boundary conditions which have to be satisfied by the solution of a differential 
equation. In the new waie mechanics there is also a differential equation 
representing the Schrodinger nave equation ** 

Section G. Structural aspects of the new theories 

We should notice the important distinction between the two structural 
tj pes of these theories The evtensional matrix theory can hardly be t isualized, 
with all the consequent advantages and disadvantages. The wave mechanics 
can be Msualized From what we already know of the structure and working 
of the nen'ous s>stem, \\e see that the waie mechanics mil have a creative 
clement and the matrix mechanics mil remain an important checking method 
. At present, all these new theories seemingly have blended or perhaps it 
would be better to say that they have been translated from one language to 
another and all the workers in this field work from all angles. 

It should be mentioned also, that Einstein, Bose, Jordan, and others, work 
from the point of view of statistics, and that these methods, too, are being 
retranslated and connected with the rest of the new theories. 

The new wave mechanics evades the difficulties of the matnv calculus and 
brings the new mechanics within the scope of the highly developed anal>sis 
of the theorj of differential equations It also enlists the creative aspects of 
'intuition', Sisualization', 

Concluding our consideration of the subject, three remarkable aspects of 
the wave mechanics must be referred to We are already acquainted with the 
terra 'action'. It appears that the main point of the passing from the old 
mechanics to the new was the stroke of genius of de Broglie, when he divided 
action by the fundamental constant h with some definite numerical factor 
which then gives us the phase. In the expression for -p, the energy appears as 
the 'time' component of a space-time vector whose 'space' components are 
those of the momentum When this vector is divided by h, its components 
become the frequency, or the number of waves which each axis cuts per 
centimetre. 

These are the methods by which we can use differential equations, whereby 
the older discontinuities disappear and the particle is represented as a group 
of reinforcing waves 

From this point of view we also come to the conclusion that the 'conserva- 
tion of energy', which was very valuable in the old days, is perhaps only a 
gross macroscopic generalization and will give place to a newer and more 
fundamental notion of the conservation of frequency or 'times’ 

It has been already mentioned that the newer mechanics must be repre- 
sented m accordance with statistical data, probabilities, with due attention paid 
to the theory of errors , . While these requirements have very little to do w'lth 
the w'orld around us, they are unconditionally required by our nerv ous structure, 
which IS, after all, the geneial author of all our 'knowledge' and ‘theories’ 
Let us be candid about it, there is no such thing as ‘knowledge’ outside of a 
nervous system, and therefore the neurological requirements, as already

mentioned, become paramount The newer theories bnlliantly satisfy this 
requirement 

As an example, we may perhaps mention an aspect of the wave mechanics 
theory which is not at present settled, but which remains just as interesting 
Schrodinger shows that in highly excited states a suitably chosen group 
of waves represents a ‘wave packet', which behaves like a point-mass of the 
ordinary mechanics It oscillates with frequency vo in a rectilinear path. The 
number and breadth of the wa\es which form the packet vary with the ‘time’, 
but the width of the packet remains constant The remarkable part about the 
shape of the curve is that it represents the Gauss error curve 
Heisenberg has shown 
that this result is only acci- 
dentally true, but for our 
purpose of illustration this 
IS quite enough 

The newer quantum 
mechanics has shown once 
more the necessity for a 
re-analjsis of our funda- 
mental notions From a 
space- time point of view, -vihich seems to be a permanent acquisition of science, 
since it IS a language and method of structure closer related to the external 
world than the older languages and methods, it seems beyond dispute that 
eten macroscopic phenomena are the results of repeated observation. Now, 
such a point of view, although it is extremely plausible, and close to neurological 
and physical data, necessitates a complete reconstruction of our describing 
apparatus, which is not adapted to such an outlook 

The problem of ‘observation’ enters Bohr suggests, and rightly, that this 
vocabularly is strictly connected \iith the older ‘causal’ vocabulary One of 
the mam points of the present work is to draw attention to the multwrdinal 
mechanism and terms and to show that the analysis of these problems cannot 
be e\en attempted without first analysing the structure of our languages, of 
our ‘knowledge’, and the neurological and semantic aspects which such analysis 
invol\ es 

When this analysis is carried through we see that the problems of ‘con- 
tinuity’ and ‘discontinuity’ lose their absolute character They become verbal 
problems, to be solved through the ingenuity of some one who will suggest 
the solutions. 

The newer quantum mechanics give us ample material for work on these 
problems, but they also illustrate a much more general and important problem, 
which is the subject matter of the present book, namely, that all ‘knowledge’ 
IS structural, strictly dependent on the nertous structure and functioning, 
and the language we use ‘Method’ is that aspect of the search for structure 
which deals with the most expedient means for finding structure Since words 
are not the things we speak about, the study of linguistic structure becomes a

most important research method The more languages (theories) we have for 
analysis and structural comparison, the more glimpses do we get at the structure 
of the world The newer quantum mechanics gi\ e us enormous material of a 
linguistic, structural, and semantic character 

It IS natural that this wisdom can come only from the study of the structure 
of the highest de\ eloped languages in existence, which are mathematical 
languages If we want progress in any line of human endeavour, this progress 
IS always dependent on the languages we use, since what we call 'progress’ is 
a co-operative affair and therefore dependent on means of communications 
and languages 

From the point of \iew of structure, we deal with a world of absolute tn- 
dimdiiah and therefore our languages must be such as to reflect such individu- 
ality We already know that this involves an extensional attitude and methods, 
which historically have produced mathematics as the only language which as 
yet reflects in structure the world around us 

With the newer quantum mechanics, the old 'discontinuity' resolves itself 
into an essential individuality, as noticed by Bohr, perfectly foreign to the 
older theories 

History proves that we were slow in arriving at that point Our tragedies 
began when the 'intensional' biologist Aristotle took the lead over the ‘ex- 
tensional' mathematical philosopher Plato, and formulated all the pnmitive 
identifications, subject-predicativism , into an imposing system, which for 
more than two thousand years we weie not allowed to revise under penalty of 
persecution Mathematics was not particularly encouraged, but at least, not 
persecuted, so that it was developed into the present day great linguistic system. 
The theory of function involves semantic factors of non-identification 

The invention of the differential and the integral calculi, represents the 
two great structural and psycho-logical aspects of analysis and differentiation, 
versus synthesis and integration 

The application of these methods led us to differential geometries, to 
methods of treating 'fulness', and to 'contact' methods 'Fulness' necessitated 
geometries of higher dimensions, impossible in ‘absolute emptiness', and so the 
fusion of geometry with physics became possible The four-dimensional world 
of Minkowski and the theory of Einstein finally achieved this fusion The 
next step was the in\ention of the new quantum mechanics, where all these 
important, nay, all-important, structural, semantic, and linguistic achievements 
find their culmination The old primitive metaphysics become too 'materialistic' 
for an enlightened age 

Without legislating about the 'truth' or 'falsehood' of the newer mechanics, 
as a matter of human behaviour these theories are the best indications and 
examples of the structure of human 'knowledge', which I have attempted to 
formulate in this work as a general theory 

The A -system was strictly interconnected with primitive-made structural 
assumptions or metaphysics, reflected in the structure of the older languages 
and in the el notions about language, ‘psychology', 'logic', and the pre-scicntific

anthropomorphic astronomy, physics, and other disciplines Of late, science 
has developed in spite of all handicaps and persecutions, and has begun to de- 
part structurally and semantically from the path of aristotelianism and the 
dark ages. Every science has had to build its own language and this fact com- 
pletely condemns the A language, which, it is shocking to notice, we continue 
to preserve in our daily life 

Should we wonder that we have shown hardly any progress at all in our 
purely human affairs and notions'' We should wonder, rather, that we have 
been able to sur\ ivc until now — though with needless difficulties and suffering 
More wars, more revolutions, more insanity, more morons, more struggle and 
competition, and more unhappiness are what we are entitled to e\.pect and 
ptedict as the outcome of this structurally and semantically impossible situation. 

As the organism works as-a-whole, such things as ‘pure intellect’ or ‘pure 
emotions’ represent structurally el fictions and scientists should realize that 
their professed detached scientific attitude is profoundly and fundamentalK 
unjustified All saence has ‘emotional’ components, which play most important 
roles in life If we live in a modern world, but keep the 'einolional attitudes' of 
primitive bygone days, then naturally we are bound to be semantically un- 
balanced, and cannot be adjusted to a fundamentally primitive ‘civilization’ 
in the midst of great technical achievements When scientists understand that, 
then the layman will have a different attitude tow ard science He vv ill under- 
stand that science is not a privilege of the few, something without effect upon 
all and every one He will realize that while he lives in a modern world, made so 
by science, structural ignorance of the fundamentals as discovered by science 
leaves him vvith primitive structural assumptions or metaphysics, which by 
necessity build for him a delusional world leading to semantic unbalance and 
ultimately to ‘mental’ and nervous ills. 

From the non-elementahshc {Joint of view, the only escape is to realize that 
ignorance in an adult is, and must be, pathological, because ‘knowledge’ is to 
be considered as a normal characteristic of human nervous tissue 

A special structural and methodological brief and simplified account of 
scientific achievements, such as I have attempted in this work, must be a part 
of a theory of sanity Sanity means adjustment and without the minimum of 
the best structural knowledge of each date concerning this world, such adjust- 
ment is impossible 

It is not necessary that the reader should fully understand all technical 
details of a theory, to be aware (instinctive, affective ,) of the e\istcnceol the 
structural and semantic problems and to realize that some of the most competent 
and skilled professionals are working at these theories Such awareness ha= 
great pacifying semantic influence, it eliminates the older affective tensions 
which were due to identifications, absolutism, dogmatism, flights into mystic- 
ism, and other similar pathological disturbances

A non-anslotehan system must deal with all these structural and semantic 
issues It IS hoped that once a j4"S>stem is presented to the public, scientists 
and laymen will become more interested in the structural and semantic issues 
emphasized here, and that new and wider researches will be undertaken 

History shows that such hopes are not illusory The greatest men of 
science ha\e always had wide human aims and interests From the non-ele- 
mentahstic point of viciv, they probably became products e geniuses because of 
this broad human urge From the point of \iew of psychiatry, it is well known 
that 'mental' ills inioKe usually anti-social alTecti\e attitudes When we see 
men with distinctly anti-social tendencies, no matter how they rationalize them, 
they are in\ ariably ill in some way A fully healthy individual is never anti- 
social 

That science should include structural and semantic factors of sanity may 
be a startling notion, but only at first' In the present analysis this turns out 
to be, rather unexpectedly, a necessity But on second consideration we should 
rather expect it Science and mathematics show the working of the ‘human 
mind' at its best Accordingly, we can learn from science and mathematics how 
this ‘human mind’ should work, to he at its best Then we should make an 
analysis of science and mathematics from some wider structural and semantic 
point of view, — the task which has been undertaken in the present work. 

At this early stage it is, of course, of comparatively little importance to 
what e-xtent this analysis turns out to be satisfactory. The mam point is that 
It has been originated. If the present author fails, others, perhaps even because 
of his failure, may*be stimulated to do it better The great and x’ltal thing is 
that It should be done, by someone

THE LOGIC OF RELATIVITY 
BY R. D Casmichael 


In order to be able to deal with such quantities as are involved in the 
measurement of motion, time, velocity, etc , or indeed m the quantitative 
analysis of any physical phenomena, it is necessary to have some system or 
systems of reference with respect to which measurements can be made Let us 
consider any set of things consisting of objects and any kind of physical quanti- 
ties whatever, as electric charges or magnets or light-sources or telescopes or 
other objects and instruments, each of which is at rest with respect to each of 
the others Let us suppose that among the objects are clocks, to be used for 
measuring time, and rods or rules to be used for measuring length, and that 
time and length may be measured at any desired instant and any assigned 
place. Such a set of objects and quantities and instruments, including the 
equipment for measuring time and length, all being at rest relatively to each 
other, we shall call a sj stem of reference Such a s> stem we shall denote by S. 
In case we have to deal at once with two or more systems of reference we shall 
denote them by 5, S', Si, Si, . . 

In this definition of systems of reference nothing specific has been said 
about the units of length and of tunc If we were dealing with our usual prin- 
ciples of mechanics we might pass ov er such a matter v\ ithout any feeling of 
difficulty about it, it would be sufficient to proceed in accordance with our 
intuitive conceptions of time and length But in the theory of rclaliv ity these 
appear in a new light We can not proceed wnth confident dependenee upon our 
intuition. On the other hand we shall not attempt to give explicit definitions 
of units of time and length We shall pioceed from certain principles or postu- 
lates, presently to be stated, to an analysis of time and length and so arrive at 
a suitable precision of these conceptions by means of certain guiding principles. 
It will be seen that it is not far from the truth to say that our fundamental 
terms are defined implicitly and indirectly by means of the statements made 
about them and accepted initially as valid and that they may mean anj thing 
which is consistent with the truth of these fundamental principles and postulates 
The restneted principle of relativity may now be stated in the following 
form. 

Restricted Principle of Relativity. If and St are two systems of 
reference having with respect to each other a uniform unaccelerated motion, then 
natural phenomena run their course with respect to Si in accordance with precisely 
the same general laws as with respect to Si 

This principle says nothing about the suitability of any particular system 
of reference for the convenient expression of the laws of nature, but it does say 

729 



730 


SUPPLEMENT I 


that if either 5i or 52 is suitable the other is equally suitable, the relative motion 
of the two being unaccelerated 

In order to bring into suitable relations the measurements made on one 
system of reference and those made on another it is necessary to have some 
agreement as to the correspondence of units on the two systems. Accordingly 
e shall make the following assumption concerning the correspondence of units 

Principle of Correspondence of Units The units of any tuio systems 
Si and S2 are such that the same numerical result will he obtained in measuring 
with the units of Si a quantity Li and with the units of S2 a quantity L2 when the 
relation of Li to Si is precisely the same as that of L2 to S2 

We shall agree that the restricted prmaple of relativity is to be understood 
in a sense which implies this assumption concerning the correspondence of units, 
that IS, the latter will be taken as a more precise formulation of a part of the 
content of the former It is clear that the possibility of realizing this latter is 
taken for granted in the Galileo-Newtoman mechanics, it is often passed over 
without remark although it is a profound fact and is a part of the essential 
basis of any theory of motion 

It IS a grave question whether the restricted principle of relativity can be 
maintained in the interpretation of natural phenomena Indeed in the more 
general theory of relativity, to be taken up later, it is treated merely as a sort 
of appro.Miiiation to a more comprehensive principle — an approximation strictly 
1 alid only in the absence of a grai itational field but very close to the truth for 
a wide variety of phenomena including most of those which are purely terrestrial. 

There are two particular characteristic postulates, or ‘laws of nature’, 
1> ing at the base of the restricted theory of 1 elatn ity These may be stated as 
follows 

Postulate M The unacceleraled motion of a system of reference S can not 
be detected by observations made on S alone, the units of measurement being those 
belonging to S 

Postulate R The velocity of light, in free space, measured on an unac- 
celerated system of reference S by means of units belonging to S, is independent of 
the velocity of S and of the unaccelerated velocity of the light-source. 

For these two particular postulates there is the strongest possible experi- 
mental evidence Eierj thing known points toward their truth, and there is 
nothing known which in any way seems to be in disagreement with them. It 
is to be observed that they apply only to the ideal case, that is, the case in which 
there is supposed to be no gravitational field 

For the development of the restricted theory of relativity there are three 
additional necessary postulates, or ‘laws of nature,’ those that theory shares 
m common with the Gahleo-Newtonian mechanics Such assumptions in some 
form are essential to the initial arguments and to the conclusions which are 
drawn by means of them To the present writer it seems to be preferable to 
have these assumptions explicitly stated. They may be put into the following 
form' 



THE LOGIC OF RELATIVITY 


731 


Postulate V If the velocity of a system of reference Si relative to a system 
•of reference Si ts measured by means of the units belonging to Si and tf the velocity 
of Si relative to 52 is measured by means of the units belonging to Si the two results 
will agree in numerical value. 

Postulate T If two systems of reference Si and S 2 move with unaccelerated 
relative velocity and if a body moves relatively to one of the systems in a straight 
line with unaccelerated velocity then it also moves in a straight line relatively to the 
other and with unaccelerated velocity 

Postulate L. If two systems of reference Si and S 2 move with unaccelerated 
I elative velocity and if a line segment I is perpendicular to the hue of relative motion 
of Si and Si and is fixed to one of these systems, then the length of I measured by 
means of the units belonging to Si will be the same as its length measured by means 
of the units belonging to Si 

We now have before us the logical basis upon w hich may be built the re- 
stricted theory of relativity in all its details It has been put in essentially the 
same form as that employed in my “Theory of Relativity” (published by Wiley 
and Sons, New York) and in my earlier articles in "The Physical ReMew”. 
Reference may be made to the book named for the detailed development of the 
theory. Here we shall attempt to sketch only the progress of ideas and to 
indicate the main conclusions 

The first thing to be done in developing the theory on this basis is to 
consider carefully the relation between the time units of the two systems The 
following remarkable conclusion is reached by a process of reasoning which is 
fully cogent in character 

If two systems of reference 5i and Si move with a relative velocity v and 
/3 is the ratio v/c of v to the velocity c of light as measured on either system, 
then to an observer on Si the time unit of Si appears to be in the ratio 1 

to that which is described to him as a unit by an observer on 52 while to an 
observer on Si the time unit of 52 appears to be in the ratio 1 —fi- 1 to that 
which is described to him as a unit by the observer on 5i 

Thus we have the extraordinary conclusion that the time units of the 
two systems of reference 5i and 52, not at rest relatively to each other, are of 
different lengths in such a way that an observer on either sjstcm thinks that 
the time unit of the other sjstem is greater than his own It is evident that 
no simple change of the unit on either system (or both) will bring the units 
into agreement for observers on both systems As postulates V and L and T 
are generally accepted and have not elsewhere led to such strange conclusions 
it is natural to suppose that the strangeness here is not due to them In the 
argument the restricted principle of relativity needs to be used only in so far 
as it is involved in the conclusion that the units of any two systems of reference 
Si and 52 are such that the same numencal result is obtained in measuring 
with the units of Si a quantity Li and with the units of 52 a quantity Li when 
the relation of Li to 5i is precisely the same as the relation of Li to Si But 
this principle is accepted in the classical mechanics and has not elsewhere 
led to strange results The conclusion in postulate M appears to be demanded 



732 


SUPPLEMENT I 


by the strongest experimental evidence, it is generally accepted, if the strange 
element in the result concerning units of time is due to this postulate, it appears 
that we must accept it as being required by such experience as has already 
been tested with due care Hence the conclusion seems to be inevitable that 
the strangeness in our result is due pnncipally to postulate R 

We shall presently see that the same basis of postulates leads to the con- 
clusion that corresponding units of length in the two systems are also different 
when taken in certain directions From the transformations of time and space 
which result from the conclusions thus obtained the whole restricted theory 
of relativity may be deduced (as is shown in the book mentioned) Therefore 
this theory depends essentially on the principle of correspondence of units in 
two systems of reference and on the propositions set forth explicitly in the 
postulates; and all of these are either generalizations from experiment or 
statements of laws which have usually been accepted Hence we conclude 
The restricted theory of relativity may he developed by logical processes from the 
generalized results of certain experiments together with certain laws which have 
for a long time been accepted. 

The main result concerning the relation of units of length may be put 
in the following form 

If two systems of reference Si and Sz move with a relative velocity v and 
if 0 IS the ratio v/c of v to the veloaty c of light as measured on either system, 
then' to an observer on 5i the unit of length of 5i along the line of relative 
motion appears to be in the ratio V 1 — j3^ 1 to that which is described to 
him as a unit by an observer on ^2 while to an obscr\ er on 52 the unit of length 
of 52 along the line of relatn e motion appears to be in the ratio "s / 1 — /3“ 1 to 
that which is described to him as a unit by the observ er on 5i 

These remarkable ronclusions concerning units of length in two systems 
of reference rest on just those postulates which led to the strange results as 
to the units of time 

What often impresses one as the most remarkable conclusion in the theory 
of relativity is one which implies that the notion of simultaneity of events 
happening at different places is indefinite in meaning until some convention 
IS adopted as to how simultaneity is to be determined In fact, there is no such 
thing as absolute simultaneity of events happening at different places With 
respect to the measured time and space of physics we must conclude that 
time does not run its course independently of space Measured time and space 
are indissolubly bound together. 1 he theorem which sets this forth most 
concretely may be stated in the following way. 

Let two systems of reference 5i and 52 have an unaccelerated relative 
velocity v Let an observer on Sz place two clocks m the line of relative motion 
of 5i and 52 and adjust them so that they appear to him to mark simultaneously 
the same time. Then to an observer on 5i the clock on Sz which is forward 
in point of motion appears to be behind in point of time by the amount

where c is the velocity of light, =vlc, and d is the distance between the two 
clocks as measured by the observer on S\ 

By means of the foregoing theorems we may readily obtain the formulae 
for the celebrated Lorentz transformation of space and time coordinates 
(The non-mathematical reader may omit the remainder of this paragraph ) 
Let two systems of reference 5 and S' have the relative velocity v in the line 1. 
Let systems of rectangular coordinates be attached to the systems of reference 
S and S' in such a way that the *-axis of each system is in the line I and that 
the two t-axes have the same positive direction, and let the y-avis and the 
z-axis of one system be parallel to the y-axis and z-axis respectively of the 
other system and have their positive senses in the same directions Let these 
two systems of axes coincide at the time zero Furthermore, for the sake of 
distinction, denote the space and time coordinates on 5 by r, y, z, t, and those 
on S' by x!, y', z', t' Let us suppose that S' moves with respect to 5 in the 
direction of increasing values of x. Then it turns out that the foregoing 
theorems imply the following relations between the two systems of coordinates:

where and c is the velocity of light. 

The foregoing theorems, or (in more compact language) the foregoing 
equations of transformation, furnish the effective means for developing the 
whole of the restneted theory of relativity Our purpose does not require us 
to follow that development further m detail But we may mention a few of 
the remarkable conclusions which now emerge readily If two velocities, each 
of which IS less than c, are combined the resultant velocity is also less than c 
The mass of a body increases with an increase in its velocity relative to the 
system on which the mass is measured The mass of a body at rest appears 
to be the measure of its internal energy Mass and energy in general appear 
to be essentially convertible terms The velocity of light is a maximum which 
the velocity of a material body may approach but can never equal or exceed. 

The development by Einstein m 1905 of the foregoing restricted theory 
of relativity led to a fresh analysis of the whole foundations of physics. This 
was made inevitable by its effective attack upon such fundamental notions as 
those of length and time and mass and velocity. Einstein himself succeeded 
in 1915 in greatly extending the range of his theory, developing what has since 



734 


SUPPLEilENT I 


been called the general theory of relativity We shall now speak briefly con- 
cerning the foundations underlying the latter 

Already in the restricted theory time and space had become essentially 
blended so that \ie could no longer speak of a three-dimensional space as 
separate and apart from the one dimension of time A sort of combination of the 
two came into our conception and we began to realize that they can not be 
disentangled by the measurements of physics We are forced to consider a 
four-dimensional continuum of space and time It is with this space-time 
extension of four-dimensions that the general theory of relativity has essentially' 
to do, and its problems are intimately connected with the relations of two 
systems of reference of the generalized sort which this makes necessary' The 
Lorentz transformation was a great psychological (and even logical) aid in 
the formation of the new theory. 

Let us consider a four-dimensional extension in which space and time are 
intimately connected and blended so that each point P in these four dimension® 
represents a definite place ^4 at a definite time t at which A is to be considered 
In the course of time a material particle is represented by a succession of these 
points P. All these points for a given material particle he on what is called the 
"world-line" of that particle, and this world-line represents the state of motion 
(or eventually the state of rest) of the material particle If two objects come 
into coincidence at an instant their world-lines have a corresponding inter- 
section The things which the physicist deals with ultimately are these inter- 
sections of world-lines 

In order to deal with them he finds it necessary to introduce certain ref- 
erence numbers which we may call the coordinates vi, \i, xs, xt These numbers 
change in such a way that their variation along any world-lme is continuous 
and that no two points ever have the same ordered set of four numbers assigned 
to them This gives us a lery general set of coordinates It is clear that co- 
ordinates can be set up in an immense -variety of ways so as to have these few 
very general properties One of the first problems in the general theory of 
relativity is that of the character of the transformation by means of which we 
can pass from a given choice .\i, \i, xj, 14 of coordinates to a second one fi, fj, 
fs, ^4 It is clear that we must have relations of the form 

=/t (-* 1 , ^ 2 , 13, V 4 ), 2 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 

where the functions/, of the variables Xi, X3, X4 are rather general functions 
of these four arguments and are indeed to a large extent arbitrary Now suppose 
that the laws of nature are expressed in terms of the coordinates x and also in 
terms of the coordinates f , the question arises as to what relation one ought to 
expect between these two forms of the law Now there are no coordinates in 
nature These have been inserted by us for our convenience What is more 
natural, then, than the demand that we shall formulate our statements of these 
laws so that they shall have the same form in these two systems of reference, 
and indeed in all possible systems of reference? This is precisely one of the 
fundamental basic requirements upon which Einstein insists The corresponding

principle he has called the principle of covariance In detailed and precise form, 
it may be stated somewhat as follows 

Principle of Covariance The laws of nature can be (and are to be) ev- 
pressed tn such mathematical form tn terms of the space-and-time coordinates xi, 
* 2 , * 3 , *4 that they shall remain invariant under every transformation of the form 
fx ~fi (^If A 3 , xf)f 2 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 
where the functions f are subject to the following conditions 

1) They are (apart from exeeptional points or regions of fewer than four 
dimensions) finite and continuous and indefinitely differentiable, 

2) They are such that the transformation is uniquely reversible, the inverse 
transformation having the properties demanded for the direct transformation, 

3) They are such that in both the transformation and its inveise the fourth 
variable has the character of a time variable while the other three have the character 
of space variables. 

This principle demands the attainment of an ideal which is admittedly 
mathematical in its character By means of it alone one could not come to gnps 
with phenomena. One needs some additional hypotheses One of these is to 
the effect that the restricted theory of relativity is valid in free space, that is, 
in space free of a gravitational field The other is the celebrated law of the 
equivalence of gravitational forces and the apparent forces due to acceleration 
This may be set forth as follows 

Principle of Equivalence For an indefinitely small region of the world 
(that IS, a region so small that the variation of gravitation in it m both time and 
space is negligible) there exists a coordinate system 5o (Xi, Xi, X 3 , Xi) with respect 
to which gravitation has no influence either upon the motions of mass particles 01 
upon any other physical phenomena whatsoever. 

Such IS the logical basis from which the general theory of relatn ity proceeds 
We can not here follow it in its high enterprise of conquest over the laws of 
nature The road (at present and perhaps for a long time to come) can be fol- 
lowed only by one who is willing to give serious and long-continued attention 
to the study of certain branches of mathematics In the earlier parts of the 
argument the reasoning is rather technical and abstruse in character and the 
general steps are intelligible only to those who ha\ e a considerable acquaintance 
with a certain range of mathematical ideas After a time the exposition conies 
down, if not to earth, at least to the solar system and cases begin to appear in 
which it IS possible to find means for choosing between the theory of Newton 
and that of Einstein. 

Three crucial phenomena have been brought to light by means of which to 
test between the two theories We shall now speak briefly of each of these 

For a long time astronomers have known that there is a certain forward 
advance in the perihelion position of the planet Mercury which can not be 
accounted for on Newton’s theory It amounts to about 42 seconds of angular 
measure per century This is well accounted for by Einstein’s theory 

Einstein predicted, on the basis of his theory, that a ray of light from a 
star which is seen apparently close to the edge of the sun would be found to be 



736 


SUPPLEMENT I 


bent out of a straight path and that the deflection thus caused would turn out 
to be 1 74 seconds of angular measure, the bending being in such a direction 
that the sLai cuuld actually be seen when just behind the edge of the sun. The 
prediction has been verified with a good degree of precision, observations having 
been taken at two eclipses of the sun. 

A third crucial phenomenon is associated with the vibrations of an atom 
in a gravitational field Since the periods of an atom furnish a sort of natural 
clock, it should gi\e an in\ariant measure of an interval of time. Proceeding 
from this hjpothesis one concludes that an atom vibrates more slowly on the 
sun than on the earth, due to the influence of the larger gravitational field of 
the sun Hence the lines of the spectrum should be displaced towards the red 
For the part of the spectrum usually observed this amounts to about .008 
tenth-meters (a tenth-meter = 10~*® meters) For a long time there was grave 
doubt whether this phenomenon is actually existent, but the evidence for its 
existence now (1933) seems to be conclusive 

Moreover in recent years it has come to be recognized that the stars known 
as white dwarfs have masses which are comparable with that of the sun, while 
their radii are much smaller The companion of Sinus is a star whose radius is 
about 1/35 of that of our sun Computation shows that the shift in the lines of 
the spectrum produced by light passing near this star should be about 30 
tenth-meters. This matter was put to the test at Mount Wilson Observatory 
and an actual shift of 32 tenth-meters was found One would conclude then 
that It is now hardly possible to doubt the actual existence of the spectral shift 
predicted by the Einstein theory. 

Whatever may be the final verdict concerning the validity of the theory of 
relativity as a whole, it has certainly made a fundamental and permanent con- 
tribution to astronomy in developing a modification of Newton’s law of gravi- 
tation. It has been checked experimentally in three very different ways and is 
thus established on a rather secure basis. Three such conquests as those just 
recorded have probably never before been made so nearly simultaneously by 
a single theory developed from one point of view consistently maintained 
throughout

THE THEORY OF TYPES^ 
BY Paul Weiss* 


It would seem from the interpretation that Whitehead and Russell put on 
the theory of types, that it is impossible or meaningless to state propositions 
which have an unrestricted possible range of values, or which, in any sense, 
are arguments to themselves. Thus on the acceptance of the principle that 
statements about all propositions are meaningless,* it would be illegitimate to 
say, ‘‘all propositions are representable by symbols,” "all propositions in\oKe 
judgment," ‘‘all propositions are elementary or not elementary,” and if no 
statement could be made about all the members of a set,* it would be impossible 
to say, ‘‘all meanings are limited by a context," “all ideas are ps> chologically 
conditioned,” "all significant assertions ha\e grammatical structures,” etc, 
all of which are intended to apply to themselves as well The theory seems 
also to make ineffective a familiar form of refutation Genrial propositions 
are frequently denied because their enunciation or acknowledgment depends 
on the tacit supposition of the truth of a contradictory or contrary proposition 
Such refutations assume that the general proposition should be capable of 
being an argument of the same t> pe and to the same function as its oi\ n argu- 
ments, so that according to Whitehead and Russell, they fallaciously refute 
"by an argument which involves a \icious circle fallacy” * 

That these limitations on the scope of assertions or on the validity of 
refutations are rarely heeded is apparent even from a cursory examination 
of philosophical writings since 1910 Thus Russell, apropos to Bergson’s 
attempt to state a formula for the comic says,* "it would seem to be impossible 
to find any such formula as W Bergson seeks Every formula tieats what is 
living as if it were mechanical, and is therefore by his own rules a fitting object 
of laughter ” The characterisation of all formula:, even though it refers to a 
totality, seems to Mr Russell to be of the same type as the formulae characterised

SUPPLEMENT II 


If the theory were without any embarrassments of its own, and were 
indispensable for the resolution of the so-called paradoxes* (which no one 
seems to bchc\e), there would be nothing to do but to acknowledge the impos- 
sibility of cosmic formulations, as well as the inadequacy of philosophic 
criticisms, and to pass charitably over such remarks as Russell’s as mere 
accidents in a busy life However, the statement of the theory itself involves 
the following difficulties in connection with (1) its scope, (2) its applicability 
to propositions made about it, and (3) its description 

1 It is either about all propositions or it is not 

A If it were about all propositions it would violate the theory of ij, 
and be meaningless or self-contradictory 

B. If It were not about all propositions, it would not be universa 
applicable To state it, its limitations of application would ha\ e 
be specified One cannot say that there is a different theory of typj® 
for each order of the hierarchy, for the proposition about the his.r- 
archy introduces the difficulty over again. 

2. Propositions about the theory of types (such as the present ones, as 
well as those in the Pnncipta) are subject to the theory of types, or they are not 

A. If they were, the theory would include within its own scope propositions 

of a higher order, and thus be an argument to what is an argument 
to It * 

B. If they were not, there would be an unlimited number of propositions, 

not subject to the theory, that could be made directly or indirectlj 
about It Among these propositions there might be some which 
refer to a totality and involve functions which have arguments 
presupposing the function 

3. The statement of the theory of types is either a proposition or a 
propositional function, neither or both 

A. If It were a proposition, it would be either elementary, first order, 
general, etc , have a definite place in a hierarchy and refer only to 
those propositions which are of a lower order If it were held to be 
a proposition of the last order, then the number of orders would 
have a last term, and there could not be meaningful propositions 
made about the theory The Principia should not be able to say, 
on that basis, just what the purpose, character and application ot 
the theory is 

B Similarly, if it were a propositional function, it would have a definite 
place in a hierarchy, being derived from a proposition by generalisa- 

‘ Paradoxes, though contrary to common opinion, may be and frequently are

ingless. are false, and it is only they which are capable of logical analysis and 
resolution What the Pnnctpta attempts to do is to solve apparent paranoumena 
with a real paranoumenon

tion. It could not refer to all propositions or propositional functions, 
but only to those of a lower order 

C If It were neither it could not be true or false, nor refer to anything 
that was true or false It could not apply to propositions, for only 
propositions or propositional functions, in a logic, refer to propositions 
D If both at once, it would be necessarily self-relle\ive 

a If as function it had itself as value, it would refer to itself But 
the theory of types denies that a function can have itself as value 
h If as function it had something else as value, it would conform 
to the theory, which insists that functions have something else 
as values The theory then applies to itself and is self-refle\i\ e, 
and thus does not apply to itself As, by hypothesis, it is a value 
' of some other function, there must be propositions of a higher 

order and w'lder range than the theory of types 
It is no wonder that the perpetralois of the theory have not been altogether 
liappy about it' What is sound in it — and there is much that is — is best 
discovered by forgetting their statements altogether, and by endeavouring to 
analyse the problems it was designed to answer, without recourse to their 
machinery The result will be an acknowledgment of a theory of types having 
a limited application, and a formulation of a principle which will permit certain 
kinds of unrestricted general propositions 

To do this we shall deal in detail with two apparent paranoumena dealt 
with in the Pnnctpta, where the difficulty is largely methodologtcal We shall 
then treat of Weyl’s “heterological-autological” problem, where the difficulty 
IS due to a confusion in meanings Those problems which cannot be dealt with 
under either heading will be those which need a theory of types for their 
resolution 

1 Epimemdes The proposition "All Cretans are liars" must be false if it 
applies to Epimemdes as well, for it cannot be true, and only as false has it 
meaning If it were true, it w'ould involve its own falsit> . When taken as false, 
no contradiction, or even paradox, is involved, for the truth W'ould then be 
“some Cretans tell the truth" (The truth could not be "all Cretans tell the 
truth" for Epimemdes must be a liar for that to be true and by that token it 
must be false). Epimemdes himself would be one of the lying Cretans, and one 
of the lies that the Cretans were wont to make would be “all Cretans are liars". 
Thus if Epimemdes meant to include all his own remarks within the scope 
of the assertion, he would contradict himself or state a falsehood If it be 
denied that a contradictory assertion can have meaning, he must be saying 
something false if he is saying anything significant Had he meant to refer to 
all other Cretans there is, of course, no difficulty, for he then invokes a kind 
of theory of types by which he makes a remark not intended to apply to himself 
All difficulty disappears when it is recognised that the formal implication, “all 
Cretanic statements are lies" can as a particular statement be taken as one of 
the values of the terms of this implication LettingEp / prepresent “Epimemdes 
once asserted p", if> represent "Cretanic” and p represent a statement or

proposition, then for "All Cretanic statements are false (or lies),’’ we ha\« 

1 <l>p ^ j, p 

And as Epimenides is a Cretan, for any assertion he makes we have 

2 Ep ' p ^ p <pp 

As No 1 IS an argument to the above — it being Epimenides’ present remark 
we get 

i Ep' [4>p ^ p p\ = . ^ p '^P\ 

No 1, as a Cretanic statement, is an argument to No 1 as a formal implication 
or principle about Cretanic statements, so that 

3A <p[<pp ^ p'^ p\ ^ {<I>P ^ p P\ 

No 3 and No 3A by the syllogism yield 

3B Ep' {4>p = p ^ ^1 • => '^[<PP ^ P ^ P\ 
so that in this instance Epimenides lied 

It IS important to note that No 1 states a formal implication, and that 
No 3, No 3A and No 3B employ No 1 as a particular assertion or specific 
argument to their functions No 3A is an instance of the implication expressed 
by No 1, and is this instance because of the particular argument it does have 
It states the fact that " ‘all Cretanic statements are false’ is a Cretanic State- 
ment,’’ implies that “ ‘all Cretanic statements are false’ is false” Substitution 
of another argument would give a different instance, though of course of the 
same implication The implication contained in its argument does not have 
instances “ ‘Some Cretanic statements are false’ is a Cretanic statement” 
or " ‘This Cretanic statement is false’ is a Cretanic statement” are not 
instances of “ ‘All Cretanic statements are false’ is a Cretanic statement,” 
but of “P is a Cretanic statement” These three propositions have different 
subjects, they are different values of the same propositional function That 
these subjects have relations to one another is of no moment "My wife loves 
me” and “my mother-in-law is old (or loves me)” are two distinct and logically 
independent propositions, even though there is a relationship between the 
two subjects 

It IS because any considered general proposition is at once an individual 
fact, and a formal implication or principle, with many possible arguments, that 
it is capable of being taken as an argument to itself All propositions about 
words, logic, truth, meaning, ideas, etc , take arguments which fall in these 
same categories, and in so far as such a general proposition is stated m words, 
determined by logic, etc , it should, as such a fact, be an argument to itself 
as a formal implication The principle must be false if this cannot be done, 
for It IS sufficient, in order to overthrow a proposition of this kind, to produce 
one argument for which it does not hold One may limit the principle by 
asserting that it holds for "all but ”, in which case it is a restricted general 
proposition Nominalism, association of ideas, scepticism, the theory of universal 
tautology, the denial of logic are defended in propositions which cannot take 
themselves as arguments, and which as facts are arguments to contradictory 
principles. Their contradictory principles therefore hold sometimes at least. 



THE THEORY OF TYPES 


741 


that these doctrines must be false if they are put forward without restriction, 
and cannot be universally true, if, in Bradley's words, they “appear”. 

2 “I am 1> mg” — if it be taken in isolation from all fact — is a meaningless 
statement. There must be some objective truth that is distorted, and unless 
It IS pro\ ided the assertion has no significance. This proposition means either, 
"I am lying about X”, “I always lie,” or “I have always lied”. The first 
can be either true or false without giving rise to any problem, except where 
“all my assertions” is made an argument to X, in which case it is equi\alent 
to either the second or third formulation “I always he” in\ol\es the same 
situation as with Epimenides, and the proposition is false The supposition 
of its truth would involve a contradiction; the supposition of its falsity means 
simply that I sometimes he and sometimes tell the truth If what is meant is 
that "I have alway's lied” that does not involve a contradiction, for what is 
intended is a restricted proposition, applying to all but the present one It can 
be true because it does not apply to all propositions, if it were false, then some- 
times I lied and sometimes I did not In short, there is nothing like a self- 
reflective universal liar, which is an interesting moral conclusion to derive 
from a logical analysis Similarly', there cannot be a thorough scepticism held 
by the sceptic to be valid 

Prof Wliitehead (to whom I am also indebted for the notation) has pointed 
out to me that wherever a conjunction of propositions results in a reducho 
ad absurdnm, there is no way of determining on logical grounds alone which 
of the antecedents fails, or is false (though one at least must be) Thus in the 
case of Epimenides we have 

4 \<tip {Ep ' P <t>p\ Ep'[<pp => p '^p\ 

(A) (B) (C) 

=3 {0/> ^ p P\ 

(D) 

It IS because B and C are in that case assumed to hold, that we can say 
that A must fail If the truth of all these antecedents were undetermined, we 
should have merely the general rule a rcdiiclio ad absurdnm has as a necessary 
condition the conjunction of one or more false piopositions Transposition — 

4'. {0/>.^p '^#>1 ^ ^ p #>1 

(D) (A) 

V ^ [Ep < p ^ p <l)p] .'v.'^Ep ' [<t)p ^ p p] 

(B) (C) 

makes it apparent that to deny the conclusion of a reductio ad absurdnm is to 
imply that at least one of the antecedents is false 

In connection with the reductio ad absurdnm involved in the assertions, 
“I always he” and “I always doubt,” No 4B reduces to the tautologies “If I 
assert p, p is my assertion, ’ and "If I doubt, the doubt is mine” In these 
cases, the only alternatives left are the denial of the fact of the assertion (No. 
4C), or the truth of the principle itself (No 4A).

SUPPLEMENT II 


3 Weyl’s heterological-autologicalcontradiction^ is the result of a material 
fallacy of amphiboly in connection with the employment of adjectives. The 
simplest form of such a fallacy is due to a failure to distuiguibli between an 
adjective as substanti\e and an adjective as attribute Thus if we treat both 
the subject and attribute in "large is small” and "small is large” as attributes 
united by a copula expressing identity (instead of reading it as "large is a small 
word,” "small is a large word”) we could say "whateier is small is large, and 
whatever is large is small” No one, I believe, since the Megarics, has been 
troubled by this particular confusion 

The present problem is the result of a confusion, jiot between substantiv e 
and adjective, but between an adjective which expresses a property, and an 
adjective which expresses a relation between this property and the substantive. 
All words can be described in terms of a property — they are long, short, beau- 
tiful, melodious, etc , words They can be classified in accordance with these 
properties, giving us the class of long words, short words, etc They can also 
be classified as either "aulological” or "heterological,” depending on whether 
or not the same word is at once substantive ancb^ropcrty-adjective, the terms 
'autological” and “heterological” expressing relationships between the sub- 
stantive and adjective 

The autological class is made up of words, each of which expresses a property 
which It possesses: though all of them have unique properties If “short” be 
short, and if "melodious” be melodious, they would both be members of the 
autological class, though m addition, “short” vv'ould be a member of the class 
of short words, and “melodious” would be a member of the class of melodious 
words 

The heterological class is made up of words, each of which expresses a 
property which it does not possess If “long” be short, and if “fat” be thin, 
they would both be members of the heterological class, although here also 
"long” would be a member of the class of short words, and “fat” would be a 
member of the class of thin words Though when classified according to the 
relationship of the adjective to the substantive, "short" would be an autological 
word and “long” a heterological word, they would both be members of that 
class which was defined in terms of the properties of words — being in this 
case, members of the class of short words 

Now if heterologicality were a property that a word could have, and if the 
word “heterological” had that property, it would be a member of the auto- 
logical class, for it would then possess a property-- that it expressed But it would 
also be a member of a class of words which had the property of heterologicality 
This class IS determined by taking the properties of words, and if it be called 

‘Briefly stated it is all words which express a property they possess are 
autological, all words which express a property they do not possess are hetero- 
logical If ‘heterological’ is heterological it expresses a property it possesses and 
is thus autological , if it is autological, it expresses a property it does not possess 
and IS therefore heterological. Das Kontmuum, p 2 



THE THEORY OF TYPES 


743 


"heterological,” must be distinguished from that class which was determined 
not by properties, but by the relationship between properties and substantives 

If there were a property like autologicality and if "heterological” had that 
property,* it viould be a member of the heterological class, for it would express 
a property which it did not possess But it would also be a member of the class 
of words which possessed autologicality and could thus be classified 

Thus if "heterological" had the property of autologicality, it would be in 
the heterological class owing to the relation which held between the property 
and substanti\e (or between a property it possessed and the property it ex- 
pressed) , but It would be in the class of autological words, owing to a property 
it possessed If it had the property of heterologicality, it would be m the auto- 
logical class on the basis of the relation, and in the class of heterological words 
on the basis of property classification There is no difficulty in considering some- 
thing as a member of two distinct classes, owing to the employment of different 
methods of classification There is no contradiction in saying “ ‘heterological’ 
expresses the property heterologicality, possesses the property autologicality, 
and the relation between these properties is heterological, or that it expresses 
and possesses the property heterologicality and the relation between them is 
autological " Similarly, Richard's contradiction. Berry’s contradiction, and 
that involving the least indefinable ordinal, are resoh able by recognising that 
"nameable” and “indefinable” are used in two sharply distinguishable senses 
They do not require a hierarchy, but a discrimination in the methods of 
description 

When a distinction is made between a class and its membership (the dis- 
tinction between a number of numbers and a number is a particular case of 
this), and between a relation of objects and a relation of relations, the require- 
ments for the solution of the other mathematical problems aie proMded A 
class IS other than its members, and a relation, like all universals, transcends 
any given instance or totality of instances As they ha\e characters of their 
own, universals can be described in terms of other uni\ crsals, which in turn 
transcend them Arguments are of a dillerent “t>pc” than functions, just so 
far as they have different logical characteristics, i c are different kinds of logical 
facts. The class which is an aigumcnt to a function about classes has, as argu- 
ment, a different logical import than the function, and its aiguments ha\e a 
different import from it This is true of all functions, restricted and unrestricted 
alike, for it means simply that they are discrimmable from their arguments 
They can, despite this difference, have characteristics in common with their 
arguments, and are to that extent unrestricted Thus in the case of "the class 
of those classes which are identical with themselves,” the class of classes can be 

‘ ‘Heterological,’ in tact, has the properties of being long, polysyllabic, etc , 
and It IS questionable whether there are properties like autologicality and hetero- 
logicality possessed by words If there be no such properties, ‘‘heterological’ is a 
member of the class of long words, polysyllabic words, etc In addition it would 
be one of the terms related by the heterological relation, which fact would not 
make it have the property of heterologicality

taken simply as a class, without logical embarrassment Yet a class of classes 
differs from a class, and must therefore be capable of a different characterisation, 
and thus also be an argumeii L Lo a function of a different type With some classes, 
it may not be possible to consider them as arguments to their own functions, 
without uncovering a contradiction In such cases (e g the class of those classes 
which are not members of themselves, and the relations which are connected 
by their contradictories), it is the difference between the function and the 
argument that is of moment That some functions cannot take themselves as 
arguments does not indicate that all functions are restricted in scope, but 
simply that they are non-reslnctei Some classes and functions are restricted 
and some are not To say that all are restricted because some are is an obvious 
fallacy 

Whenever, as individual, a general proposition is in the class of those ob- 
jects of which It treats, but cannot be considered as an argument to itself, it is 
either false or restricted in scope If the second, its range of arguments must be 
specified Accordingly, we can state as a necessary condition for the truth of a 
general proposition, whose scope is unspecified, that when it has a character, 
which is one of the characters about which it speaks, it must be an argument 
to Itself Thus if Bergson adequately described the comic, his formula should 
be an object of laughter, and if the theory of types is universal in application, 
It should be capable of being subject to itself Conformity to this condition in- 
dicates that the unrestneted proposition is possibly true, not that it is neces- 
sarily true To demonstrate that such a propiosition was necessarily true, it 
would be essential to show that the supposition of its falsity assumes its truth. 
That there is danger in applying this rule can be seen from the consideration 
of some such proposition as “Everything is made up of language elements”. 
Its denial will be made up of language elements, and would seem to demonstrate 
that the proposition was necessarily true Supposition of the falsity of a propo- 
sition, however, means verbal denial only in so far as the proposition applies to 
the realm of language If it applies to everything, supposition of its falsity 
involves the positing of the objects of assertions, not the assertions A neces- 
sary unrestricted proposition about everything can be supported only by a 
demonstration that the supposition of an argument for which it does not hold 
IS self-contradictory If the proposition has to do with grammar, meaning, 
logic, judgment, etc , the conditions for a necessarily true and unrestricted 
proposition would be 1 the assertion of it is an argument to it, 2 any possible 
denial is an argument to it That "any possible denial” rather than “any given 
denial" is required, is apparent from the consideration of the following proposi- 
tions “All sentences are made up of eight words," "No sentence is made up of 
eight words". Each of these contains eight words It is because of the fact 
that we can formulate propositions such as, “It is false that every proposition 
must be made up of eight words,” that the condition is seen not to have been met 

An unrestricted proposition applies to e\ery member of the category, and 
has some aspect of itself as value. It is in some sense then a determinate in the 
category which it determines. If the proposition refers to some other category 



THE THEORY OF TYPES 


745 


than the one to which it as fact, or some aspect of it as fact, belongs, it is re- 
stricted Thus “all men are mortal" is neither man nor mortal, and as condition 
does not determine itself as fact. Any proposition referring to that statement 
would be of a different tj pe, and would deal with its truth, falsi tj', constituents, 
historical place, logical structure, etc Though the unrestricted propositions 
have no limitations, the category to which they refer may ha^ e Epimenides’ 
remark, for example, referred only to Cretans As his assertion was a deter- 
minate in the category, and as his statement of the supposed conditions imposed 
on the members of that category was not a possible argument to the general 
proposition, the general proposition was seen to be false or restricted Had he 
said, “All Cretans tell the truth,” he would haxe stated an unrestricted propo- 
sition which was possibly true It could not be said to be necessarily true unless 
Cretans and lie, against the evidence of histor>-, were actually contradictories 

Accordingly, we shall say All true ttnrcsli icted propositions are arguments 
to themselves, or by transposition, those propositions lohich are not arguments to 
themselves are either restricted or false As this proposition can take itself as 
argument it is possibly true Unless no proposition is possible w'hich does not 
conform to it, it cannot be said to be necessarily true I ha\ e not been able to 
demonstrate this and therefore accept it as a definition or “methodological 
pnnciple of validation" The theory of types, in its most general form, may be 
stated as A proposition or function of order n, which cannot be an argument to 
itself, IS, as fact, an argument of a proposition or function of order n+l 

In accordance with the scheme of the criticism of the theory of types, v\e 
can describe our principle as (1) appljing to all propositions, including (2) those 
which refer to it (3) It is a formal implication with itself as one of its argu- 
ments The theory of t) pes, on the other hand, (1) does not apply to all propo- 
sitions, but only to those which are restricted, (2) may apjily to those proposi- 
tions which refer to it, and (3) is a foimal implication which cannot take itself 
as argument 

The theorj' of types cannot be an unrestricted proposition about all re- 
stneted propositions As an unrestricted proposition it must take itself as 
argument, but its arguments are only those propositions wdneh are not argu- 
ments to themselves It cannot therefore be unrestricted w'lihout being re- 
stricted Nor can it be a restricted proposition about all restricted propositions 
for It would then be one of the lestricted propositions, and ivould ha\e to take 
Itself as argument — in which case it would be unrestricted Hence it cannot 
be restricted without being unrestricted Three possible solutions may be ad- 
vanced The first is that the theory of ty'pes is restricted and does not apply 
to all restricted propositions, but only to some of them It is not an argument 
to Itself but to some other proposition about restricted propositions 'J'his in 
turn wdl have to be restricted and refer only to some propositions, and so on, 
giving us theories of types of carious orders The proposition made about the 
totality of these orders would be of a still higher order and would in turn pre- 
suppose a higher order ad infinitum The theory of types thus depends on 
theories of types of theories of types without end This seems probable on the

ground that the theory is based on the recognition that no proposition can be 
made about all restricted propositions, so that it must by that very fact admit 
that It cannot apply to all ot them Instead, therefore, of the theory of types 
applying to all propositions, and determining them in various orders, it does not 
even apply to all of a given class of them. This interpretation would not affect 
unrestricted propositions, and would merely show that the determination of 
restricted propositions is subject to determinations without end 

The second possibility is suggested by the consideration of a proposition 
such as “all truths are but partially true” If that were absolutely true, it 
would contradict itself, and if it were not, could apply only to some truths 
Considered as referring to the necessary limitations which any finite statement 
must hai e, it would take itself as argument in so far as it was finite, thus indi- 
cating that it was absolutely true about finite propositions, and yet not abso- 
lutely true as regards all truths By pointing out the limitations of a finite 
statement it indicates that there is an absolute truth in terms of which it is 
relatively true On this interpretation, any condition which imposes universal 
limitations is unlimited m teims of what it limits, but limited in turn by some 
other condition One might hold, therefore, that the theory would be unre- 
stricted as regards restricted propositions, and restricted as regards all propo- 
sitions, and would point to a higher pnnciple which limits it 

The third possibility is to allow for "intensive’’ propositions which are 
neither restricted nor unrestricted, being incapable of any arguments. The 
theory of types could be viewed as such an intensive proposition, and what we 
have called its arguments, would meiely “conform” to it This interpretation 
means the downfall of a completely evtensional logic, and a determination of an 
extensional logic as subordinate to an intensional one 

There are difficulties in each of these interpretations The last seems to me 
to be best. In any of these cases, however, a restricted proposition which refers 
to some other than the restricted aspect of the theory would be subject to the 
theory and the principle wt have laid down about unrestricted propositions 
could still hold Those restricted propositions which refer to the restricted 
character of the theory would not be an argument to it on the first, would be 
an argument to it on the second, and would neither be nor not be an argument 
to it on the third solution 

To briefly summarise The theory of types must be limited m application 
Not all the problems it was designed to answer require it, another principle of 
greater logical import is desirable, while for the resolutioji of the problems in 
which it IS Itself involved, very drastic remedies are necessary. No matter how 
the theory fares, the possibility of the methodological principle and the pos- 
sibility of other solutions for the so-called paradoxes, indicate that it is at least 
not as significant an instrument as it was originally thought to be. .

A NON-ARISTOTELIAN SYSTEM AND ITS NECESSITY FOR 
RIGOUR IN MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS* 

BY Alfred Korzybski 


We are here dealing with a concrete mathematical problem which is not 
trivial, but at the same time is solvable, and I cannot imagine that any 
mathematician can find the courage to elude its honest solution by means 
of a metaphysical dogma (S49) herm vn'n weyl 

I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, 
which m mathematics is never permissible Infinity is merely a /afo» de 
parler, the real meaning being a limit which certain ratios approach in- 
definitely near, while'others are permitted to increase without restrictions 

(74) K F GAU'ib 


A very extensive literature shows that the problems of 'infinity' pervade 
human psycho-logical reactions, starting from the lowest stage of human de- 
velopment up to the present and that without some theory of ‘infinity’, modern 
mathematics would be impossible Up to date, no satisfactory theory of in- 
finity, on which all mathematicians could agree, has been produced The results 
are rather bewildering because what appears to some prominent mathematicians 
as perfectly sound mathematics is evaluated by other equally prominent scien- 
tists as a ‘mental’ disease (Poincare), or we find opinions that a large portion 
of mathematics is devoid of proof and has to be accepted on faith , or that some 
parts of mathematics must be treated as non-sense (Kronecker, Brouwer, 
Weyl . ,). ‘There are eminent scholars on both sides and the chance of reaching 
an agreement within a finite period is practically excluded’, says Brouwer, and 
certainly such a state of affairs docs not allow us to hai e any satisfactory modern 
standards of prcxjf and rigour, the last thing we should expect in mathematics 

The majority of those mathematicians who take interest in the soundness 
of their science seem to believe that the main difficulty centres around the 
validity of the ‘law of excluded third’ (‘A is B, or not B') of the accepted, sharply 
two-valued, chrisippian form of A ‘logic’ They disregard the fact that we are 
bom, bred, educated, speak a language, live under conditions, institutions , 
which still remain desperately A or even pre-arislotelian If we attempt to re- 
ject one of the two-valued ‘laws of thought’ or postulates of the ^-system, but 
retain A or pre-aristotelian elementahstic ‘psychologies', ‘logic’, and j r, no 
agreement in ‘a finite period’ can be expected, and the present mathematical 
chaos would continue

Among the more important schools we may distinguish roughly^ 

1) The logistic school represented by Peano, Russell, and Whitehead, who 
accept the chrisippian, two-^ alued, restricted form of the el ‘logic’ and so may 
be called the chnsippian school 

2) The aMomatic school, represented by Hilbert and his followers, which 
may be called the aristolehan school 

3) The ‘intuitional’ school represented by Brouwer and Weyl who question 
the ‘law of excluded third’, and so may be called the non-christpptan school 

4) The Polish school of (a) ’intuitional’ formalism with Lukasiewiczi 
Tarski, Lesniewski as representatives, which may be called the non-aristoielian 
school Lukasiewicz generalized the A. ‘logic’ to three-valued ‘logic’ which 
co\ers modality Lukasiewicz and Tarski finally produced a general many- 
\ alued ‘logic’ of which the tvi o-valued represents only a limiting case. Lesniewski 
produced Prototheke, a still more general ‘logical’ system, by introducing variable 
‘funktors’, * (b) The restricted semantic school represented by Chwistek and 
his pupils, which IS characterized mostly by the semantic approach, and by 
pay mg special attention to the number of values, establishing the thesis that 
the older 'freedom from contradictions’ depends on one-valued formulations, as 
discovered by Skarzenski and quoted by Chwistek This school has already 
produced new foundations (still elementalistic) for ‘logic’ and mathematics, and 
leads to generalized arithmetics and analysis 

5) The average prevalent mathematical technician, who does not realize 
that he belongs to the numerically large class which may be called the ‘christian 
science’ school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely 
any problems of the epistemological foundations of their supposed ’scientific’ 
activities 

It should be noticed that all existing mathematical schools accept implicitly, 
at least, A elementahsm and do not challenge identity, a principle which happens 
to be invariably false to facts and which therefore should be entirely abolished 

The above classification suggests that, in spite of great achievements in 
the field of mathematical foundations, no school can expect to be convincing 
or accepted by other schools as long as we all flounder in the A and el ambigu- 
ities which prevent any possibility of agreement It becomes obvious also that 
w'hen a A and non-el system is formulated it will necessitate a new paradox-free 
foundation for mathematics and so a new school of mathematics will arise which 
may be called 

6) The general semantic, non-aristotehan , non-elementahstic school of mathe- 
matics It is premature to give the names of the leading pioneers in this field 
at present 

*At present Lukasiewicz and Tarski call their many-valued ‘logic’ non- 
chrisippian, but this name does not seem appropriate because these authors general- 
ized both forms of the aristoteliaii ‘logic’ to a many-valued ‘logic’ of which the 
two-valued becomes only a limiting case Thus it seems that their many-valued 
‘logic’ is better described by the term non-anstotelian, yet still elementalistic ‘logic’ 



A PHYSICO-MATHEMATICAL RIGOUR 


749 


In a -system, the ‘logical’ problems of freedom from contiadiction become 
also semantic problems of one-valued meanings made possible only undei oo- 
valued, A , non-el general semantics, and the recognition of the A multiordinahty 
of terms , . A ^-system introduces some fundamental innovations, such as com- 
pletely rejectirg identity, elemcntalism , and becomes based on m o structure 
and order, ard so ultimately becomes non-el The A, (3-t-l)-dimensional el, 
(m the mam) tnlenstonal system becomes a four-dimensional, non-el, (in the 
mam) exlenstonal system In such a sjstem we cannot use the formulations of 
elementahstic ‘logics’ and 'psychologies', but must have A, non-el general 
setnanhes, which when generalized become an entirely general discipline ap- 
plicable to all life, as well as to generalized mathematics For the abo\ e reasons 
I shall use the word ‘logic’, m its el sense, with quotation marks, and use the 
term general semantics for a non-el, A discipline corresponding to the el, A 
or A ‘logics’. 

Investigations show that the primitive man (and the ‘mentally’ ill) use 
one-valued semantics which hat e left more or less marked traces in all of us, 
reflected even in science and mathematics The elimination of these primitive 
traces clears the foundation for an adult ci\ ilization, a theory of sanity, and the 
elimination of the scientific and mathematical paradoxes 

To assume that because a many-valued ‘logic’ has been produced, all the 
problems of mathematical infinity, irrational numbers, continuity , mathematical 
induction, validity of mathematical proof, mathematical existence , ha\’e been 
solved, would be a mistake The aim of the present paper is to analy se some of 
the fundamental complexities produced by the unconscious operation of the 
one-valued semantic identification concealed in the formulation of the ‘law of 
identity’, which have escaped notice until now, and which would make the 
application of a many-valued ‘logic’ or oo-valued semantics and agreement 
impossible Here, as in the E and N sy^stems, only the most general formula- 
tions help us to discriminate between the particular cases, and so to eliminate 
the undesirable traces of one-^alucd semantics by building a ^-system, of 
which the A and pre-^ represent only particular cases 

Let me recall the ‘philosophical grammar’ of our language which w'e 
solemnly call the ‘law's of thought', as gnen by Je\ons ^ 

1) The law of identity ^^'hate^er is, is 

2) The law of contradiction Nothing can both be, and not be 

3) The law of excluded third Everything must either be, or not be 

These ‘laws’ ha\ e different ’philosophical’ interpretations which help very 

little and for my purpose it is enough to emphasize that (1) The second ‘law’ 
represents a negative statement of the first, and the third represents a corollary 
of the former two, namely, no third piossible between two contradictories. 
(2) The verb ‘to be', or ‘is’, and 'identity' play a most fundamental role in 
these formulations We should not be surprised to find that the ini estigation 
of these terms may give us a long sought solution Such an investigation is 
very laborious and difficult ‘The complete attempt to deal with the term ts 
would go to the form and matter of everything in existence, at least, if not to

the possible form and matter of all that does not exist, but might As far as 
it could be done, it would git c the grand Cyclopaedia, and its yearly supplement 
would be the histoiy of the human race for the time', said Augustus de Morgan 
in his Formal Logic, and this opinion I found fully justified 

So I must be brief, and state but roughly, that in the Indo-european 
languages the terb ‘to be' has at least four entirelj different uses. (1) as an 
auxiliary verb, ‘Smith is coming', (2) as the 'is' of predication, ‘the apple is 
red', (3) as the ‘is' of 'existence', ‘I am', (4) as the ‘is’ of identity, ‘the apple 
IS a fruit' The fact that four semantically entirely different words should 
have one sound and spelling appears as a genuine tragedy of the race, the 
more so since the discrimination between their uses is not always easy. 

The researches of the present writer have shown that the problems involved 
are very complicated and cannot be solx ed except by a joint study of mathe- 
matics, mathematical foundations, history of mathematics, ‘logic’, ‘psyxholog^', 
anthropology, psj chiatry , linguistics, epistemology, phy'sics and its history, 
colloidal chemistry , physiology, and neurology-, this study resulting in the 
discovery of a general semantic mechanism underlying human behaviour, 
many new inteirelauans and formulations, culminating in a -system. This 
semantic mechanism appears as a general psy chophysiological mechanism based 
on four-dimensional order, present and abused in all of us, the primitive man, 
the infant, the ‘mentally' ill, and the genius not excluded It gives us an ex- 
tremely simple means of training our s r, which can be applied even in elementary 


education

If we consider an actual territory (o) say. Pans, Dresden, Warsaw, and 
build up a map (6) in which the order of these cities would be represented as 
Dresden, Pans, Warsaw, to tra\ el by- such a map w ould be misguiding, wasteful 
of effort , In case of emergencies, it might be seriously harmful , . We could 
say that such a map was ‘not true' , or that the map had a structure not similar 
to the territory, structure to be defined in terms of relations and multi- 
dimensional order We should notice that 

A) A map may have a structure similar or dissimilar to the structure 

of the territory (1) 

B) Two similar structures have similar 'logical' characteristics Thus, if 

in a correct map, Dresden is given as between Pans and Warsaw, a similar 
relation is found in the actual terntory. (2) 

C) A map IS not the territory. (3) 



A PHYSICO-MATHEMATICAL RIGOUR 


751 


D) An ideal map would contain the map of the map, the map of the map 
of the map . , endlessly This charactenstic was first discovered by Royce 
We may call it self-reflexiveness (4) 

Languages share with the map the above four characteristics. 

A) Languages have structure, thus we may have languages of elementahshc 

structure such as ‘space’ and ‘time’, ‘observer’ and ‘observed’, ‘body’ and ‘soul’, 
‘senses’ and ‘mind’, ‘intellect’ and ‘emotions’, ‘thinking’ and ’feeling’, ‘thought’ 
and ‘intuition’ , which allow verbal division or separation Or we may ha\e 
languages of non-elemenlahsttc structure such as, ‘space-time’, the new quantum 
languages, ‘time-bmdmg’, ‘different order abstractions’, ‘semantic reactions’ , 
which do not involve verbal division or separation , also mathematical 
languages of ‘order’, ‘relation’, ‘structure’, ‘function’, ‘\ariable’, ‘invariant’, 
‘difference’, ‘addition’, ‘division’ , which apply to ‘senses’ and ‘mind’, that is, 
can be ‘seen’ and ‘thought of’, (5) 

B) If we use languages of a structure non-similar to the world and our 

nervous system, our verbal predictions are not verified empirically, m e cannot 
be ‘rational’ or adjusted , , We would have to copy the animals m their wasteful 
and painful ‘trial and error’ performances, as we ha\e done all through human 
history In science we would be handicapped by semantic blockages, lack of 
creativeness, lack of understanding, lack of Msion, disturbed by inconsistencies, 
paradoxes , (6) 

C) Words are not the things they represent. (7) 

D) Language also has self-reflexive characteristics We use language to 

speak about language, which fact introduces serious verbal and semantic 
difficulties, solved by the theory of multiordinahty (8) 

The above unusually simple considerations lead to unexpectedly far- 
reaching consequences, 

A) From (7) — it follows that the objective levels which include the events, 

ordinary objects, objective actions, processes, immediate feelings, ‘instincts’, 
‘ideas’, j r in general . , represent un-speakable levels, are not words (9) 

B) From (9) — that the use of the ‘is’ of identity, as applied to objective, 
un-speakable levels, appears invariably structurally false to facts and must be 
entirely abandoned. Whatever we might say a happening ’is’, it is not (10) 

C) From (10) — structure appears as the only possible link between the 

obj'ective, un-speakable, and the verbal levels (11) 

D) From (11) — the only possible ‘content of knowledge’ becomes 

exclusively structural (12) 

E) From (12) — the only aim of ‘knowledge’ and science appears as the 

empincal search for, and verbal formulation of, structure. (13) 

F) The only method for acquiring ‘knowledge’ is found in an empirical 
investigation of the potentially unknown structure of the world, ourselves 
included, only afterwards adjusting the structure of languages so that they 
would be similar, and so of maximum usefulness, instead of the delusional 



752 


SUPPLEMENT III 


reversed order of ascnbing to the world the structure of an inherited primitive 
language (14) 

G) The investigation of the potentially known structure of languages in 
which we predict and then verify the predictions empirically, appears as an 
important method for the discovery of the structure of the world. (IS) 

H) Investigations disclose that all A, el languages and disciplines built 

on them (older ‘psychologies’, ‘logics’ , and, based on them, economics, 
sociology, politics, ‘ethics’ , reflected in turn in our institutions, systems , ) 
are not structurally similar to the world and our nervous system, as they 
verbally divide what empirically cannot be divided Under such conditions 
neither a higher grade civilization, nor general sanity, nor paradox-free science 
and mathematics are possible In el languages, our verbal predictions are not 
verified empirically, and not being able to foresee we must proceed by animal- 
istic ‘trial and error’. (16) 

I) Mathematics appears as a very limited but the only language in 

existence, in the main similar in structure to the world around us and the 
nervous sjstem (17) 

J) From the study of mathematics, mathematical physics, and physics, 

we learn, and will continue to leatn, the fundamentals of m o structure It is 
no mystery that all chemistry has become a branch of physics, all physics can 
be made a branch of geometry , all geometry a part of analysis, and all analj sis 
a part of general semantics The present work shows that the analysis of all 
human problems of daily life or science becomes dependent on general semanhes 
which on the verbal levels becomes generalized mathematics Thus mathe- 
matics, mathematical physics, and physics become the most important 
disciplines from which we learn most about structure, — tlie only ‘content of 
knowledge’ (18) 

K) The older el ‘psychologies’ and ‘logics’ for their maximum usefulness 

must be transformed into unified non-el psycho-logics and general semantics, 
possible only after studying all forms of human behaviour, mathematics 
included (19) 

L) The study of mathematics as a form of human behaviour, appears 
necessary prior to the possibility of formulating any laws of semantics (20) 

M) The problem of mathematical foundations do not belong to mathe- 

matics but to psycho-logics which would not disregard anthropology, and 
would not be vitiated by our persistence in the use of structurally inappropriate 
el 'psj chologies’, ‘logics’, and an innocence of mathematics (21) 

N) The ‘intuitional’ and the ‘intuitional’ formalist schools of mathematics 

must be considered as a legitimate, yet not properly formulated, protest 
against the older elementalism (22) 

O) The general semantic school will represent the non-el and A school 

of mathematics (23) 

P) The present crisis of mathematics ultimately depends on the meanings 
and use of a few terms such as ‘all’, ‘there is’, ‘infinite’ , which solution depends 
on a non-el theory of meanings, which ultimately can be solved by transforming

what might be called the (3 + l)-dimensionaI el, ^-s>stem, \\hich divides 
'space' and ‘time' , (an attitude which is carried all through the system), 
into a four-dimensional non-el, ^-system (an attitude which is also carried all 
through the system) (24) 

Q) From (8) — it follows that statements about statements represent 

results of new neurological processes, that their content varies, and that we 
must discnrmnate and not identify these different meanings In other words, 
only through consciousness of abstracting which represents the most general 
s r of discrimination, or the elimination of identification, can we assign single 
values to words which ha\ e an essentiallj manj alued character Identification 
confuses these many meanings into one (25) 

R) We must differentiate between descnpti\e and inferential words and 

phrases, and never use inferential terms as descriptive, without realizing that 
we are doing so (26) 

S) Certain words or phrases used to speak about languages, such as ‘all 
statements', ‘proposition about all propositions’ , lead to self-contradictions 
We cannot speak about ‘all’ propositions without some limitations, if w'e 
proceed introducing new propositions Even St Paul felt the necessity for 
limiting the values of ‘all’ * \^’e are compelled to introduce some equivalents 
to the biblical ‘illegitimate totalities’ or the theorj of tjpes of Russell (27) 

T) Analysis finds that certain of the most important terms v\e use, such 

as, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘true’, ‘false', 'all', ‘fact’, ‘rcalil>’, ‘evistence’, ‘definition’, ‘rela- 
tion’, ‘structure’, ‘order', ‘number’, ‘is’, ‘has’, ‘there is’, ‘variable’, ‘infinite’, 
‘abstraction’, ‘property’, ‘meaning’, ‘value’, ‘love’, ‘hate’, ‘knowing’, ‘doubt’ , , 

may apply to all verbal levels and in each particular case may have a different 
content or meanings and so in general no single content or meaning I call such 
terms multiordinal terms {m o) The definition of such terms is alway s giv cn 
in other m o terms preserving their fundamental multiordinality la other 
words, a. m 0 term represents a many-valued term If the many values are 
identified, or disregarded, or confused, we treat a fundamentally niany'-\ alued 
term as one- valued, and we must have every kind of paradox through sucli an 
identification All known paradoxes in mathematics and life can be manu- 
factured by the disregard of this fundamental multiordinality Vice v ersa, by' 
formulating the general semantic problem of multiordinality w'e gain means 
to discriminate between the many' meanings and so assign a single meaning 
in a given context Amo term represents a v ariable in general, and becomes 
constant or one- valued in a given context, its value being given by that context 
Here we find the main importance of the semantic fact established by 
Skarzenski,*’" that the ‘logical’ freedom from contradiction becomes a semantic

problem of one-value But for application we must have a four-dimensional, 
non-el, A . extensional system, based on structure , and the complete elimina- 
tion of identity (28) 

U) That the disregard of multiordinahty, orders of abstractions, may lead 

to identification and therefore false evaluation resulting in disagreement and 
maladjustment (29) 

V) From (25-29) — it follows that identification or confusion of higher 

order abstractions must be eliminated Because of (7, 9, 10, 25-29 ) — all 
identification must be eliminated (30) 

W) The elimination of identification on all levels, or a complete and 

unconscious discrimination between different orders of abstractions, including 
as a special important case the multiordinahty of terms, results in general 
consciousness of abstracting which in turn, sokes the paradoxes of life and 
mathematics and leads to generalized mathematics along the lines suggested 
by Chwistek (31) 

X) The realization of the inherent multiordinahty of some of the most 

important terms we have, gives us an enormous flexibility of language. It 
makes the number of our words indefinitely great When both the writer and 
the reader recognize this multiordinahty, and look for the meaning in the 
context and discriminate between the orders of abstractions, indicated by the 
context, confusion becomes impossible (32) 

Y) The test for multiordinahty is simple We take any statement and 

test It to see whether a giten term applies to it Then we make a statement 
about this statement and again test if this term applies to the new higher order 
statement If it does, the given term must be considered multiordinal, because 
this procedure may be repeated indefinitely (33) 

Z) The complete elimination of identification does not allow iis to use the 

term ‘is’ of identity, and so we must use operational, functional, actional, 
behaviourislic , languages, requiring new attitudes and new s r, impossible 
without the formulation of a ^-system (34) 

Zi) The s r of those who produced the general theory of relativity, the 
unified field theory, the new quantum mechanics, the new revision of the 
foundation of mathematics , depend on new A, non-el, and non-identity, 
operational, actional . , attitudes (35) 

Zo) As the .4 -system is based on the general elimination of the ‘is’ of 
identity, or on ‘is not', it is impossible to reject these premises without pro- 
ducing impossible data, and a theory of agreement ‘m a finite period’ then 
becomes a possibility (36) 

Z 3 ) The old ‘unknowable’ becomes abolished and limited to the simple 
and natural fact that the objective lex els are not words. ( 37 ) 

Observation and experience, scientific and otherwise, show that in nature 
we find a definite order, which establishes a natural order, namely, that the 
sub-microscopic process, called the exent or the scientific object, came first, 
only later abstracting organisms happened and objects which represent the 
results of abstracting by amoebas or men, came next I n the process of evolution 



A PHYSICO-IMATHEMATICAL RIGOUR 


755 


we find object first, label next Descriptions first, inferences next The above 
natural order establishes also a natural order of evahialwn Proper evalualioii 
becomes the foundation for sunival, non-el s r, the more so since evaluation 
requires asymmetrical relations of 'more’ or ‘less’ , impossible to handle 
properly in an /I -system Thus the most important level is represented by 
the sub-microscopic processes What the' organism needs is not the three- 
dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional event, not the abstraction of low 
order produced by our nervous systems, called the object, but the sub- 
microscopic dynamic processes without which the desired end-results would 
not happen The animal, the primitive, the infant, the ignorant man identify 
the two, live in a delusional world Similarly the objective levels are more 
important than the verbal levels, and descriptions are more important than 
inferences If we identify any orders while the natural order is established b> 
the asymmetrical relation of 'more', the semantic process of evaluation is 
reversed and appears pathological in different degrees If a>h and we make 
them delusionally equal in value (identifj), then, in the false-to-fact relation 
a=h we have either over-evaluated the right-hand side or under-evaluated the 
left-hand side, in both cases reversing the natural order of evaluation It is 
important to notice that by basing oui 5 r on a natural order of evaluation, 
general semantics become a generalized science of order and values, a very 
secure guide in life, indispensable for sanity, as experiments have shown, and 
include also generalized mathematics 

Another very serious mechanism of identification is found in language 

A) Thus we have only one name, say ‘apple’ for the (o) un-spcakable, 

un-eatable event or scientific process, (6) the un-speakable but eatable abstrac- 
tion of low order, the object, (c) the un-spcakable and un-eatable ‘mental’ 
picture, or higher order abstraction, on semantic levels, {d) and for a definition 
on verbal levels (38) 

B) The multiordinality of terms was not discov'ered until 1925 and is still 

generally unknown It presents a serious difficulty facilitating, perhaps even 
necessitating, identification unless prevented by special formulations and 
training. Multiordinal terms sound and look alike on all levels, experience 
has shown how easy it is to confuse their orders and identify the many values 
into one. (39) 

C) The differentiation between descriptions and inferences, and particu- 

larly between descriptive and inferential words as such, is also novel, and was, 
until the present ^-system was formulated, largely disregarded, which again 
led to identifications and false evaluations (40) 

Investigations show, that in all known primitive peoples and in the 
‘mentally’ ill, we find literal identification of different orders of abstractions, 
which accounts for these semantic states Even their ‘perceptions' are different 
from those of the so-called ‘normal’, ‘civilized’ man, because higher order 
abstractions are projected and identified wnth lower order abstractions. They 
identify or ascribe one value to essentially many-valued different orders of

abstractions and so become impervious to contradictions with 'reality' and 
impervious also to higher order experience 

The infant, and the rest of us, identify a great deal because of the reasons 
given above Investigations show that most of human difficulties, public, 
pri\ ate, or scientific are due to this ^ s r, which accounts for the infantile state 
of our commercial so-called cuilizS-tion Identification abolishes the natural 
order of evaluation, but so does also an unconscious assumption of an ‘infinite 
^ elocity’ of a process The A trilogy involved some fanciful ‘infinity’ assump- 
tions Thus in the ^-system the velocity of ner\e currents, which is known 
to be 126 metres per second in the human nervous system, is at present assumed 
unconsciously as infinite', made evident by the elementalism of ‘intellect’ or 
‘emotions' , as something ‘by themselves’ and detached In the £-system 
the length of a line, the space constant, and the natural unit of length were 
assumed 'infinite' In the JV-system the velocity of light, known to be finite, 
was unconsciously assumed to be ‘infinite*. In the A trilogy these unjustified 
or meaningless ‘infinities’ have been eliminated ‘Infinite velonty' of a process 
has no meaning It represents only a play upon s>mbols Velocity is defined 
as v=s/t If we assume i =0 and write »= 5/0=00, this ‘velocity’ lacks one of 
the fundamental factors of its definition, namely, i, and so such an e.xpression 
teases to define anything at all and has no meaning, although it may be a 
symbol for a semantic disturbance But the results of such delusional s r are 
far reaching, no matter how mild they might be in degree In a process propa- 
gated with ‘infinite’ velocity there would be no transition or delay in action, 
and therefore such a process would not be ordered Vice V'ersa, the disregard of 
order in our observations must introduce some mythological ‘infinities’ some- 
where So we see that the semantic process of identification is intimately 
connected with ‘infinity’ assumptions, both abolishing order Training in natural 
order trains j r aw'ay from delusional evaluation, abolishes pathological identi- 
fication of different degrees and fanciful ‘infinities’ 

Thus we see that the problems of mathematical ‘infinity’ are e\tremel> 
complex and involve many fundamental considerations never analysed before 
m connection with the semantic process of identification Once these problems 
are analysed and formulated from a A, non-el, structural point of view the 
problems of ‘excluded third’ become secondary in importance, easily managed 
under the creative freedom of the coveted 'consciousness of abstracting’. 

Let me recall for continuity, that the mathematicians recognize at present, 
two kinds of ‘infinities’. One with which we are familiar from our school days, 
symbolized by 00, Cantor calls ‘potential’ infinity and defines as a variable 
finite, the misunderstanding of which introduces paradoxes even m high schools, 
the other, the ‘actual’ infinity, which introduces paradoxes in universities 
All these paradoxes are due, as the present enquiry shows, to fundamental 
fallacies in connection with semantic processes of identification which we learn 
at home and in elementary schools 

The process of identification of different orders of abstractions may be 
due to pathological conditions, to ignorance, to ‘thoughtlessness’, to lack of 



A PHYSICO-MATHEjMATICAL rigour

observation, to unconscious false assumptions, to hastiness, to superficiality, 
to habits of speech, to the structure of language used , In fact, under the 
^-system it is practically impossible to a\oid it, as we can witness it in such a 
comparatively advanced field as mathematics The label ‘identification’ is 
applied to the semantic process of wrong evaluation going on inside of our 
skins on the un-speakable objectne levefh, when we are not aware of the 
differences between different orders of abstractions When making it conscious, 
we may speak of the confusion of the orders of abstractions To make such a 
process conscious, we must train in the differentiation or discrimination between 
different orders of abstractions, and distinguish the different orders by actually 
learning how to order them Such training results m general consciousness of 
abstracting which is not inborn, nor fully acquired, even in university training, 
but which requires special training Experiments in this field are extremely 
encouraging, in a number of cases, pathological indiriduals ha\e become 
'normal' and the ‘unchangeable’ human nature has been actually changed 
Infantile reactions vn adults are abolished, and this training becomes a general 
and simple method for pre\ention of future semantic disturbances of false 
evaluation which must result in maladjustment 

To stop identification we must discriminate or differentiate to the limit 
between what appears always as four-dimensional, absolute inditidual stages 
of processes and situations on all le\els, verbal included Let us follow briefly 
such an actual performance If we realize (7) — we accept (11-15) — and on 
structural grounds reject the elementalism of the A trilogy as expressed in its 
'psychologj'’, ‘logic', the dnision of ‘space’ and ‘time’, \\e accept the non- 
elementalism of the A trilogy as expressed in the new terms in the present 
work and accept also ‘space-time’. The difference is very serious in all fields, 
when carried consistently all through the system As we actually deal with 
four-dimensional dynamic processes which must be considered continuallj 
different, and with world conditions changing also continually, statements 
about such structural conditions, in an cxtensional sense, must be considered 
as invohing variables, generating propositional functions, doctrinal or sj stem- 
functions, funktors , But propositional functions, which invoke \ariables, 
are neither ‘true’ nor ‘false’, but ambiguous, and to have a proposition we 
must assign a value to the variable by at least permanently, in princijile, 
assigning a date to it We must also introduce, in principle, and as a semantic 
attitude, numerical subscripts to our words Thus ‘apple’ in the ^-sjstem 
represents a name attached to an intensional definition, and space-time con- 
siderations do not enter The term is applied to a definition which might be 
considered as one-valued and permanent Now obviously such a language and 
j r are structurally non-similar to the w'orld and our ner\ous s>stem 

If we try to identify a name for a definition, implying permanence, with 
the obj’ectixe le^el which is made up of absolute indi\iduals, and represents 
e\ er-changmg processes, we must lixe in a delusional world in which we should 
expect every kind of paradoxes and psycho-logical shocks 



758 


SUPPLEMENT III 


In a /I -system, for structural reasons, we must retain the general implica- 
tions of the term ‘apple’, so we retain the word We must make nur language 
extensional in principle, and the name ‘apple’ an individual name, by calling 
it ‘applei’, ‘apple2’, . The combination of letters ‘a-p-p-l-e’ implying similarities, 
the subscripts 1 , 2 . , implying individual differences, which automatically 
prevent identification But this is i*ot enough Our ‘applei’ represents a name 
applied to an object and a process, its meaning becomes only one-valued when 
we assign to it at least a definite date Thus the objective ‘applej i j93i 
may be a very appetizing affair, and 'apple, (j^n i, 1032 1’ a-n un-edible wet splash 
It should be noticed that the fundamental difference between the A and A 
systems turns out to be a difference of semantic attitudes The scientific facts 
are not changed The 'apple' of ‘Adam’ or our own did not differ in essential 
characteristics under discussion In both the A and A systems we actually 
deal, in principle, with many-valued processes The important problem is to 
adjust the structure of our verbal processes to the structure of the world, 
hence a ^-system must be made extensional, non-el, four-dimensional , 
Here once more, as in general semantics, the ascribing of one value (or at least 
limited to a small range of values in practice), in a given situation (context), 
eliminates paradoxes and contradictions on the older ‘logical’ grounds. We 
should notice that the multiordinal terms must be considered as names for 
many -valued s r, depending upon the order of abstractions, hence the name 
multiordinal Names for happenings on the objective levels apply to many- 
valued processes but should not be considered multiordinal All the psycho- 
logies of the differential calculus, ‘space-time’, enter here, yet the whole field 
IS covered semantically if we entirely abandon the ‘is’ of identity Instead of 
training in ‘allness’ and ‘isness’ — ‘this is this', we shall train in non-allness, 
and non-isness — ‘this is not this’, in connection with a special diagram called 
the Structural Differential, 

Experience and experiments show that the aboxe seems essential for 
sanity It is interesting to notice that mathematics has produced a language 
similar in structure to the human nervous system Roughly the central part 
of the brain which we call the thalamus is directly connected with the dynamic 
world through our ‘senses’ and with those semantic manifestations which we 
usually call ‘affective’, ‘emoUoiis’ , all of which manifest themselves as dynamic 
The cortex which gives us the static verbal reactions and definitions, is not 
connected with the outside world directly but receives all impulses through 
the thalamus On semantic levels the thalamus can only deal with dynamic 
material, the cortex with static Obviously for the optimum working of the 
human ner\ ous system, which represents a cyclic chain, where the lower centres 
supply the material for the higher centres and the highei centres should influence 
the lower, we must have means to translate the static into dynamic and the 
dynamic into static, a method supplied exclusively by mathematics 

With the above considerations we must discriminate between our semantic 
capacities for infinite divisibility of finites, and for the generation of infinite 
postulated processes which by definition cannot he exhausted If we use a three-

dimensional A language and apply such an ‘all’ to such an infinite process then 
we simply produce a self-contradiction If we apply to such a semantic process 
a foul 'dimensional ‘all with a date', then we ha\e arrcsled, for the ‘time’ being, 
the process, or taken a static cross section of the infinite process at that date, 
but then we deal with a finite Once we are constantly conscious of abstracting 
m different orders, these subtle differences become quite clear and the solutions 
of the problems of infinity follow a similar path as the older problems of the 
‘infinitesimal’, which also was self-contradictory, unnecessary for mathematics 
When treated as a variable finite it was satisfactory and sufficient, and has 
proven to be a most creative notion in mathematics In the pioblems of the 
irrational, continuity . , similar subtle identifications or non-discriminations 
of el, A, three-dimensional terms with A, non-el, four-dimcnsional terms 
occur, which once eliminated, clear up not only the paradoxes, but some self- 
contradictory, often unconscious, postulates of some parts of mathematics 

Lack of space does not allow me to go into further details, except to suggest 
how some subtle discriminations may help to eliminate identification In my 
-system the differentiation between orders of abstractions on physiological 
grounds, the introduction of multiordinalily of terms, four-dimensional con- 
siderations . , as a structural necessity for all languages, makes the theory of 
types unnecessary 

For a better understanding of the present work we must at least 
differentiate 

A) Between numerical experience and mathematics 

B) Between languages with content and languages without content 

C) Between creative building of verbal schemes which, for the sake of 
generality, have no content, called pure mathematics, and the application of 
these schemes to actual problems, with content, called applied mathematics 

D) Between the contentless mathematics and the investigation of the 
foundation of mathematics w'hich represents the investigation of the j r of 
mathematicians and belongs to a future non-el psycho-logics with content 

E) Between different forms of complex adjustment which we have in 
common with the primitive man, and even the higher animals, and reasoning 
which starts with conscious observations, passing to descriptions and in- 
ferences , . 

F) Between the dynamic process of relating (‘thinking’) on the un- 
speakable semantic levels, and the verbal expression of ‘relations’ 

G) Between the use of negative terms, disagreement, contradiction, and 
self-contradiction. In a ^-system contradictions take the form of self- 
contradictions. 

H) Between el ‘logics' expressed in terms of ‘true’, ‘false’, and modality, 
and the investigations of one-, two-, three-, and oo-valued i r, which become 
a general theory of values, and which may some day include all human interests 

I) Between the inherent circularity of ’human knowledge’, which must 
start wnth sets of undefined terms, and so start with some knowledge, and 
circular definitions or explanations which define or explain nothing 



760 ^ SUPPLEMENT III 

This list of suggestions is not e'vhaustive, and in principle appears as 
inexhaustible I selected only a few topics of immediate need 

We should also notice that because on objectice levels we deal structurally 
with absolutely individual stages of processes and situations and by necessity 
we speak in higher order abstractions and generalities and use many multi- 
ordinal terms (without the use of which no speaking is possible), so any positive 
statement about the objective lev els must be only probable in different degrees, 
which introduces a fundamental and entirely general A principle of uncertainty 
Heisenberg’s restricted principle in physics appears only as a special case 
For structural reasons we must preserve determinism but because of (11-15) — 
the older tvvo-valued determinism must be reformulated into the oo-valued 
determinism of the mavimum probability The einsteinian introduction of 
non-elemcntalism in physics has resulted in the automatic elimination of some 
semantic blockages in the younger phj sicists. Some of the semantic results 
and triumphs of science, besides the new quantum mechanics, can be found in 
the latest (free from identification of the term ‘time’ with some objectivity) 
new entropy of Tolinan ^ 

To sum up, we find that although the primitive man or the ‘mentally’ ill 
may have some reactions of orientation, or capacity for relating, which we have 
in common with the higher animals, yet these do not involve ‘reasoning’ in 
the sense defined before Thus a hover, football player , does a great deal of 
reflexive relating and wins his match, but this cannot be considered as reasoning 
in the strict sense as used in a ^-system If we attempt to discuss something 
with a primitive or ‘mentally’ ill individual and write down his processes of 
relating, we vvmuld have to conclude that he uses onc-valned semantics of identi- 
fication of many values into one, or a semantics of inclusion by which ‘everything 
IS everything else’ The ‘law of contradiction’, or any ‘excluded’ ‘third’, or 
‘ii-th’, practically never appears in our sense, yet it is complicated by the use 
of positive and negative terms, to which any meanings connected with some 
identifications of higher orders may be ascribed Although his prevailing 
semantic processes appear as a complete and literal identification, yet because 
of the general orienting and relating capacities of organisms and the character 
of terms used, it vvmuld not be easy or profitable to attempt an el formulation 
of his ‘laws of thought’ But a semantic formulation, as given above, is very 
instructiv e and comparativ ely simple 

Our existing el ‘logic’, besides the two-valued type of formulation, involves 
many different ‘philosophical’ elucidations, which, instead of clarifying the 
status of ‘logic’, in general, tends only to conceal the important issues involved 
in non-elemcntalism The role that identification plays in a given individual 
appears always as a deciding factoi in his adjustment Unfortunately, at 
present, the sinister identification is not counteracted but fostered or even 
induced by the structure of the languages we use, different mythologies , 
and our whole educational, economic, social , sy stems 

The tvvo-valued A, cl, three-dimensional ‘logic’ does not apply to the 
world of events, to the objective levels , and, for the reasons already explained. 



A PHYSICO-MATHEMATICAL RIGOUR j 761 


does not apply to the study of the foundations of mathematics It applies to 
a large extent to rontentless technical mathematics, including so-called ‘formal 
logic' of that system • 

Formalism when free from identification becomes a unique comparatne 
tool in search for structure, formalism vnlh identification of different orders 
of abstractions, a symptom of semantic disturbances, often of a morbid 
character It should be realized that we may have one-, two-, three- , many-, 
and 00 - valued orientations, which with the exception of one- valued, we should 
utilize when conditions warrant a particular use in a particular case Thus in 
mathematics, for the sake of having mathematics as a standard of evaluation, 
we select a sharply two-valued orientation by w'hich in the old language ‘A is B 
or not B', to allow sharp statements that for instance, 1 -1-1=2 If we would 
deliberately postulate that 1-t-l may sometimes be equal to 2 and sometimes 
not equal to 2, we would ha^e forms of representation which w'ould applj' 
perhaps more readily to science and life, htil mathematics as such would be 
impossible, and we would be deprived of this sharp tool for evaluation 

It is interesting to notice that mathematicians, by the use of tw’o-valued 
semantics, (not 'logic', because an el discipline cannot be 'lived through' at all 
by non-heavily pathological individuals), have produced the most important 
disciplines Thus we have, for instance, the theory of ‘variance’ (the theory 
of function), the theory of invariance, the differential calculus, the 1, 2, 3, 
4, and n-dimensional systems, and a host of other verbal structures similar 
not only to the world, but to the human nervous system. These results give us 
means not only to enlarge our mastery of the external world, but when 
generalized into a non-el, ,4 -system, give us the means for the mastery of the 
inner world, leading toward sanity 

It is amusing to discover, in the twentieth century, that the quarrels 
between two lovers, two mathematicians, two nations, two economic systems . , 
usually assumed insoluble in a ‘finite penod’ should exhibit one mechanism — 
the semantic mechanism of identification — the discovery of which makes 
universal agreement possible, in mathematics and in life

1 — The need of International Languages, or a Universal Language besides 
mathematics is becoming increasingly urgent At present there are several such 
languages, and in many large cities there are organizations, usually called Inter- 
national Auxiliary Language Associations, with addresses listed in telephone direc- 
tories Any of these'organizations will gladly supply information about the whole 
of the international linguistic movement There is also a number of books written 
on this subject to be found m the larger public or university libraries Informa- 
tions about the Basic English of Ogden as a Universal Language, consisting of the 
astonishingly small number of 850 words, which do the work of about 20,000 
words, may be obtained from the Orthological Institijtc, 10 King’s Parade, Cam- 
bridge, England (see also 376, 377) In my opinion, the possibilities of the Basic 
for a scientific civilization are unlimited, provided the Basic is revised from a non- 
aristotelian, non-identity, point of view 

The general and serious defect of all of these languages is, that their authors 
have, as yet, entirely disregarded the non-aristotelian problems of non-identity, 
and so of structure, without which general sanity, or the elimination of delusional 
worlds IS entirely impossible

BIBLIOGRAPHY 


A complete bibliography for a non-arulotchan system would require manj 
volumes and is, therefore, impossible here The formulation of a uan-aristotelian 
system, with the number of scientific facts known in 1933, turned out to be an 
extremely laborious process. 

A non-anstotelian language and attitude differ considerably from the older 
languages and attitudes, and so a first non-aristotelian system has no literature 
which would deal directly with the subject The statement ‘that everything has 
already been said’ is, unfortunately, largely true This introduces serious com- 
plexities, because extremely few men have the genius of a Poincare, and fully 
realize that the language used in making a statement plays an overwhelming role 
as to the consequences which eventually follow If we even grant that ‘every thing 
was said’, I must add, ‘but not so’, and this prevented the budding of a non- 
aristotelian system for more than two thousand years One of the human tragedies 
can be found in the fact that wise epigrams do not work It takes a system which 
often expresses similar notions , but they must be expressed in a unified language 
of different structure to make them workable 

In giving this extremely abbreviated, insufficient, and, perhaps, even poorly 
selected bibliography, I had, in the main, three aims (I) to acknowledge some of 
my direct obligations , (2) to give to the future student an outline of the type of 
literature in existence which has bearing on my subject, and (3) to list such books 
and articles which give further literature. 

1 was particularly careful to list as few scientific periodicals as possible, 
because specialists in a given field do not need them, and laymen do not want 
them In a number of instances, I have listed only one or two of the latest papers 
of an author, which give his previous titles 

Because of the lack of linguistic co-ordination, in most cases, I have had few 
or no opportunities to refer directly to many authors, although the titles of the 
books usually suggest the material needed For further data on a given subject, 
the reader is referred to the respective mdexes As a rule I had to express many 
similar notions, but from a different angle, and in a different language 

I have prefaced the books, parts, and chapters with many important quotations, 
only to show that all modern science requires a fundamental non-arjstotelian 
revision The attentive reader will discover that, although I am in general sympathy 
with these quotations, yet, in many instances, I would have to express them 
differently 

In the case of the two volumes of Colloidal Chemistry edited by Alexander, 
which IS a collection of important contributions by different authors, I would have 
to list about one hundred and twenty more titles, and so I mostly refer to the page 
without giving the name of the author or the title of his contribution, for which 
I apologize In a number of instances I have utilized the material given by Science 
Service, as printed in Science and I indicate such references by inserting before 
giving the date of the issue of Science

The functional or relational conception I matter, mind and, finally, of human 
Miture, seems to be gradually crjstalhsing filn all attempts at scientific synthesis 
Count Korzjbski s work contributes to these clorts m no mean measure I am per- 
haps biassed as a countryman, but to me thi'JPolish attempt at synthesis seems to 
rank as one of the most important I am of lurse unable to express a competent 
judgment on its mathematical, scientific- — in Ine narrow sense of the word — and 
philosophical side As regards however senltics and the anthropological issues 
o '"'i I Count Korzybski, I am in coinjAe agreement with his approach I 
should like to add that the approach is so new ft fundamental that it will take some 
time for us to become completely familiar witlft For the present I should like to 
say that I have not yet mastered all the mtricfts of Count Korzybski’s system, so 
my appreciation must naturally be regarded asfciminary ”

"I am much impressed with tl/profundity of Korzybski’s Scieiics mid Sanity I 
find It hard to get out of the mess of the old aristotelianism and wish that I had 
been able to read this book in i youth, for then I could have acquired the new 
language of relations 

Korzybski’s masterly treati, will act as a powerful force in natural selection 
perhaps, when it brings into ctfmon use the non-anstotelian methods, for it will 
favor in most pursuits those wllare cabbie of conceptual thought and confuse and 
eliminate those who want quick hand decisions such as are usually blurted out with 
great show of confidence Of f thing we may be assured once a man grasps the 
general idea Korzybski is driv it, he cannot fail to look at the world of everyday 
language from a different staii'int 

Korzybski’s criticisms ar^ profound that they change the very foundations 
upon which we have been usee, depend As I look back to my years of travel over 
the world I can see that I did irything I ought not to have done in the u ay of bad 
thinking (we all have done tH suppose, bad thinking must be the common plague 

"rhese last years among 'st Africans in Africa and the West Indies have made 
me realize keenly that primil man itotifies about like the animals do and has no 
consciousness that he abstraot all Of course if we are not conscious of abstract- 
ing in other words, if we o primitives or animals m our nervous reactions, then 
I suppose any kind of malad 'n^t can be expected The simple and efficient neuro- 
psychological non-aristoteli,echnique which Korzybski formulates in his Struc- 
tural Differential for the prse of the elimination of identification holds promises 
that we may Wily outgrthe infantile stage of our civilization I wonder that 
Educators have not already en up this pressing problem and made the climii^tion 
of identification and th acimg of consciousness of abstracting, the mam aims of 

all Korzybsfci’s remarkable book come at the close of 

many years of travel the world,— in savage countries, in the Orient, in South 
America and South — and had they only been a part of my mental training 
before these travels, esults of my observations could hardly have failed to have 
been much nearer tomtualities 

I predict a stc'.'n^ersion to the point of view of this most interesting and 
important work "

“Count ICorzybski’s criticism of the present strWe and usages of human

biological sciences— is timely and well-founded, and is t.xtsed with clearness, vigor 
and fnsigl^ m this interesting book It is certain tlirthi knowledge, if widely 
diffused and acted upon, would greatly alleviate and pe.-h» thove many of the ills 
which afflict the modern world The chief obstacle to Di^^ress is not the lack 
of available knowledge, but the anachronistic survival of m mental habits and 
conceotions which are inconsistent with the facts of natural lity as revealed by 
science These conceptions are firmly rooted m the general id by language and 
emtom What is needed is a far-reaching revision of conceptsid this book points 
wav to such a revision Since we are compelled by the qtions of existence

DOCTOR JOHN A P. MILLET, Psychiatrist, New York City 

“It seems to me that Count Korzybski in his book Science and Sanity calls 
attention to one very important difficulty m tlie thinking process which he so aptly 
sums up as ‘confusion in the orders of abstraction’ We have found through our 
analytical work in dealing with the neuroses that many difficulties m attitude and 
orientation toward life are derived from unconscious identification, a situation which 
leads to a real difficulty in individuation and sometimes makes it permanently 
impossible 

From the psychiatric point of view it seems to me that this one point that Kor- 
zybski has emphasized gives the chief value to his work I doubt whether analysts, 
for the most part, have ever considered the problem of identification from exactly 
this point of \iew Korzybski’s presentation should be interesting to such a group 
and might well lead to further experimental activities in the field of education 
designed to offset the dangers of such identifications 

A beginning has been made in this field already by Korzybski in his development 
of the ‘Structural Differential ' It is too early to say what practical value this Struc- 
tural Diagram may have but the principles of its development are based on the 
conception of ‘order’ in neuro-psycho-logical processes and so provides what might
